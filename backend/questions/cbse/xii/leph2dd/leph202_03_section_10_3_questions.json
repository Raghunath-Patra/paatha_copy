    "explanation": "The change in the speed of light between media causes the wavefront to change direction. When light enters a denser medium (v₂ < v₁), the slower speed causes the wavefront to bend toward the normal, while in a rarer medium (v₂ > v₁) the wavefront bends away from the normal.

One triangle corresponds to the distance traveled in the first medium (v₁τ) and the other to the sphere drawn in the second medium (v₂τ). By comparing the ratios of the sides in these triangles, one obtains sin i / sin r = v₁ / v₂. With the definitions n₁ = c/v₁ and n₂ = c/v₂, this relation can be rearranged to n₁ sin i = n₂ sin r, which is Snell's law.",
    "explanation": "Start by considering a plane wavefront incident on the boundary between two media. For a time interval τ, the distance traveled in medium 1 is v₁τ and in medium 2 is v₂τ. By drawing a sphere of radius v₂τ from the point of incidence, and constructing a tangent to this sphere, triangles are formed that relate the incident and refracted angles with the distances traveled. By equating the corresponding ratios from these triangles and substituting the definitions of refractive index, the formula n₁ sin i = n₂ sin r is obtained.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Total internal reflection occurs when light attempts to move from a denser medium to a rarer medium, and for angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, no refraction occurs. The critical angle (i_c) is defined by sin i_c = n₂/n₁, valid when n₁ > n₂. This condition leads to complete reflection within the medium. Applications include fiber-optic cables, where light is confined within the core due to total internal reflection.",
    "explanation": "When light passes from a denser to a rarer medium, the refraction becomes more pronounced. At a specific angle of incidence, known as the critical angle, the refracted ray travels along the interface (r = 90°). This gives sin i_c = n₂/n₁. For angles greater than i_c, light is completely reflected back into the denser medium. Practical applications of total internal reflection are found in optical fibers, prisms used in binoculars, and devices that rely on controlled light propagation.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A thin convex lens forms a real image because the central part of the incident plane wave, which passes through the thicker part of the lens, experiences a greater delay compared to the edge rays. This delay causes the wavefront to become spherical, converging to a focal point. By considering the optical path differences due to the lower speed of light in glass, Huygens principle explains how the varying phase delays result in the focusing of light.",
    "explanation": "In a convex lens, the central region is thicker than the edges. Although rays through the center travel less distance, they move slower due to the medium’s higher refractive index, causing a delay that matches the longer geometrical path of edge rays. This adjustment in phase across the wavefront transforms a plane wave into a spherical one that converges to the focal point. The principle of equal time taken along all paths from object to image underpins the formation of a real image by a convex lens.",
