In contrast, a full-wave rectifier, typically using a centre-tap transformer and two diodes (or an arrangement with four diodes), rectifies both half-cycles of the AC input, providing a higher average output voltage and a smoother pulsating waveform. The full-wave rectifier is more efficient as it utilizes the entire AC waveform.",
    "explanation": "The half-wave rectifier's simplicity allows it to conduct for only one half-cycle, resulting in significant power loss and a lower average DC output, necessitating more filtering for stable operation. The full-wave rectifier, by rectifying both halves of the AC cycle, provides a waveform with a higher duty cycle and efficiency.

During the positive half-cycle, one end of the secondary becomes positive relative to the centre tap causing the corresponding diode to be forward biased and conduct, while the other diode is reverse biased. In the negative half-cycle, the roles reverse, and the other diode conducts. This alternating conduction results in both half-cycles contributing to the output, which is taken between the common junction of the diodes and the centre tap, yielding a full-wave rectified pulsating dc voltage.",
    "explanation": "The centre-tap transformer provides two equal but opposite AC voltages. Each diode conducts alternately depending on the polarity of its connected terminal.

This results in a smoother dc voltage that is closer to the peak value. To further improve the purity of the dc output, additional filtering stages using an inductor or a combination of capacitor and resistor (RC filter) can be employed, or a voltage regulator can be added to stabilize the output.",
    "explanation": "The effectiveness of a capacitor filter is determined by its ability to maintain a voltage close to the peak value between conduction intervals. A larger capacitance and higher load resistance increase the time constant, which minimizes the voltage drop between peaks. However, if the load current is high, the discharge may be significant, and additional filtering of the residual ripple may be necessary.

    "correct_answer": "Under forward bias, the p-side of the diode is connected to the positive terminal and the n-side to the negative terminal of a battery. This applied voltage opposes the built-in potential (V₀), thereby reducing the barrier height to (V₀ - V). Consequently, the depletion region narrows, allowing carriers from both sides to cross the junction. Specifically, electrons from the n-side and holes from the p-side are injected into the opposite regions—this minority carrier injection results in a steep concentration gradient that causes diffusion of carriers in both directions. The sum of the diffusion currents of electrons and holes constitutes the forward bias current which increases significantly as the applied voltage increases above a certain threshold.",

    "correct_answer": "In forward bias, the applied voltage decreases the barrier potential (V₀ - V), allowing majority carriers to overcome the junction barrier primarily by diffusion, augmented by minority carrier injection. This results in a large exponential increase in current once the threshold voltage is exceeded. In contrast, under reverse bias, the applied voltage increases the barrier potential (V₀ + V), widening the depletion region and preventing carrier diffusion. Only a small drift current flows, carried by the few minority carriers that exist near the junction. The reverse current remains almost constant until breakdown occurs, at which point it increases sharply.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The I-V characteristics of a p-n junction diode are determined by connecting the diode in a circuit with a variable voltage source controlled by a potentiometer or rheostat. In forward bias, a milliammeter is used to measure the relatively large current (in mA), while a microammeter is employed in reverse bias to measure the small reverse saturation current (in µA). As the applied voltage is varied, the corresponding current is recorded and plotted on a graph. The graph typically shows a slow increase in current up to the threshold voltage (cut-in voltage), followed by an exponential increase in current under forward bias. Under reverse bias, the current remains nearly constant until breakdown occurs. This experimental setup helps in understanding the diode's conduction properties and the dynamic resistance in different biasing conditions.",
    "explanation": "The process highlights the importance of careful voltage control and current measurement. The significant change in current beyond the threshold voltage in forward bias and the near-constant reverse saturation current until breakdown in reverse bias are key aspects of diode functionality.",

This process releases an electron into the conduction band and creates a corresponding hole in the valence band. With increased temperature, more electrons gain sufficient energy to transition, thereby increasing the intrinsic carrier concentration. However, as electrons are promoted, recombination processes simultaneously occur to maintain equilibrium.",
    "explanation": "At temperatures above 0 K, the available thermal energy enables electrons to gain enough kinetic energy to break their covalent bonds, resulting in their transition from the valence band to the conduction band. This ionization process creates electron-hole pairs, which are crucial for conduction. The rate of electron generation increases with temperature, as described by the exponential dependence on the energy gap in the intrinsic carrier concentration formula.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "At 0 K, the energy band diagram shows a completely filled valence band and an empty conduction band, indicating that the intrinsic semiconductor behaves as an insulator since no free carriers are available for conduction. At T > 0 K, thermal energy excites electrons, causing some to move to the conduction band, leaving behind holes in the valence band. This results in the formation of electron-hole pairs that contribute to electrical conduction, thus changing the semiconductor's behavior from insulating to conducting.",
    "explanation": "The energy band diagram at 0 K reflects a state of no thermal excitation where the energy gap (E₉) prevents any electrons from entering the conduction band. When the temperature rises above 0 K, electrons gain enough energy to bridge the gap and form electron-hole pairs, illustrated in the T > 0 K diagram.

    "correct_answer": "Intrinsic semiconductors are pure materials where charge carriers are generated only by thermal excitation, whereas extrinsic semiconductors are doped with impurities to increase the charge carrier concentration.",
    "explanation": "Intrinsic semiconductors have low conductivity as the carrier generation occurs only due to thermal effects. Extrinsic semiconductors use doping to introduce additional free electrons or holes, thereby greatly increasing the conductivity.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "It is important because if the dopant atom is too different in size, it can distort the crystal lattice, adversely affecting the material's electronic properties.",
    "explanation": "For successful doping without significant lattice distortion, the size compatibility between the dopant and the host semiconductor atoms is crucial. This ensures that the dopant occupies a lattice site properly and maintains the crystal structure while introducing free charge carriers.",

    "correct_answer": "Donor impurities in n-type semiconductors donate extra electrons, making electrons the majority carriers and reducing the hole concentration, while acceptor impurities in p-type semiconductors create holes, making holes the majority carriers and reducing the electron concentration.",
    "explanation": "In extrinsic semiconductors, donor dopants (pentavalent elements) release extra electrons, greatly increasing the electron density compared to holes. Conversely, acceptor dopants (trivalent elements) create holes by lacking one electron for bonding, hence increasing the hole count relative to electrons.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A p-n junction is formed by bringing together p-type and n-type semiconductor regions. Due to the concentration gradient, holes from the p-side diffuse into the n-side and electrons from the n-side diffuse into the p-side. This movement of carriers creates regions of immobile ionized acceptors on the p-side and donors on the n-side, referred to as the space-charge or depletion region. As the region depletes of mobile carriers, an electric field is established opposing further diffusion. This field drives a drift current that counters the diffusion current. Equilibrium is reached when the magnitude of the diffusion current equals that of the drift current, resulting in no net current across the junction.",
    "explanation": "The formation of the p-n junction starts with the diffusion of majority carriers (electrons and holes) across the junction. This carrier movement leaves behind ionized dopant atoms forming the depletion region. The built-in electric field due to these fixed charges generates a drift current which opposes further carrier diffusion. When the drift and diffusion currents balance, the junction reaches equilibrium.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Doping with pentavalent impurities introduces an extra energy level, known as the donor level, slightly below the conduction band (about 0.01 eV for germanium and 0.05 eV for silicon). This allows electrons to be easily excited into the conduction band at room temperature. On the other hand, doping with trivalent impurities creates an acceptor level slightly above the valence band; electrons from the valence band require only a small amount of energy to jump to this level, leaving behind mobile holes. These modifications result in n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively, which have differing Fermi level positions and majority carriers.",
    "explanation": "In n-type semiconductors, donor levels provided by pentavalent dopants lie close to the conduction band, hence requiring minimal energy for electron excitation. In p-type semiconductors, acceptor levels lie near the valence band, leading to an increase in hole concentration. The band diagram thus shifts the effective Fermi level toward the conduction band for n-type and toward the valence band for p-type materials.",
