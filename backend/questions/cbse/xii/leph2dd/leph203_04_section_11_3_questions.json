    "correct_answer": "Hallwachs and Lenard conducted experiments using evacuated glass tubes with metal electrodes. Hallwachs used a negatively charged zinc plate and observed that its charge diminished upon exposure to ultraviolet light, leading him to conclude that negative particles were emitted. Lenard allowed ultraviolet light to fall on one electrode (the emitter) in an evacuated tube, which resulted in a current flow when electrons were attracted to the positively charged collector plate by the electric field. Both experiments demonstrated that light incident on a metal surface causes electron emission.",
    "explanation": "Both scientists designed experiments to study the influence of ultraviolet light on metal surfaces. Hallwachs observed changes in electrical charge on a zinc plate, indicating loss of electrons, while Lenard's setup allowed for the measurement of current flow due to the photoelectrons traveling through an electric field. Their observations provided critical evidence linking light with the emission of electrons from metals, a phenomenon that would later be crucial in quantum theory.",

    "explanation": "Hertz's experiments were critical because they provided the first experimental evidence of the photoelectric effect, even though he did not interpret the underlying mechanism.

    "correct_answer": "Metals such as zinc have higher work functions, meaning they require the higher energy of ultraviolet photons to emit electrons. In contrast, alkali metals have low work functions, allowing them to emit electrons when illuminated by lower energy, visible light. This difference in work functions explains the variation in response to incident light across different metals.",
    "explanation": "The work function of a metal is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from its surface. Metals with high work functions need photons of higher frequency (and thus higher energy) to overcome this barrier, which is why they generally respond only to ultraviolet light. Alkali metals, with their lower work functions, can emit electrons with the energy provided by visible light.
