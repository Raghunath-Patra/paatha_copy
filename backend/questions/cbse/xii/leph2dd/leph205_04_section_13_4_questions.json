    "correct_answer": "Einstein's mass-energy equivalence demonstrates that even a small loss of mass (mass defect) can be converted into a large amount of energy. In nuclear reactions, when nucleons combine to form a nucleus, the mass of the nucleus is less than the combined masses of the individual nucleons. This missing mass is converted into binding energy, which holds the nucleus together. Therefore, when nuclear reactions occur—either by splitting heavy nuclei (fission) or combining light nuclei (fusion)—the changes in binding energy result in significant energy release.",
    "explanation": "The equation E = mc² shows that mass and energy are interchangeable. In nuclear reactions, the mass defect represents the mass that has been converted to binding energy.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The graph shows that for light nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon increases sharply with increasing mass number, indicating that combining light nuclei in fusion leads to a more stable (tightly bound) nucleus and releases energy. For medium-mass nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon remains nearly constant, reflecting the saturation effect of the nuclear force. For heavy nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon gradually decreases, meaning these nuclei are less tightly bound; splitting them into medium-mass nuclei (fission) results in an increase in binding energy per nucleon and thus releases energy.",
    "explanation": "The graph illustrates that nuclear stability peaks around medium-mass nuclei (near iron). Light nuclei get an energy boost when fused because their nucleons become more tightly bound, while heavy nuclei can release energy by splitting, as the fragments have higher binding energy per nucleon.
