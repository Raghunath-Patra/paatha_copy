    "explanation": "In a plasma, particles move at high speeds. By raising the temperature, the average kinetic energy of particles increases.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Nuclear fission releases energy that is orders of magnitude larger than that released in chemical reactions. In nuclear fission, the energy comes from a change in the binding energy per nucleon, which involves differences of several MeV per nucleon. In contrast, chemical reactions involve changes in chemical binding energies (electron bonds) which are typically of the order of electron volts. This difference arises because the strong nuclear force (responsible for nuclear binding energy) is much stronger than the electromagnetic interactions that govern chemical bonding.",
    "explanation": "In fission, a heavy nucleus splits into lighter fragments that have a higher binding energy per nucleon. The mass difference (mass defect) between the original nucleus and the products is converted into energy using Einstein’s equation (E = m·c^2), resulting in energy releases on the scale of 200 MeV per fission event. Chemical reactions, however, only rearrange electrons in bonds without changing the nucleus, and the energy changes per bond are roughly 1 to 3 eV, which is about a million times smaller. Thus, even though both processes involve energy changes due to binding energy differences, the fundamental forces and energy scales involved are very different.",

Two helium-3 nuclei then combine to form helium-4 while releasing two protons. The net reaction is 4 H -> He + 2 ν + 6 γ + about 26.7 MeV of energy.",
    "explanation": "The cycle involves multiple steps: first, two protons fuse to create a deuteron, emitting a positron and a neutrino; second, the deuteron fuses with a proton to form helium-3; finally, two helium-3 nuclei fuse to produce helium-4 and release two protons. The overall effect is the conversion of four protons into one helium-4 nucleus, accompanied by the emission of neutrinos, gamma rays, and a net energy release of approximately 26.7 MeV.

    "correct_answer": "Controlled thermonuclear fusion requires heating nuclear fuel to extremely high temperatures (around 10^8 K) so that the positively charged nuclei have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb barrier. At such high temperatures, the fuel exists as a plasma, which is difficult to confine since no conventional material container can withstand these temperatures. Magnetic or inertial confinement techniques are used, but achieving and maintaining the necessary conditions for sustained fusion remains a significant technical challenge.",
    "explanation": "In controlled fusion experiments, the challenge is twofold. First, the plasma must be heated to temperatures high enough (on the order of 10^8 K) so that a significant fraction of the nuclei have energies to overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion. Second, once the fuel is in the plasma state, it must be confined long enough for fusion reactions to occur. Magnetic confinement (using devices such as tokamaks) and inertial confinement (using lasers) are the primary methods under investigation, but both face difficulties in maintaining stability, achieving the required plasma density, and preventing energy losses.",
