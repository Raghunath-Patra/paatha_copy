By adding these equations and assuming the lens is thin so that the distance between the surfaces is negligible, we obtain n1/u + n1/v = (n2 - n1)(1/R1 - 1/R2).

    "correct_answer": "In a double convex lens, image formation occurs in two steps. First, the ray of light refracts at the first spherical surface and forms an intermediate image I1. This intermediate image then acts as a virtual object for the second spherical surface. In the second step, refraction at the second surface produces the final image I. This two-step process necessitates using the refraction formula twice—once for each surface—and the overall image properties are determined by combining the results of both steps.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains that the first surface creates a real or virtual intermediate image that serves as the object for the second surface.

    "correct_answer": "When a convex lens is immersed in water, the difference in refractive indices between the lens material and the surrounding medium decreases. This change alters the refraction conditions at its surfaces. Using the lens maker's formula, one can show that the effective focal length increases because the term (n2 - n1) becomes smaller when n1 (water) is closer to n2 (glass) compared to air. For example, if a lens has a focal length of +20 cm in air, it might have a focal length of +78.2 cm in water.",
    "explanation": "A detailed analysis involves applying the lens maker's formula for both conditions. In air, n1 is 1 and in water, n1 is approximately 1.33. The reduced contrast in refractive indices causes the lens to bend light less steeply, thereby increasing the focal length.",
