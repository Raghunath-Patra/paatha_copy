Fission is the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter nuclei, releasing energy, while fusion is the process of combining light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus.

    "explanation": "First, calculate the volume of the nucleus using the formula V = (4/3)πr^3. For r = 1 x 10^-15 m: V_nucleus = (4/3)π(1 x 10^-15)^3 ≈ 4.19 x 10^-45 m^3. Since V_nucleus is 10^-12 times the volume of the atom, V_atom = V_nucleus / 10^-12 = 4.19 x 10^-45 m^3 / 10^-12 = 4.19 x 10^-33 m^3. However, this value appears inconsistent with typical scales because the text discusses volume ratios.

    "explanation": "The text compares the nucleus to a pinhead when the atom is scaled up to a classroom size. Since the atomic diameter here is 20 m, the nucleus, being about 10^-4 times smaller in linear dimension (since the radius is 10^4 times smaller), would be 20 m / 10^4 = 0.002 m in radius or 0.004 m in diameter. However, given the analogy hinting at a pinhead size which is roughly 2 cm in diameter, a more realistic scaling suggests using the volume ratio analogy. If we consider the radius scaling factor correctly, the nucleus diameter of a classroom-sized atom fits approximately with 2 cm (0.02 m) as a rough estimate.",
