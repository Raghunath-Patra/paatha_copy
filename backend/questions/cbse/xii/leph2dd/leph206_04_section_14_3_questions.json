    "correct_answer": "The diamond-like structure features each Si or Ge atom tetrahedrally bonded to four neighbors through covalent bonds.

Under thermal excitation, electrons can break free from their bonds and move to the conduction band, generating electron-hole pairs. This process is fundamental to the semiconducting properties of these materials.",
    "explanation": "The tetrahedral bonding configuration in the diamond-like structure ensures strong, directional covalent bonds, which are responsible for the stability of the crystal at low temperatures. When thermal energy is supplied, these covalent bonds can be partially broken, allowing electrons to transition to the conduction band and creating holes in the valence band.

    "correct_answer": "Thermal energy provides the necessary excitation for electrons in the valence band to overcome the energy gap (E₉) and move into the conduction band. This process releases an electron into the conduction band and creates a corresponding hole in the valence band. With increased temperature, more electrons gain sufficient energy to transition, thereby increasing the intrinsic carrier concentration. However, as electrons are promoted, recombination processes simultaneously occur to maintain equilibrium.",
    "explanation": "At temperatures above 0 K, the available thermal energy enables electrons to gain enough kinetic energy to break their covalent bonds, resulting in their transition from the valence band to the conduction band. This ionization process creates electron-hole pairs, which are crucial for conduction. The rate of electron generation increases with temperature, as described by the exponential dependence on the energy gap in the intrinsic carrier concentration formula. The simultaneous recombination of electrons and holes ensures that the system remains in equilibrium.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "At 0 K, the energy band diagram shows a completely filled valence band and an empty conduction band, indicating that the intrinsic semiconductor behaves as an insulator since no free carriers are available for conduction. At T > 0 K, thermal energy excites electrons, causing some to move to the conduction band, leaving behind holes in the valence band. This results in the formation of electron-hole pairs that contribute to electrical conduction, thus changing the semiconductor's behavior from insulating to conducting.",
    "explanation": "The energy band diagram at 0 K reflects a state of no thermal excitation where the energy gap (E₉) prevents any electrons from entering the conduction band. When the temperature rises above 0 K, electrons gain enough energy to bridge the gap and form electron-hole pairs, illustrated in the T > 0 K diagram. This transition explains why intrinsic semiconductors exhibit insulating behavior at very low temperatures and become conductive at higher temperatures due to the presence of mobile charge carriers.",
