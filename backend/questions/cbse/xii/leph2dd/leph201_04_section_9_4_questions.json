    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": [
      "A. It occurs when light is incident from a rarer medium onto a denser medium.",
      "B. It occurs when light is incident from a denser medium onto a rarer medium and is completely reflected.",
      "C. It occurs when the light is partially absorbed and partially transmitted.",
      "D. It occurs only when the reflecting surface is perfectly smooth."

    "correct_answer": "B. It occurs when light is incident from a denser medium onto a rarer medium and is completely reflected.",
    "explanation": "Total internal reflection happens when light travels from a denser to a rarer medium and the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, resulting in all the light being reflected with no transmission.",
