    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Young's double-slit experiment provided definitive proof of the wave nature of light by demonstrating interference patterns. The experiment showed that when light passes through two closely spaced slits, the emerging light waves interfere with each other, producing alternating bright and dark fringes on a screen. This interference can only occur if the light waves are coherent, meaning they have a fixed phase relationship. Young achieved coherence by using a single light source and splitting it into two beams that retain their phase relationship. This experiment challenged the earlier particle theory of light and laid the foundation for the modern understanding of wave optics.",
    "explanation": "The experiment was significant because it directly visualized interference — a phenomenon characteristic of waves. The ability to generate and observe coherent light allowed scientists to understand properties like wavelength and phase differences. Moreover, Young's experiment was instrumental in reviving the wave theory of light, influencing further studies in optics and quantum mechanics.",

    "correct_answer": "Starting with the condition for constructive interference, the path difference between the two slits must be nλ. For small angles, the path difference can be approximated by x*d/D, where x is the position of the fringe, d is the slit separation, and D is the distance to the screen. Equating x*d/D = nλ gives x = nλD/d, which shows that the spacing between successive fringes is λD/d.",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins with the observation that, for constructive interference, the extra distance traveled by light from one slit relative to the other must equal an integer multiple of the wavelength (nλ). Using the small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ x/D), the difference in path length is approximated as d*sinθ ≈ d*(x/D). Setting this equal to nλ and solving for x gives the position of the nth bright fringe as x = nλD/d. The spacing between successive fringes is therefore λD/d.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Clear interference fringes in Young's experiment depend on several factors: the slit separation must be small compared to the distance to the screen, the light must be highly monochromatic and coherent, and environmental vibrations or imperfections in the slit structure can blur the pattern. To improve the experiment, one could use lasers as the light source since they offer high coherence and monochromaticity, ensure precise fabrication of the slits to maintain uniform separation, and isolate the setup from vibrations. Additionally, using a longer distance between the slits and the screen can help in resolving the fringe pattern more clearly.",
    "explanation": "The quality of the interference pattern is sensitive to the coherence length of the light source and the precision of the experimental setup. A non-coherent source, slight vibrations, or inaccuracies in slit dimensions can degrade the pattern. By addressing these issues—using more coherent light sources like lasers, employing precise manufacturing techniques for the slits, and stabilizing the experimental setup—the clarity of the interference fringes can be significantly improved.",
