    "correct_answer": "no different from",
    "explanation": "In both Thomson’s and Rutherford’s models the overall size of the atom is determined by the outer boundary where the electrons are found. In Thomson’s model the positive charge is spread throughout the atom while in Rutherford’s model most of the charge is concentrated in a very small nucleus, but the electron cloud still occupies the same overall volume.",

Converting this to joules (12.75 eV x 1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV = 2.04 x 10^-18 J) and using E = hc/λ with h = 6.6 x 10^-34 J s and c = 3 x 10^8 m/s, the wavelength is λ = (6.6 x 10^-34 x 3 x 10^8) / (2.04 x 10^-18) ≈ 9.7 x 10^-8 m (or 97 nm).

    "explanation": "According to Bohr's model, the electron speed in the ground state is approximately 2.2 x 10^6 m/s. Since the speed is inversely proportional to the principal quantum number (v ∝ 1/n), v for n = 2 is about 2.2 x 10^6 / 2 = 1.1 x 10^6 m/s, and for n = 3 it is about 2.2 x 10^6 / 3 ≈ 0.73 x 10^6 m/s.
