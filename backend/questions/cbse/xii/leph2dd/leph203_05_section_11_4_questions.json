The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency required to overcome the work function of the material; below this frequency, no electrons are emitted regardless of light intensity.",
    "explanation": "According to Einstein's photoelectric equation, the energy of the incident photon (hv) must exceed the work function (Ï†) of the metal for electrons to be emitted.

    "explanation": "With an increasing positive potential, more electrons, even those with lower kinetic energy, are attracted to the collector, leading to an increase in current until every emitted electron is collected (saturation).

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experimental setup consists of an evacuated glass or quartz tube to avoid collisions of photoelectrons with air molecules. A thin photosensitive plate (cathode) emits electrons when irradiated with monochromatic light, and an opposing metal plate (anode) collects these electrons. Monochromatic light of a sufficiently short wavelength is directed through a quartz window, which allows ultraviolet light to pass. The potential difference across the plates, controlled and varied using a battery and a commutator (allowing reversal of polarity), is measured using a voltmeter. A microammeter records the photocurrent, which depends on the lightâ€™s intensity and frequency. This setup allows detailed study of how photoelectrons are emitted and the relationship between stopping potential and frequency.",
    "explanation": "The arrangement is critical to isolating the effects of light on electron emission.

    "correct_answer": "The linear relationship indicates that the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons (given by eV0) is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light minus the work function, as expressed in Einstein's photoelectric equation (Kmax = hv - Ï†). This relationship supports the quantization of light energy, demonstrating that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. The straight-line graph with a slope of h/e provides experimental evidence for the photon theory of light and confirms that the electron emission process is not dependent on the intensity of the light but on its frequency.",
    "explanation": "Einsteinâ€™s equation (hv - Ï† = eV0) predicts a linear dependence of the stopping potential on the frequency of the incident light. The intercept of the line on the frequency axis gives the threshold frequency, and the slope allows determination of Planck's constant (when multiplied by the electron charge).

    "correct_answer": "The stopping potential measures the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, which depends solely on the energy of the individual photons (determined by the frequency) and the material's work function. Increasing the intensity of light increases the number of photons (and hence the number of emitted electrons) but does not change the energy carried by each photon. Therefore, while the saturation current increases with intensity, the maximum kinetic energyâ€”and thus the stopping potentialâ€”remains unchanged.",
    "explanation": "This behavior is a direct consequence of the quantization of light. Since the energy of a photon is given by hv, where h is Planck's constant and v is the frequency, varying the intensity only affects the number of photons and not their individual energies.
