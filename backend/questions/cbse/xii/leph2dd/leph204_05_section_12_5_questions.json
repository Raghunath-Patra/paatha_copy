Since both n_i and n_f are integers, this produces photons with discrete energies, which are observed as distinct emission lines in the spectrum.",
    "explanation": "The process involves an electron losing energy by dropping to a lower energy level. The energy lost (E_ni - E_nf) is carried away by a photon, whose frequency is given by v = (E_ni - E_nf) / h.

This breakthrough provided a critical stepping stone in the development of quantum theory by showing that atomic properties are not continuous but quantized.",
