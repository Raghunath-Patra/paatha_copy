This assumption successfully explained the discrete line spectra observed in hydrogen.",
    "explanation": "Rutherford’s model could not explain atomic stability or the discrete spectral lines since classical physics would allow continuous energy loss.

    "correct_answer": "By combining Bohr's two key postulates—the existence of stable orbits in which electrons do not radiate energy, and the quantization of angular momentum (L = n × h/2π)—with the balance of centripetal force and Coulomb attraction (m × v²/r = k × e²/r²), one can derive expressions for the electron velocity and orbit radius. Substituting these into the total energy expression (kinetic plus potential energy) leads to a formula for the energy levels that simplifies to Eₙ = -me⁴/(8n²ε₀²h²), which, upon substitution of known constants for hydrogen, becomes Eₙ = -13.6/n² eV.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts by equating the centripetal force required to keep the electron in circular motion with the Coulomb force between the positively charged nucleus and the electron. Using the quantized angular momentum condition allows solving for the radius and velocity in terms of n. Inserting these into the expression for total energy (kinetic energy plus potential energy) and simplifying yields the formula for the energy levels of hydrogen, clearly indicating that the levels become less negative (less bound) with increasing n.",
