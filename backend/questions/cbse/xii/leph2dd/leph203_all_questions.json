Metals with high work functions need photons of higher frequency (and thus higher energy) to overcome this barrier, which is why they generally respond only to ultraviolet light.

A thin photosensitive plate (cathode) emits electrons when irradiated with monochromatic light, and an opposing metal plate (anode) collects these electrons. Monochromatic light of a sufficiently short wavelength is directed through a quartz window, which allows ultraviolet light to pass. The potential difference across the plates, controlled and varied using a battery and a commutator (allowing reversal of polarity), is measured using a voltmeter.

However, experiments show that photoelectron emission is instantaneous and that there exists a threshold frequency below which no emission occurs.

This quantization explains why electrons are emitted immediately once the energy of a single photon exceeds the work function, regardless of the overall intensity of light.",

Einstein proposed that these quanta, later called photons, carry momentum p = hv/c. This particle-like behavior was necessary to explain phenomena such as the immediate ejection of electrons when light of sufficient frequency was incident on a metal surface, and it was later confirmed by experiments like the Compton scattering experiment. Overall, the distinct energy and momentum properties provided strong evidence that light behaves as particles.",
    "explanation": "The realization that light can behave as both a wave and a particle was a major milestone in quantum physics. The photoelectric effect challenged the classical wave theory by showing that light must be quantized, leading to the concept of the photon.

    "correct_answer": "Einstein's photoelectric equation, eV₀ = hv - φ₀, clearly shows that the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the frequency (v) of the incident light and not on its intensity. This finding supports the quantum view of light, where each photon has a fixed energy (hv). Changing the intensity of the light alters the number of photons striking the metal, but does not change the energy of individual photons. Therefore, only light with a frequency above a threshold (determined by the work function φ₀) can eject electrons.",
    "explanation": "The equation exemplifies one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics by separating the concepts of energy per photon and the photon flux.

    "correct_answer": "The Compton scattering experiment demonstrated that when X-rays collide with electrons, the scattered X-rays have longer wavelengths. This change in wavelength could only be explained if the X-rays were treated as particles (photons) that carry momentum. By applying the conservation of energy and momentum to the collision between the photon and an electron, the observed shift in wavelength (Compton shift) was accurately predicted. This result provided strong evidence that light exhibits particle-like properties.",
    "explanation": "The experiment relied on the principle that both energy and momentum must be conserved in collisions. When a photon collides with an electron, part of the photon's energy is transferred to the electron, resulting in a reduction in the photon's energy and an increase in its wavelength. The quantitative agreement between the observed and predicted wavelength changes confirmed the particle theory of light and underscored the significance of conservation laws in understanding quantum phenomena.",

    "correct_answer": "The dual nature of light is demonstrated through experiments that show both wave-like and particle-like behavior. Interference, diffraction, and polarization effects are well explained by the wave theory, where light exhibits properties such as wavelength and frequency. On the other hand, phenomena like the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering, which involve quantized energy and momentum transfer, require the photon picture of light. The appropriate description depends on the experiment: the wave description is used to explain how light is focused (e.g., in the eye lens), while the photon description explains how light is absorbed (e.g., by the retina).",
    "explanation": "This answer examines the dual nature of light by giving examples of experiments favoring each description. Wave properties are evident from interference and diffraction experiments, whereas the energy quanta observed in the photoelectric and Compton effects necessitate a particle description.

The proposal also provided experimental predictions, such as electron diffraction, that were later confirmed, solidifying the dual nature of matter.",
    "explanation": "De Broglie's idea introduced a symmetry between energy and matter, challenging classical physics and laying the foundation for modern quantum theory.

For typical macroscopic objects, the resulting wavelength is exceedingly small, far below the limits of current detection technology. Environmental disturbances, quantum decoherence, and the precision required in measurement apparatus would further complicate the experiment.",
    "explanation": "The de Broglie wavelength for macroscopic objects is practically negligible due to high mass and speed, yielding values many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic scale. In addition, interference effects, which are key to detecting wave properties, become undetectable due to decoherence and instrumental limitations.
