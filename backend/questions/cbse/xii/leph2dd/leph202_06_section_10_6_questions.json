    "correct_answer": "Interference and diffraction are both phenomena that result from the wave nature of light. Interference typically involves the superposition of waves from a few coherent sources, leading to distinct patterns such as those observed in Young's double-slit experiment. Diffraction, on the other hand, occurs when waves spread out after passing through an aperture or around an obstacle, producing a pattern of a broad central maximum with diminishing secondary fringes. As Feynman points out, the primary difference is the number of sources involved; when only a few sources interfere, the phenomenon is called interference, while a large number of sources results in a diffraction pattern. Moreover, in practical experiments like the double-slit experiment, the overall pattern is a combination of both single-slit diffraction effects from each slit and the interference between the slits.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains how interference and diffraction are related, highlighting that both involve the superposition of waves, yet differ in the number of contributing sources.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a single-slit diffraction pattern, the central maximum is the brightest, and the intensity of secondary maxima decreases with increasing angle from the center. This occurs because the light waves emanating from different parts of the slit undergo phase differences that lead to constructive interference only near the center. As the angle increases, the differences in path length cause more destructive interference among the waves. The division of the slit into many small sources (as per Huygens' principle) results in less coherent addition of amplitudes at points further from the center, thereby reducing the observed intensity.",
    "explanation": "The explanation is based on the concept that the summing of waves with different phases leads to a decrease in net amplitude (and thus intensity) when the phase differences produce partial or complete cancellation. The calculation of intensity is linked directly to the interference of many secondary sources, with the central maximum corresponding to a point of complete constructive interference.",
