    "correct_answer": "When a light ray in air (a less optically dense medium) strikes the boundary of a denser medium, it bends toward the normal. The angle between the incident ray and the normal is the angle of incidence, and the angle between the refracted ray and the normal is the angle of refraction. Snell's Law, which states that (sine of angle of incidence)/(sine of angle of refraction) equals the refractive index n21, governs this process. Since n21 is greater than 1 for a denser medium, the refracted ray deviates toward the normal.",
    "explanation": "This answer describes how a ray of light changes direction at the interface between two media.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The apparent depth of an object seen through a refractive medium, like water, is given by the formula: apparent depth equals real depth divided by the refractive index of the medium. This means that for an object at a real depth h2, the observer perceives it at an apparent depth h1 = h2/n, where n is the refractive index of water relative to air. The refractive index slows down the light rays as they exit the water, bending the rays such that they seem to originate from a shallower point. This relationship is significant in various applications, including underwater imaging and designing optical instruments.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The relationship n12 = 1/n21 indicates that the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2 is the reciprocal of that of medium 2 with respect to medium 1. This reciprocal nature is crucial in optical experiments as it ensures consistency in the behavior of light when it passes from one medium to the other and then returns to the original medium. For example, when designing optical instruments like lenses and prisms, understanding this relationship helps in predicting the path of light accurately. It further implies that if a light ray bends a certain way when entering a medium, it will exhibit reverse behavior when exiting the medium, leading to phenomena like the parallel emergence of the ray from a rectangular slab.",
