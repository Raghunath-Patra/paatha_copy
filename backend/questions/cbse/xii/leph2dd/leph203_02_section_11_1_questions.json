    "correct_answer": "Thomson's method involved passing cathode rays through a region where perpendicular electric and magnetic fields were applied. By adjusting the fields until the net deflection was zero, he equated the electric force to the magnetic force and deduced the velocity of the electrons. Using this velocity and measurements of deflection when only one field was applied, he calculated the specific charge (e/m) of the electrons.",
    "explanation": "The experiment forced cathode rays into a region where the electric force (eE) and magnetic force (e v B) exactly counterbalanced one another, allowing the electrons to travel in a straight line. This balance gave the condition eE = e v B, from which the speed v = E/B was calculated. With the electron speed known, further deflection measurements allowed for the calculation of the ratio e/m, proving to be independent of the cathode material or the gas used.",
