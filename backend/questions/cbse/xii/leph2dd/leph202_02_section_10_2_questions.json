    "correct_answer": "Huygens principle states that every point on an existing wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets that propagate with the same speed as the original wave. To determine the new position of the wavefront after a given time, spheres (or circles in 2D) of radius equal to the product of the wave speed and time elapsed are drawn from each point on the wavefront. The common tangent to all these secondary wavelets defines the new wavefront. This process accounts for both the forward movement of the wave and the resulting curvature of the wavefront in different propagation scenarios.",
    "explanation": "By applying Huygens principle, we start with the given wavefront at time t = 0. Each point on this wavefront emits a secondary wavelet. After a time interval τ, the wavelets have a radius of vτ. The envelope of these wavelets, found by drawing the common tangent that touches all the wavelets, forms the new wavefront at t = τ.

However, Huygens argued, via an ad hoc assumption, that the amplitude of secondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the backward direction. More rigorous wave theory, using principles such as interference and diffraction, explains that destructive interference and boundary conditions effectively negate the formation of a significant backwave.",
    "explanation": "The original Huygens model exhibits a theoretical backwave that is not observed in practice. Huygens resolved this discrepancy by assuming zero backward amplitude in an ad hoc manner. Subsequent wave theories, including the Kirchhoff integral theorem and other rigorous treatments of wave propagation, use interference patterns and boundary conditions to show that the backward-propagating wavelets cancel out through destructive interference, thereby justifying the absence of a backwave.",
