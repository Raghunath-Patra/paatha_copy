    "correct_answer": "Rutherford's scattering experiment involved directing a beam of alpha particles at a thin metal foil and measuring the scattering angles. Most particles passed through undeflected, but a few were deflected at large angles. This indicated that a small, dense region of positive charge (the nucleus) existed within the atom, which caused the significant deflections. The unexpected high-angle scattering could only be explained if nearly all of the atom's mass and positive charge were concentrated in a tiny nucleus, leading to the abandonment of the plum pudding model in favor of the nuclear model.",
    "explanation": "In the experiment, the observation that most alpha particles barely deflect suggested that most of the atom is empty space, while the few particles that deflected sharply indicated encounters with a small, massive, and positively charged nucleus. These findings were contrary to the predictions of a uniform charge distribution and were pivotal in forming the modern model of the atom.",

    "correct_answer": "The planetary model, where electrons orbit a central nucleus like planets around the sun, successfully incorporated Rutherford's findings by including a nucleus. However, it could not explain why electrons do not radiate energy and spiral into the nucleus, as classical electrodynamics would predict continuous radiation and energy loss. Furthermore, it failed to account for the discrete spectral lines observed. Quantum theory, with the introduction of quantized energy levels and wave-particle duality, resolved these issues by showing that electrons can only exist in specific energy states and make transitions between these levels without radiating energy continuously.",
    "explanation": "While the planetary model advanced our understanding by introducing the nuclear structure of the atom, it was inconsistent with the observed stability of atoms and the discrete nature of spectral emissions. Quantum theory’s postulation of quantized electron orbits provided explanations for atomic stability and the mechanisms behind discrete spectral lines, marking a significant improvement over the classical picture.",
