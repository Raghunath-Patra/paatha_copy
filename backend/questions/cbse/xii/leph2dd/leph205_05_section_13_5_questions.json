    "correct_answer": "The short-range characteristic of the nuclear force means that nucleons only interact strongly with their immediate neighbors. This limits the number of nucleons a single nucleon can interact with, leading to a saturation effect that causes the binding energy per nucleon to remain nearly constant for medium to heavy nuclei.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The nuclear force is extremely strong compared to both the Coulomb and gravitational forces. While the Coulomb force causes repulsion between protons due to their positive charge, the nuclear force, being orders of magnitude stronger, overcomes this repulsion within the very short range it acts. The gravitational force is negligible at the nuclear scale. Thus, the strong nuclear force binds both protons and neutrons together, maintaining the stability of the nucleus.",
    "explanation": "The nuclear force's strength is roughly many times that of the Coulomb force, making it the dominant force at distances of about 0.8 fm. Its short-range nature means that only nucleons close to one another interact strongly, which leads to the observed saturation of binding energy. In contrast, the gravitational force is extremely weak at the scale of the nucleus and does not contribute significantly to nucleon interactions.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The graph of the potential energy versus separation distance shows a deep well with a minimum around 0.8 fm, indicating the most energetically favorable distance for two nucleons. For separations less than r₀, the potential energy rises steeply due to a strong repulsive force, which prevents nucleons from collapsing into each other. As the separation increases beyond r₀, the potential energy gradually approaches zero, reflecting the limited reach of the force. This shape explains why nucleons bind at a specific distance, leading to nuclear stability.",
    "explanation": "The dip in the graph represents the attractive region of the nuclear force, which peaks at a well-defined equilibrium separation (r₀). The rapid increase in potential energy at shorter distances indicates the repulsive core, which is essential to prevent nucleons from coming too close and destabilizing the nucleus. Finally, the asymptotic approach to zero at larger distances reinforces the idea of a short-range interaction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The charge independence of the nuclear force means that it affects proton-proton, neutron-neutron, and proton-neutron interactions nearly equally. This characteristic is crucial for understanding nuclear structure because it allows neutrons to contribute to the binding energy without adding extra Coulomb repulsion, unlike protons. As a result, nuclei can achieve greater stability and a wider range of neutron-to-proton ratios, which is essential for explaining phenomena such as beta decay and the existence of isotopes.",
    "explanation": "Since the nuclear force does not depend on the electric charge, neutrons, which are electrically neutral, can still interact strongly with protons and other neutrons. This enables the formation of stable nuclei even when the number of neutrons differs from the number of protons. The comparable strength in all nucleon combinations supports the liquid drop model and other nuclear structure theories, highlighting the universal nature of the strong force within the nucleus.",
