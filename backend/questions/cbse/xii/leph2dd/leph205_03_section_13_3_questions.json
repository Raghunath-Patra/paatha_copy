    "correct_answer": "Rutherford’s scattering experiment demonstrated that most alpha particles passed through a thin gold foil with little deflection, but a few were deflected at very large angles.

The distance of closest approach, calculated from the kinetic energy of the alpha particles and the Coulomb repulsive force, provided an upper limit on the size of the nucleus.",
    "explanation": "Rutherford proposed that the atom consists mostly of empty space with a centralized, concentrated nucleus. When alpha particles come close enough to feel the Coulomb repulsion from the positive nucleus, the distance of closest approach is reached, allowing one to infer the maximum size of the nucleus.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Since the nuclear volume is proportional to R^3, and R = R0 * A^(1/3), it follows that the volume is proportional to A. This implies that the number of nucleons per unit volume (i.e., the density) remains constant across different nuclei. The physical implication is that all nuclei, regardless of their size, have essentially the same nucleon packing density, which makes them analogous to droplets of an incompressible fluid.",
    "explanation": "The formula R = R0 * A^(1/3) indicates that as the mass number A increases, the radius increases with A^(1/3), leading the volume (which scales as the cube of the radius) to be directly proportional to A. This linear relationship between volume and mass number implies that the ratio of mass (or number of nucleons) to volume remains constant. This understanding supports the model of the nucleus as a drop of liquid with a constant density, and has significant implications in nuclear physics and astrophysics, such as in modeling neutron stars where matter is compressed to nuclear densities.",

    "correct_answer": "Alpha particles are subject to both Coulomb and nuclear forces, which can complicate the interpretation of scattering at very close distances, while fast electrons interact primarily through Coulomb forces and thus provide a more straightforward probe of the charge distribution and size of the nucleus. Factors affecting accuracy include the projectile energy, the impact of nuclear forces at small distances, and experimental resolution.",
    "explanation": "The use of alpha particles in Rutherford's scattering experiments was foundational but had limitations due to the onset of nuclear force effects at high energies. Fast electrons, being lighter and less susceptible to the strong nuclear force, yield scattering patterns that more accurately reflect the electromagnetic structure of the nucleus. However, both methods require precise measurements of scattering angles and energies. Other factors that can influence the accuracy include target thickness, energy resolution of detectors, and background noise in the experimental setup.",
