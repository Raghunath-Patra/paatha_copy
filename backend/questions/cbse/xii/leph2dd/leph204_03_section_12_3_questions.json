This occurs due to the unique energy level transitions of electrons within the atom. When an atom is excited, electrons move to higher energy levels and then return to lower levels by emitting photons at characteristic wavelengths. By comparing these spectral lines to known standards, one can accurately identify the element or gas present in the sample.",

    "correct_answer": "Electron transitions determine the spectral series observed in hydrogen. In the Lyman series, electrons fall to the n=1 level emitting high-energy (short wavelength) photons in the ultraviolet region. In the Balmer series, electrons transition to n=2, producing visible light wavelengths. In the Paschen series, electrons fall to n=3, resulting in lower energy, longer wavelengths in the infrared region. The lower the final energy level, the greater the energy difference and thus the shorter the wavelength of the emitted photon.",
    "explanation": "This explanation connects the energy levels involved in each series with the photon energy and corresponding wavelength. It clarifies that transitions ending at lower energy levels (such as n=1) yield higher energy, short-wavelength emissions, while transitions ending at higher energy levels yield lower energy, longer-wavelength emissions.",
