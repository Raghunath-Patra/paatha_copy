    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a diode is reverse biased, the width of the depletion layer increases. This expansion occurs because the applied voltage, which is in the same direction as the built-in potential, strengthens the electric field across the junction causing more carriers to be swept away from the junction.",
    "explanation": "The increasing voltage reinforces the separation of charges at the junction, effectively widening the region that is depleted of mobile carriers. This increased depletion width further limits the flow of carriers across the junction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Under forward bias, the p-side of the diode is connected to the positive terminal and the n-side to the negative terminal of a battery. This applied voltage opposes the built-in potential (V₀), thereby reducing the barrier height to (V₀ - V). Consequently, the depletion region narrows, allowing carriers from both sides to cross the junction. Specifically, electrons from the n-side and holes from the p-side are injected into the opposite regions—this minority carrier injection results in a steep concentration gradient that causes diffusion of carriers in both directions. The sum of the diffusion currents of electrons and holes constitutes the forward bias current which increases significantly as the applied voltage increases above a certain threshold.",
    "explanation": "The forward bias reduces the effective barrier potential, enabling carriers with sufficient energy to cross the junction. The rapid increase in current beyond the threshold voltage (typically 0.7 V for silicon diodes) is due to the exponential increase in carrier injection and subsequent diffusion.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In forward bias, the applied voltage decreases the barrier potential (V₀ - V), allowing majority carriers to overcome the junction barrier primarily by diffusion, augmented by minority carrier injection. This results in a large exponential increase in current once the threshold voltage is exceeded. In contrast, under reverse bias, the applied voltage increases the barrier potential (V₀ + V), widening the depletion region and preventing carrier diffusion. Only a small drift current flows, carried by the few minority carriers that exist near the junction. The reverse current remains almost constant until breakdown occurs, at which point it increases sharply.",
    "explanation": "Forward bias enhances carrier injection and diffusion, resulting in high current flow, whereas reverse bias increases the potential barrier, inhibits diffusion, and allows only a limited drift current. The underlying factors include the nature of the depletion region, the change in barrier height, and the dominance of different conduction processes under the two biasing conditions.",

As the applied voltage is varied, the corresponding current is recorded and plotted on a graph. The graph typically shows a slow increase in current up to the threshold voltage (cut-in voltage), followed by an exponential increase in current under forward bias.
