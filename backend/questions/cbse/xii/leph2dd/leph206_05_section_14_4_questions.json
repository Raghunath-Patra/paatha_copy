    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A p-n junction is formed by bringing together p-type and n-type semiconductor regions. Due to the concentration gradient, holes from the p-side diffuse into the n-side and electrons from the n-side diffuse into the p-side. This movement of carriers creates regions of immobile ionized acceptors on the p-side and donors on the n-side, referred to as the space-charge or depletion region. As the region depletes of mobile carriers, an electric field is established opposing further diffusion. This field drives a drift current that counters the diffusion current. Equilibrium is reached when the magnitude of the diffusion current equals that of the drift current, resulting in no net current across the junction.",
    "explanation": "The formation of the p-n junction starts with the diffusion of majority carriers (electrons and holes) across the junction. This carrier movement leaves behind ionized dopant atoms forming the depletion region. The built-in electric field due to these fixed charges generates a drift current which opposes further carrier diffusion. When the drift and diffusion currents balance, the junction reaches equilibrium.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Doping with pentavalent impurities introduces an extra energy level, known as the donor level, slightly below the conduction band (about 0.01 eV for germanium and 0.05 eV for silicon). This allows electrons to be easily excited into the conduction band at room temperature. On the other hand, doping with trivalent impurities creates an acceptor level slightly above the valence band; electrons from the valence band require only a small amount of energy to jump to this level, leaving behind mobile holes. These modifications result in n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively, which have differing Fermi level positions and majority carriers.",
    "explanation": "In n-type semiconductors, donor levels provided by pentavalent dopants lie close to the conduction band, hence requiring minimal energy for electron excitation. In p-type semiconductors, acceptor levels lie near the valence band, leading to an increase in hole concentration. The band diagram thus shifts the effective Fermi level toward the conduction band for n-type and toward the valence band for p-type materials.",
