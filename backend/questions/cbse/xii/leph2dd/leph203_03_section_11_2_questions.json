Photoelectric emission occurs when photons with an energy equal to or greater than the work function strike the metal, transferring their energy to electrons which then escape.",
    "explanation": "This answer requires an integration of concepts: thermionic emission relies on thermal energy, field emission on the quantum tunneling effect due to high electric fields, and photoelectric emission on the energy transfer from photons.
