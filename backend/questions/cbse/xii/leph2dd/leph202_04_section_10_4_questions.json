Using the trigonometric identity cos A + cos B = 2 cos((A + B)/2) cos((A - B)/2), the resultant wave becomes y = 2a cos(φ/2) cos(ωt + φ/2). Since intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude, it follows that I ∝ [2a cos(φ/2)]² = 4a² cos²(φ/2).

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The principle of superposition indicates that the net displacement at any point is the sum of individual wave displacements. With coherent sources, a constant phase relationship yields fixed interference patterns, as seen in ripple tank experiments. In contrast, incoherent sources result in rapidly changing phase differences and a time-averaged intensity distribution, leading to a loss of distinct interference fringes.",
    "explanation": "The stable interference patterns observed in ripple tank experiments are a direct consequence of the constant phase difference between coherent sources. These experiments show clear bright and dark fringes where constructive or destructive interference occurs. Conversely, when the sources are incoherent, the interference pattern fluctuates and only a smooth overall intensity can be detected on the screen. This demonstrates how coherence is crucial for well-defined interference phenomena.",
