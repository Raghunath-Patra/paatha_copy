    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Radioactive decay arises from an unstable nucleus seeking a lower energy state, resulting in the emission of radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma photons. In contrast, phosphorescence involves the absorption of energy by electrons which then re-emit light over time as they return to lower energy states. The key difference is that radioactive decay is a nuclear process involving the nucleus, while phosphorescence is an electronic process involving electron transitions in atoms or molecules.",
    "explanation": "The instability in radioactive nuclei leads to decay processes that are governed by nuclear forces and energy considerations, whereas phosphorescence results from excited electronic states in a material. Radioactive decay emits particles or high-energy photons directly from the nucleus, making it fundamentally different from phosphorescence, which is related to delayed light emission due to electronic transitions.",

    "correct_answer": "Becquerel's experimental design involved exposing a uranium compound to light, then shielding it with black paper while placing a piece of silver between the compound and a photographic plate. The subsequent blackening of the plate revealed that the emitted radiation was capable of penetrating both the paper and the silver. This design effectively demonstrated that the radiation was not typical of light or heat, but a more penetrating and unusual type of emission, indicating a nuclear phenomenon.",
    "explanation": "The use of materials such as black paper and silver, which are normally effective at blocking light, highlighted the extraordinary penetrating power of the radiation. This innovative design provided clear evidence that the source of the blackening was not simply an optical effect but was due to a form of radiation that could traverse solid barriers.",

    "correct_answer": "A modern experiment could use a combination of semiconductor detectors and scintillation counters to detect and differentiate between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. The setup would include a vacuum chamber housing the radioactive sample, surrounded by detectors at various angles. Energy spectra would be recorded using a multi-channel analyzer for gamma rays and specialized detectors for charged particles. Data collected would include count rates, energy distributions, and angular dispersion of the emissions, allowing characterization of the decay modes and energy release in each event.",

By using semiconductor detectors, which have excellent energy resolution, and scintillation counters for high-speed detection, the experiment would provide detailed quantitative data about the decay processes.
