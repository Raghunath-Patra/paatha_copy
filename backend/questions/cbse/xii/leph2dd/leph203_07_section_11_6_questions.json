    "explanation": "Einstein's framework resolved the puzzling observations from experiments: (i) The kinetic energy of ejected electrons increases with frequency, not intensity; (ii) A minimum frequency (threshold frequency) is necessary for emission; (iii) The photoemission process is nearly instantaneous.
