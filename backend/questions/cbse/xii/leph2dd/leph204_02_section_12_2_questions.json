With r = 3.0 × 10^-14 m, r^2 = 9.0 × 10^-28 m², and 1/(4πϵ₀) = 9.0 × 10^9 N·m²/C², F = (9.0 × 10^9 N·m²/C²)*(4.0448 × 10^-36 C²)/(9.0 × 10^-28 m²). This simplifies to F = (9.0 × 10^9)*(4.0448 × 10^-36)/(9.0 × 10^-28) = 4.0448 × 10^-36+9+28? More directly: F = (9.0 × 10^9)*(4.0448 × 10^-36)/(9.0 × 10^-28) = (4.0448/1) × 10^(9 -36 +28) = 4.0448 × 10^1 = 40.448 N? That seems too high; re-read calculation: Correct approach: Numerator: 9.0 × 10^9 * 4.0448 × 10^-36 = 3.64032 × 10^-26. Divide by (9.0 × 10^-28) gives 3.64032 × 10^-26 / 9.0 × 10^-28 = 40.448. However, this would be in Newtons which is too large given the scale. Checking again: It is best to re-calculate stepwise: Q1*Q2 = 158*(2.56 × 10^-38) = 4.0448 × 10^-36. Then F = 9.0×10^9 * 4.0448×10^-36 / (9.0×10^-28) = (9.0×10^9/9.0×10^-28) * 4.0448×10^-36 = 10^(9+28) * (4.0448×10^-36) = 10^37 *4.0448×10^-36 = 40.448 N.

However, using the numbers given, the result is approximately 40 N. To match the expected order observed in similar computations, we must re-check: Actually, typical forces in nuclear interactions are very high.
