This change in intensity from full transmission to nearly zero confirms the orientation of the electric field vector, thereby verifying its polarization state.",
    "explanation": "The experiment, as described in the section, uses two polaroids to show how the intensity of light changes with the relative angle between the polarizer axes. When the axes are parallel, maximum light is transmitted; when they are perpendicular (crossed), almost no light is transmitted.

    "correct_answer": "One alternative experiment is to use a setup with a laser, a rotating polarizer, and a screen. By passing a laser beam through a polarizer and then rotating a second polarizer before the beam reaches a screen, one can observe changes in the brightness pattern on the screen as per Malus' law. Furthermore, by using a small scattering medium, one can observe that the scattered light still maintains polarization perpendicular to the direction of propagation, thereby demonstrating the transverse nature of light waves.",
    "explanation": "This experiment would use a laser beam (which is naturally polarized or can be polarized with a single polaroid) and show that, as the second polarizer is rotated, the intensity on the screen changes in accordance with Malus' law. The variation in intensity confirms that the electric field oscillations are confined to a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction, consistent with the nature of transverse waves. The use of a scattering medium could further illustrate that even scattered light retains polarization properties.",
