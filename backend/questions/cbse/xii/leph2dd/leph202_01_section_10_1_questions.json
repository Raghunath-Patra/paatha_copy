Thomas Young's interference experiments provided strong evidence for the wave nature of light. Subsequent experiments on diffraction and interference reinforced this view. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory further advanced the understanding by showing that light is an electromagnetic wave that can propagate through vacuum, resolving the issue of the need for a propagation medium.",

    "correct_answer": "Huygens principle considers every point on a wavefront as a source of secondary spherical wavelets. The new wavefront is the tangent to all these secondary wavelets. For reflection, the construction shows that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection because the wavelets propagate symmetrically across the interface. For refraction, by constructing wavelets in the second medium with a different speed, the new wavefront is tilted relative to the normal, leading to Snell's law. The assumption that the medium changes the speed of the wave is crucial in deriving refraction.",
    "explanation": "Using Huygens principle, one can visualize the transition of a wavefront at an interface. By drawing secondary wavelets and their tangent, the geometric construction naturally leads to the laws of reflection (equal angles) and refraction (bending determined by speed differences).
