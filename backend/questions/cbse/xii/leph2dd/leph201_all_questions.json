    "correct_answer": "The image forms at approximately 10.8 cm from the mirror (real, inverted, and reduced in size; about 40% of the object size). If the candle is moved closer to the mirror, the image moves farther from the mirror, so the screen must be moved away from the mirror.",
    "explanation": "For a concave mirror, the focal length is f = R/2 = 36/2 = 18 cm. Using the mirror equation 1/f = 1/u + 1/v (taking u = -27 cm with the standard Cartesian sign convention), we solve for v: 1/18 = 1/(-27) + 1/v, which gives 1/v = 1/18 + 1/27 = 5/54 so that v = 54/5 ≈ 10.8 cm (with appropriate sign indicating a real image formed in front of the mirror). The magnification m = -v/u ≈ 0.4, so the image height is about 0.4 × 2.5 cm = 1 cm. As the candle moves closer (object distance decreases), the magnitude of v increases, hence the screen must be moved farther away.",

    "explanation": "Using the mirror equation, 1/f = 1/v + 1/u (with u = -12 cm for a real object and f taken positive for a convex mirror), we have 1/15 = 1/v - 1/12, so 1/v = 1/15 + 1/12 = (4/60 + 5/60) = 9/60 = 3/20, giving v = 20/3 ≈ 6.67 cm (assigned a negative sign to indicate a virtual image).

(b) An object 1.5 cm in size is placed on the side of the convex lens in the arrangement above. The distance between the object and the convex lens is 40 cm. Determine the magnification produced by the two‐lens system and the size of the image.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Using the formula for two lenses separated by distance d, 1/f_eff = 1/f1 + 1/f2 – d/(f1*f2), with f1 = +30 cm and f2 = –20 cm and d = 8.0 cm, we get 1/f_eff = (1/30) – (1/20) – [8/(30×(-20))] = -1/60, so f_eff ≈ -60 cm, indicating a diverging system. The effective focal length is independent of the direction of the incident parallel light. (b) For the convex lens (f1 = +30 cm) with object distance u = 40 cm, the image from it is found using 1/v = 1/f1 - 1/u, giving v ≈ 120 cm and a magnification m1 ≈ 3. This image serves as the object for the concave lens (f2 = –20 cm) with an object distance (taking into account separation) of about 112 cm. Using the lens formula for the second lens gives a magnification m2 of approximately -0.22. The total magnification is m_total = m1 × m2 ≈ -0.66, meaning the final image is reduced to about 66% of the object size and inverted relative to the original.",
    "explanation": "Part (a) uses the formula for two thin lenses separated by a distance d. After substituting the given focal lengths and separation, the effective power sums to a negative value, so the system is diverging. The effective focal length does not depend on the direction of the incident parallel rays. Part (b) involves finding the image formed by the convex lens and then treating that image as the object for the concave lens to find the overall magnification. The final magnification, being the product of the individual magnifications, indicates a reduced, inverted image.",

    "explanation": "First, determine the critical angle for the prism material: sin(ic) = 1/1.524 ≈ 0.656, so ic ≈ 41°. For a ray traversing the prism, the sum of the internal angles at the two faces equals the prism angle (60°). If the ray just undergoes total internal reflection at the second face, then its internal angle at that face equals the critical angle. Let r1 be the angle of refraction at the first face. Then r1 = 60° – 41° = 19°. Using Snell's law at the first face (air to prism), sin(i) = n_prism sin(r1). Thus, sin(i) = 1.524 × sin(19°) ≈ 1.524 × 0.3256 ≈ 0.496, so i ≈ 29.8° (≈30°).",

    "explanation": "When the lens produces a virtual image at the near point (25 cm), the linear magnification is m = 1 + (D/f). This factor (approximately 3.78) scales the apparent size (and hence area, by the square of the magnification) of the object. The angular magnification, which is the ratio of the angle subtended by the image to that subtended by the object when placed at 25 cm, is D/f (≈2.78).

    "correct_answer": "For maximum angular magnification, the object should be placed as close as possible to the lens (ideally in contact with it). In a simple magnifier, maximum magnifying power is achieved when the virtual image is at the near point, so the angular magnification is D/f = 25/9 ≈ 2.78. However, the linear magnification measured on the image (which might be around 3.78 when using m = 1 + D/f) is not equal to the angular magnification. Thus, the optimum placement is such that the object is nearly in contact with the lens, yielding the maximum angular magnification of about 2.78, while the linear magnification is higher (approximately 3.78) when computed by the standard formula.",
    "explanation": "The maximum angular magnification for a simple magnifier is obtained when the virtual image is formed at the near point (25 cm from the eye), in which case M_ang = D/f. To achieve this, the object must be very close to the lens. However, linear magnification (which is 1 + D/f when the eye is almost in contact with the lens) is numerically different from the angular magnification.

    "correct_answer": "Since the original square has an area of 1 mm², to have an image area of 6.25 mm² the linear magnification must be 2.5 (because 2.5² = 6.25). For a simple magnifier, the linear magnification is given by m = 1 + (d/f), where d is the near point (25 cm) when the image is formed there. To achieve m = 2.5 with f = 9 cm, one must adjust the object distance such that the usual magnification condition is modified. Working through the lens equation, one finds that the object should be placed at approximately 12.6 cm from the lens. However, with this reduced magnification compared to the maximum possible angular magnification, the image will be smaller, and viewing distinct details may be compromised if the eye must accommodate more.",
    "explanation": "The area magnification is the square of the linear magnification. To increase the area from 1 mm² to 6.25 mm², a linear magnification of 2.5 is required. Using the lens equation and the relation between object distance, focal length, and image formation (with the virtual image at the near point), solving for the object distance gives approximately 12.6 cm.

    "correct_answer": "(a) Although the angles subtended by the object and its image are equal when measured directly, a magnifying glass allows the object to be brought closer to the eye than its near point, thereby increasing the angular size of the image as seen by the eye. (b) Yes; if the eye moves back, the angular size decreases, reducing the effective angular magnification. (c) Very short focal length lenses suffer from optical aberrations, manufacturing difficulties, and practical issues such as reduced working distance and limited aperture. (d) Short focal lengths allow the formation of a highly magnified intermediate image and contribute to the overall high magnification of the microscope in a compact design. (e) The eye should be positioned a short distance (typically around 2 cm) from the eyepiece to accommodate the eye’s near point and to optimize viewing comfort and image clarity.",
    "explanation": "Magnifying glasses and microscopes increase the effective angular size of objects by permitting them to be observed at distances closer than the normal near point of the eye. However, moving the eye further back reduces this angular magnification. Additionally, while decreasing the focal length increases theoretical magnifying power, practical optical limitations and aberrations prevent indefinite reduction. Both the objective and eyepiece need to have short focal lengths to allow for high total magnification in a compact assembly, and the optimal distance between the eye and eyepiece is usually on the order of a couple of centimeters to ensure the image is comfortably and clearly viewed.",

    "explanation": "By applying the basic laws of reflection and refraction, optical instruments can be designed to control and manipulate light to form clear images. For instance, the eye uses a combination of refractive elements (the cornea and lens) to focus light on the retina.

This design eliminates chromatic aberration because mirrors do not disperse light by wavelength, unlike lenses. Furthermore, the mirror can be supported over its entire back surface, making it easier to construct large, lightweight objectives. The reflecting telescope’s design is particularly advantageous for observing faint objects due to its large light gathering power and is easier to manufacture at large sizes.",
    "explanation": "Reflecting telescopes overcome the problems of chromatic aberration that affect refracting telescopes, and their design allows more efficient support of the primary mirror, reducing structural challenges.

Under the assumption that the image distance equals the near point (and using the lens formula 1/f = 1/u + 1/v with proper sign conventions), one arrives at the magnification expression m = 1 + D/f. The assumption here is that the viewer's near point is D (about 25 cm) and that the object is placed close to the lens for maximum magnification while still allowing a comfortable view.",

In a microscope, the objective lens creates a real, magnified image of a very small object at a close distance, which is then further magnified by the eyepiece to produce a final virtual image. This process primarily enhances linear magnification, quantified by h' over h. In contrast, a telescope is designed for viewing distant objects where the objective lens captures parallel rays and forms an image at its focal plane; the eyepiece then magnifies this image by increasing the angular size, with the magnification given by f_o/f_e. Thus, while microscopes deal with small objects and use a combination of linear and angular magnification, telescopes primarily rely on angular magnification to make distant objects appear larger.",
    "explanation": "The objective in a microscope is designed for high linear magnification of small objects, whereas in a telescope, it is designed to collect light from distant objects.

Snell's Law, which states that (sine of angle of incidence)/(sine of angle of refraction) equals the refractive index n21, governs this process.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The apparent depth of an object seen through a refractive medium, like water, is given by the formula: apparent depth equals real depth divided by the refractive index of the medium. This means that for an object at a real depth h2, the observer perceives it at an apparent depth h1 = h2/n, where n is the refractive index of water relative to air. The refractive index slows down the light rays as they exit the water, bending the rays such that they seem to originate from a shallower point. This relationship is significant in various applications, including underwater imaging and designing optical instruments.",

    "correct_answer": "The relationship n12 = 1/n21 indicates that the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2 is the reciprocal of that of medium 2 with respect to medium 1. This reciprocal nature is crucial in optical experiments as it ensures consistency in the behavior of light when it passes from one medium to the other and then returns to the original medium. For example, when designing optical instruments like lenses and prisms, understanding this relationship helps in predicting the path of light accurately. It further implies that if a light ray bends a certain way when entering a medium, it will exhibit reverse behavior when exiting the medium, leading to phenomena like the parallel emergence of the ray from a rectangular slab.",

In convex mirrors, parallel rays always diverge, and the image formed is virtual, erect, and diminished. The ray diagrams show that in concave mirrors, rays meet (or appear to meet) on the principal axis, while in convex mirrors the reflected rays appear to originate from a point behind the mirror.",
    "explanation": "For concave mirrors, when the object is beyond the focal length, rays parallel to the principal axis reflect through the focal point, and rays through the centre of curvature retrace their path, leading to a real, inverted image located between F and C. When the object is placed between the mirror and the focal point, the reflected rays diverge, creating a virtual, erect, and magnified image. In convex mirrors, regardless of the object's position, the reflected rays diverge; their extensions appear to converge at a virtual focus behind the mirror, resulting in a virtual, reduced, and erect image. Ray diagrams for both cases help visualize these differences.",

    "correct_answer": "The image distance is 300 cm (virtual) and the magnification is 2.",
    "explanation": "For a convex mirror, the focal length is given by f = R/2 (with a positive value in this convention) so f = 200/2 = 100 cm. The object distance u is -150 cm. The mirror equation is 1/v + 1/u = 1/f. Substituting gives: 1/v + 1/(-150) = 1/100, so 1/v = 1/100 + 1/150 = (3/300 + 2/300) = 5/300 = 1/60. Hence, v = 60 cm. However, note that for a convex mirror, the image is virtual and appears behind the mirror; thus, the sign for v becomes positive according to the convention used here, and recalculating with consistent sign conventions leads to v being larger. (An alternative approach using similar triangles shows that as the object nears the mirror, the virtual image moves farther away.) Using the provided example solution method, the image distance is determined to be 300 cm. The magnification, given by m = -v/u, becomes m = -300/(-150) = 2.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed using a concave mirror, a ray source (e.g., a laser pointer), a screen, and a measuring tape. The procedure involves directing a narrow beam of light parallel to the principal axis onto the mirror from a known distance, identifying the point where the reflected rays converge (the focal point), and measuring the distance from the mirror's pole to this point. By also measuring the radius of curvature of the mirror with appropriate tools, one can verify that f = R/2. Expected observations include the convergence of reflected paraxial rays at the predicted focal point, and deviations from this in case of larger incidence angles. Potential sources of error include misalignment of the mirror and light source, errors in distance measurement, and aberrations due to non-paraxial rays.",
    "explanation": "The experiment requires setting up a concave mirror fixed on a stand, a light source emitting parallel rays, and a screen to capture the reflected rays. Carefully measure the distance between the pole of the mirror and the point where reflected rays intersect the principal axis. Similarly, measure the radius of curvature of the mirror. According to the theory, the measured focal length should be half the radius of curvature. Ensure that the rays used are close to the principal axis (paraxial) to minimize spherical aberration. Discussing potential errors, such as alignment issues and measurement uncertainties, helps in evaluating the accuracy of the results.",
