    "question_text": "Compute the magnitude of the electrostatic repulsive force between an alpha particle (charge 2e) and a gold nucleus (charge 79e) when they are separated by a distance of 3.0 × 10^-14 m. (Use e = 1.6 × 10^-19 C and 1/(4πϵ₀) = 9.0 × 10^9 N·m²/C².)",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 1.93 × 10^-8 N",
    "explanation": "The electrostatic force is given by F = [1/(4πϵ₀)]*(Q1*Q2)/r^2. Here, Q1 = 2e and Q2 = 79e, so Q1*Q2 = 2×79×(1.6 × 10^-19)^2 = 158×(2.56 × 10^-38) = 4.0448 × 10^-36 C². With r = 3.0 × 10^-14 m, r^2 = 9.0 × 10^-28 m², and 1/(4πϵ₀) = 9.0 × 10^9 N·m²/C², F = (9.0 × 10^9 N·m²/C²)*(4.0448 × 10^-36 C²)/(9.0 × 10^-28 m²). This simplifies to F = (9.0 × 10^9)*(4.0448 × 10^-36)/(9.0 × 10^-28) = 4.0448 × 10^-36+9+28? More directly: F = (9.0 × 10^9)*(4.0448 × 10^-36)/(9.0 × 10^-28) = (4.0448/1) × 10^(9 -36 +28) = 4.0448 × 10^1 = 40.448 N? That seems too high; re-read calculation: Correct approach: Numerator: 9.0 × 10^9 * 4.0448 × 10^-36 = 3.64032 × 10^-26. Divide by (9.0 × 10^-28) gives 3.64032 × 10^-26 / 9.0 × 10^-28 = 40.448. However, this would be in Newtons which is too large given the scale. Checking again: It is best to re-calculate stepwise: Q1*Q2 = 158*(2.56 × 10^-38) = 4.0448 × 10^-36. Then F = 9.0×10^9 * 4.0448×10^-36 / (9.0×10^-28) = (9.0×10^9/9.0×10^-28) * 4.0448×10^-36 = 10^(9+28) * (4.0448×10^-36) = 10^37 *4.0448×10^-36 = 40.448 N. This large value suggests a very strong force at a very short distance, but note that in practice the alpha particle never actually touches the nucleus. However, using the numbers given, the result is approximately 40 N. To match the expected order observed in similar computations, we must re-check: Actually, typical forces in nuclear interactions are very high. Given the parameters, the computed force is approximately 40 N. Thus, the correct answer is approximately 40 N.",

    "correct_answer": "Rutherford deduced that since only a very small fraction of alpha particles were deflected by large angles, the positive charge responsible for the deflection must be confined to a very small region, thus placing an upper limit on the size of the nucleus. Assumptions include that alpha particles suffer at most one scattering event in the thin foil, that the nucleus remains stationary, and that Coulomb’s law fully describes the interaction. The use of energy conservation in determining the distance of closest approach also presumes that the alpha particle does not physically contact the nucleus.",
    "explanation": "By analyzing the fraction of alpha particles deflected at various angles, Rutherford reasoned that a large repulsive force was only possible if the charge was concentrated in a very small volume. His analysis used key assumptions such as a single scattering event, a stationary heavy nucleus, and the applicability of classical Coulomb’s law.

Using the quantized angular momentum condition allows solving for the radius and velocity in terms of n.

    "correct_answer": "When an electron in the hydrogen atom transitions from a higher energy state (with quantum number n_i) to a lower energy state (with quantum number n_f), the difference in energy is released as a photon. This process is described by the equation hv = E_ni - E_nf. Since both n_i and n_f are integers, this produces photons with discrete energies, which are observed as distinct emission lines in the spectrum.",
    "explanation": "The process involves an electron losing energy by dropping to a lower energy level. The energy lost (E_ni - E_nf) is carried away by a photon, whose frequency is given by v = (E_ni - E_nf) / h.

    "correct_answer": "Approximately 6.1 x 10^-15 meters",
    "explanation": "First, calculate e^2 = (1.6 x 10^-19)^2 = 2.56 x 10^-38 C^2. The numerator: k Z1 Z2 e^2 = 8.99 x 10^9 x 2 x 79 x 2.56 x 10^-38. Multiplying 2 x 79 = 158, then 8.99 x 10^9 x 158 ≈ 1.42 x 10^12; multiplying by 2.56 x 10^-38 gives approximately 3.6352 x 10^-26 N·m^2. Denominator: 2 E = 2 x 5 x 1.602 x 10^-13 = 1.602 x 10^-12 J. Therefore, b = (3.6352 x 10^-26 / 1.602 x 10^-12) x 0.2679 ≈ (2.27 x 10^-14) x 0.2679 ≈ 6.1 x 10^-15 m.",
