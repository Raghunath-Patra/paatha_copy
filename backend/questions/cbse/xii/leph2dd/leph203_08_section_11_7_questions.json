    "correct_answer": "The photoelectric effect demonstrated that light interacts with matter in discrete packets, or quanta, each with energy E = hv. Einstein proposed that these quanta, later called photons, carry momentum p = hv/c. This particle-like behavior was necessary to explain phenomena such as the immediate ejection of electrons when light of sufficient frequency was incident on a metal surface, and it was later confirmed by experiments like the Compton scattering experiment. Overall, the distinct energy and momentum properties provided strong evidence that light behaves as particles.",
    "explanation": "The realization that light can behave as both a wave and a particle was a major milestone in quantum physics. The photoelectric effect challenged the classical wave theory by showing that light must be quantized, leading to the concept of the photon. Its ability to carry specific amounts of energy and momentum, independent of intensity, was crucial in establishing the dual nature of light.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Einstein's photoelectric equation, eV₀ = hv - φ₀, clearly shows that the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the frequency (v) of the incident light and not on its intensity. This finding supports the quantum view of light, where each photon has a fixed energy (hv). Changing the intensity of the light alters the number of photons striking the metal, but does not change the energy of individual photons. Therefore, only light with a frequency above a threshold (determined by the work function φ₀) can eject electrons.",
    "explanation": "The equation exemplifies one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics by separating the concepts of energy per photon and the photon flux.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Compton scattering experiment demonstrated that when X-rays collide with electrons, the scattered X-rays have longer wavelengths. This change in wavelength could only be explained if the X-rays were treated as particles (photons) that carry momentum. By applying the conservation of energy and momentum to the collision between the photon and an electron, the observed shift in wavelength (Compton shift) was accurately predicted. This result provided strong evidence that light exhibits particle-like properties.",
    "explanation": "The experiment relied on the principle that both energy and momentum must be conserved in collisions. When a photon collides with an electron, part of the photon's energy is transferred to the electron, resulting in a reduction in the photon's energy and an increase in its wavelength. The quantitative agreement between the observed and predicted wavelength changes confirmed the particle theory of light and underscored the significance of conservation laws in understanding quantum phenomena.",
