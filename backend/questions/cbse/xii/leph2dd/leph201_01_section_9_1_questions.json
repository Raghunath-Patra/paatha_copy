    "correct_answer": "The light ray concept is an approximation that is valid when the wavelength of light is negligibly small compared to the dimensions of the objects it interacts with. In such cases, wave phenomena like diffraction and interference are minimized, allowing light waves to be represented as straight line segments or rays. This simplification allows us to apply geometric optics to analyze reflection, refraction, and image formation.",
    "explanation": "Although light is fundamentally an electromagnetic wave, its wavelength (on the order of hundreds of nanometers) is very small relative to everyday objects (on the order of centimeters or more). This size difference means that complex wave effects do not dominate most visual interactions, and the light can be modeled as a ray, simplifying analysis while still accurately describing phenomena such as reflection and refraction.",

    "explanation": "Our perception of the environment is based on light that carries information about object color, shape, and position. The retina's sensitivity to specific wavelengths allows us to see, and the subsequent image processing by the brain enables recognition and interpretation.

    "correct_answer": "Reflection, refraction, and dispersion are fundamental optical phenomena that allow for the formation of images. Reflection enables image formation in mirrors and some telescopes, refraction is key in lenses to focus light (as seen in the human eye and cameras), and dispersion explains how white light splits into different colors, informing the design of instruments like spectrometers.",
    "explanation": "By applying the basic laws of reflection and refraction, optical instruments can be designed to control and manipulate light to form clear images. For instance, the eye uses a combination of refractive elements (the cornea and lens) to focus light on the retina. Dispersion further plays a role in refracting light at slightly different angles depending on wavelength, an effect that must be managed in high-precision optical devices. Evaluating these phenomena helps in understanding both natural and artificial systems that rely on light.",
