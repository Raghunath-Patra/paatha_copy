    "correct_answer": "The dual nature of light is demonstrated through experiments that show both wave-like and particle-like behavior. Interference, diffraction, and polarization effects are well explained by the wave theory, where light exhibits properties such as wavelength and frequency. On the other hand, phenomena like the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering, which involve quantized energy and momentum transfer, require the photon picture of light. The appropriate description depends on the experiment: the wave description is used to explain how light is focused (e.g., in the eye lens), while the photon description explains how light is absorbed (e.g., by the retina).",
    "explanation": "This answer examines the dual nature of light by giving examples of experiments favoring each description. Wave properties are evident from interference and diffraction experiments, whereas the energy quanta observed in the photoelectric and Compton effects necessitate a particle description.

The proposal also provided experimental predictions, such as electron diffraction, that were later confirmed, solidifying the dual nature of matter.",

For typical macroscopic objects, the resulting wavelength is exceedingly small, far below the limits of current detection technology. Environmental disturbances, quantum decoherence, and the precision required in measurement apparatus would further complicate the experiment.",
    "explanation": "The de Broglie wavelength for macroscopic objects is practically negligible due to high mass and speed, yielding values many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic scale. In addition, interference effects, which are key to detecting wave properties, become undetectable due to decoherence and instrumental limitations.
