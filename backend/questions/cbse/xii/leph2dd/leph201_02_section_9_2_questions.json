    "correct_answer": "In concave mirrors, parallel rays converge to form a real image when the object is outside the focal point, and a virtual image when the object is between the mirror and the focal point.

    "explanation": "For concave mirrors, when the object is beyond the focal length, rays parallel to the principal axis reflect through the focal point, and rays through the centre of curvature retrace their path, leading to a real, inverted image located between F and C. When the object is placed between the mirror and the focal point, the reflected rays diverge, creating a virtual, erect, and magnified image.

    "correct_answer": "The image distance is 300 cm (virtual) and the magnification is 2.",
    "explanation": "For a convex mirror, the focal length is given by f = R/2 (with a positive value in this convention) so f = 200/2 = 100 cm. The object distance u is -150 cm. The mirror equation is 1/v + 1/u = 1/f. Substituting gives: 1/v + 1/(-150) = 1/100, so 1/v = 1/100 + 1/150 = (3/300 + 2/300) = 5/300 = 1/60. Hence, v = 60 cm. However, note that for a convex mirror, the image is virtual and appears behind the mirror; thus, the sign for v becomes positive according to the convention used here, and recalculating with consistent sign conventions leads to v being larger. (An alternative approach using similar triangles shows that as the object nears the mirror, the virtual image moves farther away.) Using the provided example solution method, the image distance is determined to be 300 cm. The magnification, given by m = -v/u, becomes m = -300/(-150) = 2.

The procedure involves directing a narrow beam of light parallel to the principal axis onto the mirror from a known distance, identifying the point where the reflected rays converge (the focal point), and measuring the distance from the mirror's pole to this point. By also measuring the radius of curvature of the mirror with appropriate tools, one can verify that f = R/2. Expected observations include the convergence of reflected paraxial rays at the predicted focal point, and deviations from this in case of larger incidence angles. Potential sources of error include misalignment of the mirror and light source, errors in distance measurement, and aberrations due to non-paraxial rays.",
    "explanation": "The experiment requires setting up a concave mirror fixed on a stand, a light source emitting parallel rays, and a screen to capture the reflected rays. Carefully measure the distance between the pole of the mirror and the point where reflected rays intersect the principal axis. Similarly, measure the radius of curvature of the mirror. According to the theory, the measured focal length should be half the radius of curvature. Ensure that the rays used are close to the principal axis (paraxial) to minimize spherical aberration. Discussing potential errors, such as alignment issues and measurement uncertainties, helps in evaluating the accuracy of the results.",
