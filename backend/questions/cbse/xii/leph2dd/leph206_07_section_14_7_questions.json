    "correct_answer": "A half-wave rectifier uses one diode to pass only one half-cycle of the AC input, resulting in a pulsating dc output with large gaps and lower average voltage. In contrast, a full-wave rectifier, typically using a centre-tap transformer and two diodes (or an arrangement with four diodes), rectifies both half-cycles of the AC input, providing a higher average output voltage and a smoother pulsating waveform. The full-wave rectifier is more efficient as it utilizes the entire AC waveform.",
    "explanation": "The half-wave rectifier's simplicity allows it to conduct for only one half-cycle, resulting in significant power loss and a lower average DC output, necessitating more filtering for stable operation. The full-wave rectifier, by rectifying both halves of the AC cycle, provides a waveform with a higher duty cycle and efficiency. The full-wave configuration also requires a centre-tap transformer (or an alternative set of diodes) to produce the needed polarity inversion during the negative half-cycle, which leads to a more continuous rectified output.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a centre-tap full-wave rectifier, the secondary winding of the transformer has a centre tap that serves as the reference or ground. During the positive half-cycle, one end of the secondary becomes positive relative to the centre tap causing the corresponding diode to be forward biased and conduct, while the other diode is reverse biased. In the negative half-cycle, the roles reverse, and the other diode conducts. This alternating conduction results in both half-cycles contributing to the output, which is taken between the common junction of the diodes and the centre tap, yielding a full-wave rectified pulsating dc voltage.",
    "explanation": "The centre-tap transformer provides two equal but opposite AC voltages. Each diode conducts alternately depending on the polarity of its connected terminal. The conduction during both half-cycles ensures that the entire input waveform is utilized, doubling the frequency of the rectified output compared to a half-wave rectifier and providing a higher average dc voltage with less ripple, especially when filtered.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A capacitor filter charges up to the peak voltage of the rectified waveform and discharges slowly through the load during the non-conducting phase, reducing the ac ripple in the output. This results in a smoother dc voltage that is closer to the peak value. To further improve the purity of the dc output, additional filtering stages using an inductor or a combination of capacitor and resistor (RC filter) can be employed, or a voltage regulator can be added to stabilize the output.",
    "explanation": "The effectiveness of a capacitor filter is determined by its ability to maintain a voltage close to the peak value between conduction intervals. A larger capacitance and higher load resistance increase the time constant, which minimizes the voltage drop between peaks. However, if the load current is high, the discharge may be significant, and additional filtering of the residual ripple may be necessary. Alternative designs such as LC filters or active voltage regulators offer improved performance by further smoothing the output, which is particularly important in sensitive electronic applications.",
