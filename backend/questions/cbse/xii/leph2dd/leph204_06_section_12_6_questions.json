For a stable orbit, an integer number of wavelengths must fit into the orbit's circumference, i.e., 2π r_n = nλ. Substituting the de Broglie relation leads to m v_n r_n = n h/2π. This quantization condition restricts the electron to specific orbits with definite radii and energy levels. The discrete energy levels arise because only certain orbits can sustain standing waves, thereby causing the electron transitions to occur between these well-defined states.",
    "explanation": "By treating the electron as a wave, the resonance requirement for standing waves naturally leads to quantized angular momentum, which in turn gives rise to discrete energy levels.

It uses the classical idea of electrons moving in circular orbits and does not offer an explanation for many observed atomic phenomena. Modern quantum mechanics, by contrast, treats electrons as wave functions that follow the probabilistic Schrödinger equation, which provides a more complete and accurate description of atomic structure. It incorporates the possibility of multiple electron interactions and offers a natural explanation for energy levels, spectral intensities, and the observed chemical properties of atoms.",

    "correct_answer": "Imagine a circular racetrack where a car (representing an electron) must have exactly an integer number of rubber bands wrapped around its circular track to be stable. If the number of rubber bands does not fit exactly, the track becomes unstable and the car loses traction. This mirrors de Broglie's idea that electrons behave as waves, where only those orbits that accommodate an integer number of wavelengths form stable standing waves, leading to quantized orbits.",
    "explanation": "The thought experiment uses a familiar analogy where the stability of the system (the racetrack) depends on a resonance condition (exact number of rubber bands), which is directly analogous to the quantum condition in electron orbits.
