    "correct_answer": "Electrode potentials are measured by constructing a galvanic cell in which one half-cell is the electrode in question and the other is the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), whose potential is set at zero. The measured emf of the cell equals the difference between the electrode potential and the SHE. This method provides a standardized way to determine the reduction potentials of various half-cells.",
    "explanation": "Since the direct measurement of individual electrode potentials is not possible, the SHE is used as a reference. By connecting the electrode of interest with the SHE under standard conditions (H2 gas at 1 bar, H⁺ at 1 M), the emf measured corresponds directly to the standard electrode potential of the other half-cell. This approach leverages the convention that SHE has zero potential, thereby simplifying calculations in electrochemistry.",

    "correct_answer": "In a galvanic cell, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through the external circuit. However, the conventional current direction is defined as flowing from the cathode to the anode, which is opposite to the electron flow. This difference arises because the conventional current is defined based on the movement of positive charge.",
    "explanation": "The actual charge carriers in a galvanic cell are electrons, which carry a negative charge, moving from the anode to the cathode. However, by historical convention, current is assumed to flow in the opposite direction, as if positive charges were moving. This explanation highlights the significance of understanding the roles of both electrons and conventional current in electrochemical processes.",
