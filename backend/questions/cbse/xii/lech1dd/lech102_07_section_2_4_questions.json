    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For strong electrolytes, molar conductivity increases slowly with dilution because they are fully dissociated; the increase is mainly due to the increased volume of solution per mole of electrolyte. In contrast, for weak electrolytes, dilution causes a significant increase in molar conductivity because the degree of dissociation increases with dilution, leading to more ions per mole. At infinite dilution, weak electrolytes become fully dissociated, but the rise in molar conductivity with dilution is much steeper compared to strong electrolytes.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that while strong electrolytes show a modest increase in molar conductivity upon dilution (often represented linearly versus the square root of concentration), weak electrolytes exhibit a sharper increase due to the additional effect of increasing dissociation, which is quantified by the degree of dissociation (α).",
