    "correct_answer": "The Daniell cell consists of two half-cells; zinc serves as the anode where oxidation occurs (Zn is oxidized to Zn²⁺, losing electrons) and copper serves as the cathode where reduction takes place (Cu²⁺ is reduced to Cu by gaining electrons). The flow of electrons from the zinc electrode to the copper electrode through an external circuit converts the chemical energy from the redox reaction into electrical energy.",
    "explanation": "In this cell, zinc’s oxidation releases electrons that travel through the circuit to the copper cathode, where Cu²⁺ ions accept the electrons, forming copper metal.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A galvanic cell operates spontaneously, converting chemical energy to electrical energy, while an electrolytic cell requires external energy to drive a non-spontaneous reaction. When an external potential equal to the cell's intrinsic voltage (1.1 V) is applied to a galvanic cell, the reaction stops; increasing the potential further reverses the reaction, turning the cell into an electrolytic cell. An experimental approach could involve gradually increasing the external potential while monitoring the current until it reaches zero, then continuing to observe the direction and magnitude of current flow, using a potentiostat with high precision voltage and current measurements to accurately determine the reversal potential.",
    "explanation": "The experiment should start by connecting the galvanic cell to a variable DC power supply and a sensitive ammeter. The potential is increased incrementally until the current reduces to zero, indicating the reaction is halted. Further increases will result in current in the opposite direction, signifying the reversal of the redox reaction and the onset of electrolytic behavior. Using calibrated instruments ensures accurate determination of the voltage at which these changes occur.",
