    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The rate of a reaction is influenced by factors such as the concentration of reactants, temperature, and the presence of catalysts. For the reaction 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2, experimental data shows that if the concentration of NO is doubled (with O2 constant), the rate increases fourfold, indicating a second order dependence on NO. Similarly, when the concentration of O2 is doubled (with NO constant), the rate doubles, indicating a first order dependence on O2. Therefore, the overall rate law is Rate = k [NO]² [O2]. This example illustrates how changes in concentration directly affect the rate of reaction as dictated by the rate law.",
    "explanation": "The explanation details that reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentrations of reactants raised to a power determined experimentally, with the given reaction confirming second order with respect to NO and first order for O2.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The overall balanced equation provides the stoichiometric ratios of reactants and products but does not necessarily reflect the actual mechanism of the reaction. The experimentally determined rate law reveals the true dependency of the reaction rate on reactant concentrations and often shows orders that are different from the stoichiometric coefficients. This difference is due to the fact that many reactions occur in multiple steps, with the rate-determining step controlling the overall rate. Thus, experimental determination of the rate law is essential to accurately understand the reaction mechanism and kinetics.",
