    "correct_answer": "An ideal solution is formed when the intermolecular interactions between like molecules (A-A and B-B) are nearly equal to the interactions between unlike molecules (A-B). In pure liquids, molecules interact only with identical neighbors, leading to specific interaction strengths. In a mixture, both like and unlike interactions occur. If A-B interactions match the strength of A-A and B-B interactions, there is no net energy change (ΔmixH = 0) and no volume change (ΔmixV = 0), resulting in ideal behavior according to Raoult's law. In non-ideal solutions, differences in these interactions cause deviations. For instance, if A-B interactions are weaker than A-A and B-B, the vapour pressure increases (positive deviation). Conversely, if A-B interactions are stronger, the vapour pressure decreases (negative deviation).",
    "explanation": "This answer contrasts the energy and volume changes upon mixing, emphasizing that the equality of intermolecular forces leads to ideal behavior, while any disparity leads to non-ideal deviations.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Deviations from Raoult's law affect the composition of the vapour and liquid phases in a mixture. In ideal solutions, the vapour composition is directly predictable from the liquid composition. However, in non-ideal solutions, positive or negative deviations cause the vapour composition to differ from that predicted by Raoult's law, complicating separation. Azeotropes, which occur at a specific composition where the liquid and vapour phases have the same composition, present a significant challenge in distillation. They boil at constant temperature, meaning conventional fractional distillation cannot separate the components beyond the azeotropic composition. This phenomenon forces the use of alternative separation techniques when dealing with azeotropic mixtures.",
    "explanation": "The response explains that non-ideal behavior alters the relative volatilities of the components, which is crucial in distillation. The concept of azeotropes is particularly significant because their constant boiling nature prohibits further separation by simple distillation.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Zero enthalpy of mixing means that no heat is absorbed or released when the components are mixed, and zero volume change means that the total volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes of the pure components. These conditions imply that the interactions between the molecules in the mixed state are essentially the same as in the pure state. As a result, the partial vapour pressures of the components can be accurately predicted using Raoult's law. The elimination of heat and volume changes simplifies the thermodynamic analysis, making it possible to assume that the relative contributions of each component to the total vapour pressure are directly proportional to their mole fractions.",
