    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Overall order = 2.5",
    "explanation": "The rate law is r = k [A]^(1/2) [B]^2. The order with respect to A is 1/2 and the order with respect to B is 2. Adding these exponents gives the overall order: 1/2 + 2 = 2.5. This concept is discussed in section 3.2.3 on the order of a reaction.",

    "question_text": "The conversion of molecules X to Y follows second order kinetics. If the concentration of X is increased to three times its initial value, how will it affect the rate of formation of Y?",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The rate will increase by a factor of 9",
    "explanation": "For a second order reaction, the rate is proportional to the square of the concentration. Therefore, if the concentration of X is tripled, the rate increases by (3)^2 = 9 times. This reasoning is based on the discussion of the dependence of rate on concentration in section 3.2.1.",
