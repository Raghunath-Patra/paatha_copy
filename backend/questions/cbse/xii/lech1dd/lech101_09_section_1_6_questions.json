    "correct_answer": "The method involves preparing a dilute solution of the solute and measuring its osmotic pressure at a known temperature using a setup with a semipermeable membrane. The osmotic pressure is given by the equation Π = (n₂/V) RT, where n₂ is the number of moles of solute, V is the volume, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. By rearranging the equation, the molar mass M₂ can be found using M₂ = (w₂ RT) / (Π V), where w₂ is the mass of the solute. This method is advantageously performed at room temperature, uses molarity instead of molality, and is particularly useful for biomolecules that may be unstable at higher temperatures or have low solubility.",

    "correct_answer": "Reverse osmosis utilizes the principle of osmosis in reverse by applying a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure to a salt water solution. This forces water molecules to pass through a semipermeable membrane that blocks salt and impurities. The key chemical principle involves the selective permeability of the membrane and the need to counteract the natural osmotic flow. Physically, high applied pressure overcomes the osmotic pressure, allowing only pure water to be extracted, which is then collected as potable water.",
    "explanation": "The process is effective because it separates solute from solvent based on molecular size and employs the reverse of the natural osmotic gradient. The applied pressure must be calculated precisely to exceed osmotic pressure but remain within the operating limits of the membrane, ensuring efficient purification.",
