Subsequently, carbon and other alloying metals like chromium, manganese, and nickel are added to produce steel with desired mechanical properties.",
    "explanation": "This answer covers the major steps in the production process: first, iron oxides are reduced to form elemental iron, followed by impurity removal. The addition of carbon adjusts the hardness and strength, while alloying elements like Cr, Mn, and Ni enhance specific properties such as corrosion resistance and durability, which are critical for construction materials.",

In contrast, TiCl₄ with Al(CH₃)₃ forms Ziegler catalysts, which are essential in initiating and controlling the polymerization of ethylene to produce polyethylene. Both catalyst systems are critical in their respective industries due to their effectiveness in increasing reaction rates and yields, although they operate via distinctly different mechanisms.",
    "explanation": "This answer contrasts two catalytic systems: one that operates in an oxidation reaction in the production of sulphuric acid and another that facilitates polymerization in the manufacture of polyethylene. V₂O₅ works by lowering the activation energy for the oxidation of SO₂, while the Ziegler catalyst, formed from TiCl₄ and Al(CH₃)₃, enables the polymerization of ethylene. Their industrial importance lies in their ability to improve reaction efficiency and product yields in large-scale chemical manufacturing.",
