    "correct_answer": "The bonding in metal carbonyls involves two distinct interactions. First, the M–C s bond is formed due to the donation of a lone pair of electrons from the carbonyl carbon into an empty orbital on the metal. Second, the M–C p bond is established by back-donation from a filled metal d orbital into the vacant antibonding p* orbital of carbon monoxide. This dual electron donation and acceptance mechanism is known as synergic bonding, which enhances the overall strength of the metal–CO bond. Together, these interactions facilitate a robust and stabilized bond between the metal and the carbon monoxide ligands.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The geometry of metal carbonyl complexes is influenced by several factors including the number of CO ligands, the electronic configuration of the metal, and steric considerations. For instance, Ni(CO)₄ adopts a tetrahedral geometry because four ligands around the nickel atom achieve maximum spatial separation in this configuration. Fe(CO)₅, with five ligands, assumes a trigonal bipyramidal shape to minimize electron repulsion and accommodate the ligand's positions efficiently. Cr(CO)₆ adopts an octahedral geometry, which is ideal for six-coordinate complexes as it allows for uniform distribution of the six carbonyl groups around the central chromium atom. These geometries are a result of the interplay between ligand field stabilization, steric factors, and the electronic requirements necessary for optimal metal-ligand bonding.",
