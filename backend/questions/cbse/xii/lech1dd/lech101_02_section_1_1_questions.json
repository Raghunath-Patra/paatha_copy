    "correct_answer": "The solvent determines the physical state of the solution because it is the major component. For example, in liquid solutions such as ethanol in water or glucose in water, water acts as the solvent and causes the solution to be liquid. Similarly, in gaseous solutions like camphor in nitrogen gas, the gas (nitrogen) is the solvent, which gives the solution its gaseous character. Examples from the section illustrate that irrespective of the solute's state, the solvent's state predominates in defining the overall state of the mixture.",
    "explanation": "The solvent is the component that is present in the largest quantity and inherently dictates the physical state of the solution. This is evident in examples where water, being a liquid, makes solutions liquid even if the solute is a gas or solid, and where nitrogen gas makes a mixture gaseous even if the solute is a solid, emphasizing the solvent's role.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Binary solutions are classified based on the physical states of the solute and solvent into gaseous, liquid, and solid solutions. For example, gaseous solutions can have a gas or liquid or even a solid as the solute in a gas solvent (e.g., camphor in nitrogen gas). In liquid solutions, the solvent is liquid with solutes ranging from gas (e.g., oxygen in water) to liquid (e.g., ethanol in water) to solid (e.g., glucose in water). Solid solutions include combinations where the solvent is solid and the solute can be gas, liquid, or solid (e.g., copper in gold). This classification aids in predicting the behavior of solutions in terms of properties like boiling point, reactivity, and application in specific fields like electronics, metallurgy, and pharmaceuticals.",
    "explanation": "By analyzing the different states of solutes and solvents in binary solutions, one can understand how each combination influences the overall properties of the solution. For instance, solvents dictate the state and thus affect the boiling point and solubility properties. Understanding these principles allows scientists to tailor solutions for specific applications and predict their behavior under varying conditions.",
