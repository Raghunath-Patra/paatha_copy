    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 2.25 × 10^22 electrons",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the total charge (Q) using Q = I × t. Here, I = 0.5 A and t = 2 hours = 7200 seconds. So, Q = 0.5 A × 7200 s = 3600 C. The number of electrons is then given by dividing the total charge by the charge of one electron (1.6021 × 10⁻¹⁹ C). Therefore, Number of electrons = 3600 C ÷ 1.6021 × 10⁻¹⁹ C ≈ 2.25 × 10^22 electrons.",

    "correct_answer": "Sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al)",
    "explanation": "Electrolytic extraction is used for metals that cannot be reduced by chemical means because their cations are very stable. The text mentions that many metals such as sodium, magnesium, and aluminum are produced on a large scale by electrolytic reduction of their respective cations, making them typical examples of metals extracted electrolytically.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 5.79 × 10^5 coulombs",
    "explanation": "According to Faraday's laws of electrolysis, the charge required for a redox reaction is given by Q = nF, where n is the number of electrons and F is Faraday's constant (approximately 96487 C/mol). In the given reaction, 6 electrons are required to reduce 1 mol of Cr₂O₇²⁻, so Q = 6 × 96487 C ≈ 578922 C, which is approximately 5.79 × 10^5 coulombs.",
