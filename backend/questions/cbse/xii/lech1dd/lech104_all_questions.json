    "correct_answer": "Because the Mn2+ ion has a half‐filled d5 configuration which is particularly stable due to exchange energy stabilization, whereas Fe2+ with a d6 configuration does not have the same degree of extra stability.",
    "explanation": "The d5 configuration in Mn2+ offers maximum exchange stabilization (all five d electrons are unpaired) making Mn2+ more resistant to further oxidation. In comparison, Fe2+ (d6) lacks this extra stabilization, hence it oxidizes more readily to Fe3+.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the first half of the series, as the atomic number increases, the increasing nuclear charge and a relatively small change in atomic radii lead to greater stabilization of the d electrons. This favors removal of only the s electrons to form the +2 state, making it increasingly stable.",
    "explanation": "Due to the effective nuclear charge increasing across the period, and because the d electrons offer some exchange stabilization, the removal of only the s electrons (giving rise to the +2 state) becomes energetically favorable. The trend is a consequence of the interplay between ionization energies and the stability of partially filled d orbitals.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electronic configurations play a fundamental role in determining the stability of various oxidation states. In these elements, configurations that result in half-filled (e.g., d5) or fully filled (d10) subshells are particularly stable. For example, Cr forms Cr3+ with a d3 configuration while Cu+ (with a d10 configuration) is very stable, and compounds with these ions exhibit characteristic properties.",
    "explanation": "The stability of oxidation states is influenced by the energy required to remove electrons and the exchange energy stabilization that results from certain configurations. Half-filled and completely filled d subshells provide extra stability, as seen in the particularly stable configurations of d5 and d10. This explains why, for instance, Cu+ with a d10 configuration is more stable than would be expected, and why transition metals exhibit a range of oxidation states with small differences.",

    "explanation": "The stable oxidation state in the first row transition metals is often +2 because they lose the two outermost s electrons.

    "correct_answer": "Lanthanoid contraction refers to the gradual decrease in the ionic radii of the lanthanoid elements as the atomic number increases, due to the poor shielding of the nuclear charge by the 4f electrons. A major consequence is that the 4d and 5d transition metals often have very similar radii.",
    "explanation": "The ineffective shielding by the 4f electrons means that despite an increasing nuclear charge, the outer electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus. This results in a contraction of the ionic and atomic radii across the series.

    "correct_answer": "Transition elements are characterized by variable oxidation states, the presence of partially filled d orbitals, formation of colored compounds, high melting and boiling points, paramagnetism, and catalytic activity. They are called transition elements because they lie in the central block of the periodic table between the s- and p-blocks. However, Zn, Cd, Hg (and sometimes Cn) are not regarded as transition elements because their d orbitals are completely filled in both the ground and common oxidation states.",
    "explanation": "The defining properties of transition metals arise mainly from the involvement of the d electrons in bonding. This leads to a rich chemistry including variable oxidation states, magnetism, and colored compounds.

Non transition elements do not have this characteristic, as their d orbitals (if present) are either completely empty or completely filled.",
    "explanation": "The unique aspect of transition elements is that the d orbitals are being filled progressively, resulting in partially filled orbitals that contribute to variable oxidation states, magnetism and color.

    "explanation": "The chemistry of the lanthanoids is largely dominated by the +3 state due to the similar energy levels of the 4f electrons.

(iii) The formation of coloured compounds is due to d-d transitions that absorb light in the visible region. (iv) Their catalytic activity stems from variable oxidation states and the ability to form complexes that facilitate reactions.",
    "explanation": "Transition metals have partially filled d orbitals resulting in unpaired electrons that create magnetic moments (paramagnetism). The metallic bonding is strong because electrons from d and s orbitals contribute to it, leading to high atomisation energies.

Transition metals form such compounds because of their relatively small atomic sizes, high lattice energies and the availability of interstitial spaces in their crystal structures.",
    "explanation": "Due to the small size of interstitial atoms, they can be accommodated within the gaps of a metal’s lattice.

The chromate solution is then acidified with sulphuric acid to convert it into dichromate, and finally, potassium chloride is added to precipitate potassium dichromate. Increasing the pH of a dichromate solution shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of chromate ions, changing the solution color from orange to yellow.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with the fusion of chromite with a carbonate to produce a soluble chromate salt. Acidification converts chromate to dichromate according to the equilibrium: 2 CrO4^2- + 2 H+ ⇄ Cr2O7^2- + H2O.

For (ii), the stability of Co2+ in water is attributed to its specific d electron configuration, but when complexed, ligand field effects lower its energy barrier for oxidation.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For (i), lower oxides such as MnO are basic due to their ionic character, whereas higher oxides like Mn2O7 are acidic because the metal in a high oxidation state pulls electron density from oxygen, increasing covalency. For (ii), metals reach their highest oxidation states in compounds with highly electronegative elements like oxygen and fluorine, which stabilize the high positive charge. For (iii), oxoanions such as CrO4^2- feature metals in a high oxidation state because the multiple bonds with oxygen distribute the high positive charge effectively.",
    "explanation": "The difference in the acid-base character of oxides is a result of the increasing covalent character as the oxidation state rises. High oxidation states are stabilized by strong electronegative ligands, and in oxoanions the extensive oxygen bonding helps to distribute the charge, leading to more acidic behavior.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For K2Cr2O7: Chromite ore (FeCr2O4) is fused with potassium carbonate in air to form a soluble chromate salt, then acidified with sulphuric acid to convert chromate to dichromate, followed by addition of potassium chloride to precipitate K2Cr2O7. For KMnO4: Pyrolusite (MnO2) is fused with an alkali (KOH) and an oxidising agent to form manganate (K2MnO4), which is then oxidised (often electrolytically) and acidified to yield KMnO4.",
    "explanation": "Both processes involve converting a naturally occurring manganese or chromium oxide into a soluble salt, then altering the oxidation state via acidification or oxidation.

This results in less regular trends in their chemical behavior. In contrast, lanthanoids predominantly exhibit the +3 oxidation state with only minor deviations.",

    "explanation": "The occurrence of oxidation states in lanthanoids is largely determined by the stability of the resulting f electron configuration.

Actinoids are also generally more reactive owing to the less effective shielding of 5f electrons.",

In contrast, the second and third series, although having similar valence shell electron configurations, benefit from the lanthanoid contraction, which results in higher ionisation enthalpies and similar atomic sizes despite being in different periods.",
    "explanation": "Differences among the three series come from relativistic effects and the extent of orbital contraction.

In an octahedral field, the five 3d orbitals split into lower-energy t2g and higher-energy eg orbitals. Depending on the ligand field strength, electrons will either occupy them in a high-spin arrangement (maximizing unpaired electrons) or low-spin if the ligand field is strong.",

As the number of unpaired electrons increases, stronger interatomic bonds are formed. This increased bonding energy is reflected in higher melting and boiling points. The melting point trends generally rise towards the middle of the series where bonding is the strongest due to a nearly half-filled d-subshell, then decrease as the number of bonding electrons declines.",
    "explanation": "The trend in enthalpy and melting points is explained by considering how additional (n-1)d electrons participate in bonding.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The irregular trend in ionisation enthalpies in the 3d series is due to changes in electron configuration, particularly the relative energies of the 4s and 3d orbitals. When electrons are removed, particularly from orbitals that are involved in shielding, the effective nuclear charge experienced by the remaining electrons changes. Additionally, the loss of exchange energy, which stabilizes configurations with maximum unpaired electrons, contributes to variations. Thus, the removal of a 4s electron first and subsequent removal from a 3d orbital creates irregularities in the successive ionisation enthalpy values.",
    "explanation": "The interplay between the decrease in exchange energy, changes in shielding, and shifts in the relative energy levels of the 4s and 3d orbitals all contribute to the observed irregular trends.

The specific energy gap between these orbitals, which is influenced by the nature of the ligands coordinated around the metal ion (ligand field), determines the wavelength of light absorbed. The observed color is the complementary color of the absorbed light. The strength of the ligand field, determined by the ligand's nature, directly affects the magnitude of splitting between the d orbitals.",
    "explanation": "The ligand field theory explains that the electrons in the d orbitals split into different energy levels when surrounded by ligands.

This contraction explains why elements in the third transition series have similar atomic radii.",

This stability lowers the energy required to lose electrons from the outer s orbital rather than disturbing the stable f configuration.",

In tripositive ions, the configuration simplifies to 4f^n where n ranges from 1 to 14 across the series. The occupancy of the 4f orbital plays a critical role in determining properties such as magnetism, colour, and reactivity because the 4f electrons are shielded and only weakly interact with the external environment.",
    "explanation": "This discussion highlights that while the outer 6s electrons are common to all lanthanoids, the key variations arise from the 4f electrons. The gradual filling of the 4f sub-shell in the tripositive state results in characteristic trends in properties like ionic radii and magnetic behaviour.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Lanthanoid contraction leads to a decrease in the atomic and ionic radii of the lanthanoids, which in turn makes the atomic sizes of the third transition series elements very similar to their second series counterparts. For example, zirconium (Zr) and hafnium (Hf) have nearly identical atomic radii (160 pm and 159 pm, respectively), which is a direct consequence of the lanthanoid contraction. This similarity complicates their separation during the extraction process and often results in their occurrence together in nature.",
    "explanation": "The contraction is due to the poor shielding of the 4f electrons, which increases the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electrons. This subtle size difference affects not only the separation processes industrially but also influences the chemical and physical behaviour of the elements in these series.

    "correct_answer": "Lanthanoids react readily with many substances owing to their metallic nature and variable oxidation states. When burned in oxygen, they form Ln₂O₃. Their reaction with acids results in the production of hydrogen gas, while reaction with halogens produces LnX₃. With water, they yield hydroxides (Ln(OH)₃) along with hydrogen gas. Heating with carbon produces various carbides such as Ln₃C, Ln₂C₃, and LnC₂, and similar reactions occur with nitrogen and sulfur to produce nitrides and sulfides respectively. The prevalent +3 oxidation state dominates these reactions, though occasional +2 and +4 states might occur, influenced by the stability of half-filled or completely filled 4f orbitals.",
    "explanation": "The reactivity is determined by the ability of lanthanoid atoms to lose electrons easily due to their low ionisation energies for the first and second electrons. Their +3 state is the most stable; however, the unique electron configurations (especially in elements like Ce, Eu, and Yb) allow for redox chemistry involving other oxidation states.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The variety of oxidation states in actinoids is primarily due to the comparable energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals. This closeness in energy facilitates the participation of electrons from these orbitals in bonding, allowing actinoids to exhibit oxidation states from +3 up to +7 (in some cases). In contrast, lanthanoids, with their mostly buried 4f electrons, tend to have a more limited range and most commonly exhibit the +3 oxidation state. Additionally, the stabilization offered by half-filled (f^7) and fully filled (f^14) 5f orbitals in actinoids introduces irregularities in their electron configurations, further diversifying their chemistry.",
    "explanation": "Factors such as similar orbital energies and the extent of electron shielding have a significant role in determining oxidation states. The actinoids benefit from the 5f orbital’s ability to participate in bonding, unlike the more core-like 4f orbitals in lanthanoids, which contributes to the observed broader range of oxidation states in actinoids.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The actinoid contraction leads to a decrease in atomic and ionic sizes across the series, which in turn affects the electron cloud and the effective nuclear charge of the subsequent elements. This can influence properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, and bonding characteristics. Although the lanthanoid contraction is more widely known, the actinoid contraction also plays a role in modifying the physical and chemical properties of elements that follow them. This contraction makes the outer electrons of succeeding elements experience a higher effective nuclear charge, which may lead to variations in reactivity and formation of different oxidation states.",
    "explanation": "The contraction effect influences the periodic trends by making the outer electrons in subsequent elements less shielded. This not only alters their sizes but also their chemical reactivity and bonding patterns.

    "explanation": "When one electron is added (moving from a higher oxidation state to a lower one), the effective nuclear charge felt by the electrons is reduced because the additional electron partly screens the nucleus.
