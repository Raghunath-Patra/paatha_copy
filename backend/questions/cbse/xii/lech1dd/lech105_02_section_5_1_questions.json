    "correct_answer": "Werner's theory was groundbreaking because it introduced the concept of differentiating between the primary (ionisable) and secondary (non-ionisable) valences in coordination compounds. This theory allowed chemists to understand and predict the spatial arrangement of ligands around a central metal. Experiments such as the controlled precipitation of AgCl with complexes like [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺3Cl⁻ confirmed that only the counter ions were free in solution, as evidenced by conductivity measurements showing specific electrolyte ratios. These observations substantiated that ligands inside the coordination sphere remain bound, thus validating the structural postulates of the theory.",
    "explanation": "The answer should include details of how the experimental data (e.g., the precipitation of AgCl in different amounts) supports the idea that not all chloride ions are free. The conductivity measurements further demonstrate that the ionisable groups (primary valence) are separate from the coordination complex (secondary valence), leading to a better understanding of the coordination number and geometry of the complexes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Isomerism in coordination compounds occurs when complexes have the same empirical formula but differ in the spatial arrangement of ligands. In the case of the cobalt chloride-ammonia complexes with the formula CoCl₃.4NH₃, the green and violet forms have different ligand arrangements around the cobalt ion even though they contain the same types and numbers of atoms. This difference in arrangement leads to variations in properties such as color and reactivity, which is a clear indication of stereoisomerism.",
    "explanation": "A comprehensive answer should discuss that the same chemical formula can lead to different three-dimensional structures. This is due to the different positions that ligands may occupy around the central metal ion. Differences in spatial orientation affect the overall symmetry and electronic environment, leading to observable differences in properties such as color, solubility, and reactivity.",
