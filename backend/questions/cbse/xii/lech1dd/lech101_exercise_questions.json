    "correct_answer": "A solution is a homogeneous mixture in which the composition is uniform throughout. It consists of a solvent (present in the larger amount) and one or more solutes. The types of solutions formed are usually classified as gaseous solutions, liquid solutions, and solid solutions. For example, in gaseous solutions, both solute and solvent are gases (e.g., oxygen–nitrogen mixtures), in liquid solutions the solute can be a gas, liquid or solid dissolved in a liquid (e.g., glucose in water), and in solid solutions, a solid is dissolved in another solid (e.g., copper in gold).",
    "explanation": "This answer defines a solution and explains that its uniform composition makes it homogeneous. It then identifies the three main types along with examples from the chapter content. The explanation is based on the classification provided in Table 1.1 and the text description.",

    "explanation": "n-Octane is nonpolar; therefore, substances with nonpolar character are more soluble in it. KCl, being ionic, is insoluble in nonpolar solvents. CH₃OH is polar and hydrogen-bonding but only moderately soluble in n-octane, while CH₃CN is polar with less hydrogen bonding and more compatible with nonpolar solvents. Cyclohexane is nonpolar and thus the most soluble in itself.",
