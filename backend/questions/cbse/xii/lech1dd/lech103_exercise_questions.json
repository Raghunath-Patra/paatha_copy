    "explanation": "For each rate expression, the overall order is the exponent on the concentration term. In (i) and (ii) the exponents sum to 2 so the reaction is second order, and for a second‐order reaction (with rate in mol·L⁻¹·s⁻¹) the rate constant has units L·mol⁻¹·s⁻¹. In (iii) the only concentration term is raised to the 3/2 power, so the reaction is 1.5 order and the corresponding k must compensate dimensionally: (mol·L⁻¹)^(3/2) multiplied by k gives mol·L⁻¹·s⁻¹, yielding k with units L^(0.5)·mol^(–0.5)·s⁻¹.

    "correct_answer": "Analysis of the Arrhenius plot yields an activation energy of approximately 52.9 kJ·mol⁻¹ and a pre-exponential factor A on the order of 10¹² s⁻¹. Using these values, the predicted rate constants at 30°C and 50°C can be calculated by k = A exp(-Ea/(RT)).",
