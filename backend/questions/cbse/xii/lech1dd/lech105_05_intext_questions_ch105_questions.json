    "explanation": "In this compound, cobalt is in the +3 oxidation state and is coordinated by four ammonia (NH₃) and two water (H₂O) molecules to give an octahedral coordination sphere. The six ligands form the coordination entity [Co(NH₃)₄(H₂O)₂]³⁺, which is balanced by three chloride ions (Cl⁻) as counter ions. This follows Werner’s theory on primary and secondary valences where the six coordination sites (secondary valence) are occupied by neutral molecules.",

    "correct_answer": "K₂[Ni(CN)₄]",
    "explanation": "The complex ion in this compound is [Ni(CN)₄]²⁻ where nickel has an oxidation state of +2. Each cyanide (CN⁻) ligand contributes a -1 charge, leading to an overall charge of -2. Potassium ions (K⁺) balance the complex charge and, since two K⁺ ions provide a total +2 charge, the complete formula is K₂[Ni(CN)₄]. This uses the concept of counter ions balancing the charge on the coordination entity.",

    "explanation": "Here, the ligand ethane‐1,2‐diamine (abbreviated as en) is a bidentate ligand. Three such en ligands surround a chromium(III) ion in an octahedral arrangement, forming the coordination ion [Cr(en)₃]³⁺. In order to balance the 3+ charge, three chloride ions (Cl⁻) are present as counter ions, giving the formula [Cr(en)₃]Cl₃. This reflects Werner’s idea of fixed coordination numbers.",

    "explanation": "In this complex, platinum is in the +2 oxidation state. The ligands bound to Pt are one ammine (NH₃), one bromido (Br⁻), one chlorido (Cl⁻), and one nitrito ligand binding through nitrogen (NO₂⁻). Adding their charges: Pt(+2) + [0 for NH₃] + (–1 for Br) + (–1 for Cl) + (–1 for NO₂) results in an overall −1 charge for the coordination entity. Hence, the formula is written as [Pt(NH₃)(Br)(Cl)(NO₂)]⁻. This example demonstrates the concept of coordination sphere and ligand bonding as described by Werner.",

The two nitrate ions (NO₃⁻) balance the 2+ charge of the coordination entity.

    "explanation": "In this compound, the complex ion [Fe(CN)₆] carries cyanide ligands with the central Fe in the +2 oxidation state, yielding an overall charge of –4 per complex (since 6 × (–1) +2 = –4). To balance the charges, four Fe(III) ions (each +3) combine with three [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ ions to give an electrically neutral compound: 4 × (+3) + 3 × (–4) = 0. The formula is therefore Fe₄[Fe(CN)₆]₃, which is a classic example of a complex double salt explained by coordination theory.",

    "explanation": "In K₃[Fe(CN)₆], the complex ion [Fe(CN)₆] has a charge of –3, which means that the iron must be in the +3 oxidation state considering each cyanide (CN⁻) carries a –1 charge. In anionic complexes, the metal name is modified to end in –ate; hence iron becomes ferrate. The three potassium ions (K⁺) balance the negative charge. Therefore, the IUPAC name is potassium hexacyanidoferrate(III).",

Given the overall –3 charge of the complex ion, iron must be in the +3 oxidation state. Following IUPAC rules for anionic complexes, the metal name is altered to ferrate, and the ligands are named with the prefix trioxalato. Thus, the compound is named potassium trioxalatoferrate(III).",

Palladium in an anionic complex has its name modified to palladate. The oxidation state of palladium is +2, obtained from balancing the four –1 charges of chloride with the overall –2 charge of the complex ion.

    "explanation": "For the complex [Pt(NH₃)₂Cl(NH₂CH₃)]⁺, platinum is coordinated by two ammine (NH₃) ligands, one chlorido (Cl⁻) ligand, and one methylamine (NH₂CH₃) ligand. The ligands are listed in alphabetical order when naming and appropriate prefixes are used; here, 'diammine' reflects the two NH₃ ligands. Calculating the oxidation state: Pt + (0 × 2) + (–1) + (0) = +1 overall for the cation (balanced by one chloride counter ion). However, by convention and IUPAC recommendations for platinum complexes, the oxidation state is identified as +2. (Calculating: if Pt is +2, then +2 –1 = +1, in agreement with the overall charge of the complex cation.) Hence the name is diamminechlorido(methylamine)platinum(II) chloride.",
