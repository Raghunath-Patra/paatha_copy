Mathematically, it is expressed as p = KH × x, where p is the partial pressure, KH is the Henry's law constant, and x is the mole fraction of the gas in solution. This law is important industrially, for example, to increase the solubility of CO2 in soft drinks by sealing the bottle under high pressure.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An increase in pressure increases the number of gas molecules per unit volume, which in turn increases the rate at which these molecules collide with the liquid surface and dissolve into it. The piston diagram illustrates this by showing two states: one at lower pressure and one at higher pressure. In the diagram, the addition of weight on the piston compresses the gas phase, thereby increasing its concentration. This increased pressure causes a shift in the dynamic equilibrium, leading to a higher concentration of dissolved gas in the solution.",
    "explanation": "The answer includes an explanation of how increased pressure enhances the solubility of gases by increasing molecular collisions as described by Henry's law.
