    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ligand denticity plays a crucial role in the stability of coordination complexes. Ligands that can attach to a metal ion through multiple donor atoms, such as didentate or polydentate ligands, form rings around the metal ion known as chelate rings. These chelate rings reduce the likelihood of ligand dissociation due to the chelate effect, which increases the stability of the complex compared to those formed with unidentate ligands.",
    "explanation": "The enhanced stability from chelation is partly due to entropy considerations; replacing several monodentate ligands with one multidentate ligand results in an increase in the number of particles in solution. This entropic gain, along with the formation of stable ring structures, makes chelate complexes less likely to dissociate than their monodentate counterparts.",

    "correct_answer": "The coordination number of a coordination compound is determined by counting the number of ligand donor atoms that form sigma bonds with the central metal ion. For instance, in [PtCl6]²⁻, each chloride ion contributes a single donor atom, resulting in a coordination number of 6. Similarly, for [Ni(NH3)4]²⁺, the four ammonia molecules each donate one electron pair, leading to a coordination number of 4. Even if a ligand is polydentate, only the number of donor atoms used in bonding is counted.",

    "correct_answer": "The spatial arrangement of ligands around the central metal ion, known as the coordination polyhedron, directly influences the complex’s physical and chemical properties, such as color, magnetism, and reactivity. Octahedral, tetrahedral, and square planar geometries, for example, result in different crystal field splitting patterns, which affect the electronic transitions and magnetic behavior of the complex. Moreover, steric factors and ligand positions can influence substitution reaction mechanisms and the overall stability of the complex.",
    "explanation": "Different geometries lead to varied splitting of the d-orbitals (crystal field theory), which in turn alters spectral properties and magnetic moments. Additionally, the spatial arrangement impacts the accessibility of the metal center for reactants, thereby affecting catalytic or substitution reactions.
