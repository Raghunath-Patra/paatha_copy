    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Corrosion of iron is an electrochemical process involving two key reactions. At the anodic sites, iron is oxidized (Fe (s) → Fe²⁺ (aq) + 2e⁻), releasing electrons. These electrons travel to cathodic sites where oxygen is reduced in the presence of H⁺ (O2 (g) + 4H⁺ (aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H2O (l)). The produced ferrous ions can further oxidize with oxygen to form hydrated ferric oxide (rust).",
    "explanation": "The process starts with localized oxidation (anodic reaction) on the metal surface generating Fe²⁺ ions. Concurrently, at the cathodic sites, electrons reduce oxygen to water.
