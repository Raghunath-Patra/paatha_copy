    "explanation": "The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution illustrates that at higher temperatures, not only does the average kinetic energy increase, but also more molecules obtain energies above the threshold needed for the reaction (activation energy).

It temporarily forms an intermediate complex with the reactants, facilitating their conversion to products. Despite lowering the activation energy and speeding up the reaction, the catalyst does not change the thermodynamics of the reaction; therefore, the overall Gibbs energy change and the equilibrium constant remain unchanged.",
    "explanation": "Catalysts work by offering a new mechanism that bypasses the high energy barrier present in the slow, uncatalyzed reaction. They participate in the reaction by forming short-lived intermediates; however, since they are regenerated by the end of the reaction, they do not alter the reaction's free energy change or shift the position of equilibrium.

    "correct_answer": "Lowering the activation energy exponentially increases the rate constant, as per the Arrhenius equation k = A exp(-Ea/(RT)). Experimentally, activation energy can be determined by measuring the rate constant k at various temperatures and plotting ln k versus 1/T. The slope of the resulting straight line, which is -Ea/R, allows calculation of Ea. This method is widely used in kinetics studies.",
    "explanation": "The Arrhenius equation shows an exponential dependence of the rate constant on the activation energy; therefore, a modest reduction in Ea can lead to a significant rate enhancement. In practice, one can measure reaction rates at different temperatures, plot ln k against 1/T, and use the linear relationship to extract the activation energy from the slope.
