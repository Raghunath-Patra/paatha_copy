This equation shows that the standard cell potential is directly related to the logarithm of the equilibrium constant, allowing us to calculate difficult-to-measure equilibrium constants from standard potential measurements.",
    "explanation": "At equilibrium, the cell potential is zero. Starting from the Nernst equation: 0 = E°cell - (RT/nF) ln Q and recognizing that at equilibrium Q = K, rearranging gives E°cell = (RT/nF) ln K. Converting to base 10 logarithm using ln x = 2.303 log x leads to E°cell = (2.303 RT/nF) log K.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Changes in ion concentrations affect the reaction quotient Q in the Nernst equation. For example, increasing Cu²⁺ concentration or decreasing Zn²⁺ concentration will increase the cell potential since the term ln([Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺]) decreases. Temperature also plays a role since the factor (RT/nF) in the Nernst equation will increase with temperature, amplifying the impact of concentration changes on cell potential.",
    "explanation": "According to the Nernst equation, Ecell = E°cell - (RT/nF) ln([Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺]). When [Cu²⁺] increases, the ratio [Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺] decreases, resulting in a lower value of the logarithmic term and hence a higher cell potential. Conversely, an increase in [Zn²⁺] raises the value of the logarithmic term, decreasing the cell potential. Additionally, an increase in temperature (T) raises the (RT/nF) factor, meaning that for the same change in concentration, the potential change will be more pronounced at higher temperatures.",
