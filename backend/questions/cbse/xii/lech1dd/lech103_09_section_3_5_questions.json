This simplification leads to deviations in predicting rate constants for reactions involving large or complex molecules, as the internal energy distribution, vibrational modes, and electronic interactions are neglected.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "correct_answer": "An experimental determination of the rate constant using collision theory would involve measuring the collision frequency (Z), which depends on reactant concentrations and temperature. The activation energy (Ea) can be determined from temperature-dependent rate measurements using the Arrhenius plot. The steric factor (P) is evaluated by comparing experimental rate constants to those predicted by the collision frequency and activation energy alone. Together, these parameters allow for calculation of the effective rate constant by correcting for non-reactive collisions due to improper orientation.",
