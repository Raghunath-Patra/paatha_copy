    "correct_answer": "Because the Mn2+ ion has a half‐filled d5 configuration which is particularly stable due to exchange energy stabilization, whereas Fe2+ with a d6 configuration does not have the same degree of extra stability.",
    "explanation": "The d5 configuration in Mn2+ offers maximum exchange stabilization (all five d electrons are unpaired) making Mn2+ more resistant to further oxidation. In comparison, Fe2+ (d6) lacks this extra stabilization, hence it oxidizes more readily to Fe3+.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the first half of the series, as the atomic number increases, the increasing nuclear charge and a relatively small change in atomic radii lead to greater stabilization of the d electrons. This favors removal of only the s electrons to form the +2 state, making it increasingly stable.",
    "explanation": "Due to the effective nuclear charge increasing across the period, and because the d electrons offer some exchange stabilization, the removal of only the s electrons (giving rise to the +2 state) becomes energetically favorable. The trend is a consequence of the interplay between ionization energies and the stability of partially filled d orbitals.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electronic configurations play a fundamental role in determining the stability of various oxidation states. In these elements, configurations that result in half-filled (e.g., d5) or fully filled (d10) subshells are particularly stable. For example, Cr forms Cr3+ with a d3 configuration while Cu+ (with a d10 configuration) is very stable, and compounds with these ions exhibit characteristic properties.",
    "explanation": "The stability of oxidation states is influenced by the energy required to remove electrons and the exchange energy stabilization that results from certain configurations. Half-filled and completely filled d subshells provide extra stability, as seen in the particularly stable configurations of d5 and d10. This explains why, for instance, Cu+ with a d10 configuration is more stable than would be expected, and why transition metals exhibit a range of oxidation states with small differences.",

    "explanation": "The stable oxidation state in the first row transition metals is often +2 because they lose the two outermost s electrons.

    "correct_answer": "Lanthanoid contraction refers to the gradual decrease in the ionic radii of the lanthanoid elements as the atomic number increases, due to the poor shielding of the nuclear charge by the 4f electrons. A major consequence is that the 4d and 5d transition metals often have very similar radii.",
    "explanation": "The ineffective shielding by the 4f electrons means that despite an increasing nuclear charge, the outer electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus. This results in a contraction of the ionic and atomic radii across the series.

    "correct_answer": "Transition elements are characterized by variable oxidation states, the presence of partially filled d orbitals, formation of colored compounds, high melting and boiling points, paramagnetism, and catalytic activity. They are called transition elements because they lie in the central block of the periodic table between the s- and p-blocks. However, Zn, Cd, Hg (and sometimes Cn) are not regarded as transition elements because their d orbitals are completely filled in both the ground and common oxidation states.",
    "explanation": "The defining properties of transition metals arise mainly from the involvement of the d electrons in bonding. This leads to a rich chemistry including variable oxidation states, magnetism, and colored compounds.

Non transition elements do not have this characteristic, as their d orbitals (if present) are either completely empty or completely filled.",
    "explanation": "The unique aspect of transition elements is that the d orbitals are being filled progressively, resulting in partially filled orbitals that contribute to variable oxidation states, magnetism and color.

    "explanation": "The chemistry of the lanthanoids is largely dominated by the +3 state due to the similar energy levels of the 4f electrons.

(iii) The formation of coloured compounds is due to d-d transitions that absorb light in the visible region. (iv) Their catalytic activity stems from variable oxidation states and the ability to form complexes that facilitate reactions.",
    "explanation": "Transition metals have partially filled d orbitals resulting in unpaired electrons that create magnetic moments (paramagnetism). The metallic bonding is strong because electrons from d and s orbitals contribute to it, leading to high atomisation energies.

Transition metals form such compounds because of their relatively small atomic sizes, high lattice energies and the availability of interstitial spaces in their crystal structures.",
    "explanation": "Due to the small size of interstitial atoms, they can be accommodated within the gaps of a metal’s lattice.

The chromate solution is then acidified with sulphuric acid to convert it into dichromate, and finally, potassium chloride is added to precipitate potassium dichromate. Increasing the pH of a dichromate solution shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of chromate ions, changing the solution color from orange to yellow.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with the fusion of chromite with a carbonate to produce a soluble chromate salt. Acidification converts chromate to dichromate according to the equilibrium: 2 CrO4^2- + 2 H+ ⇄ Cr2O7^2- + H2O.

For (ii), the stability of Co2+ in water is attributed to its specific d electron configuration, but when complexed, ligand field effects lower its energy barrier for oxidation.

    "question_text": "Give examples and suggest reasons for the following features of transition metal chemistry: (i) the lowest oxide of a transition metal is basic, the highest is amphoteric/acidic; (ii) a transition metal exhibits its highest oxidation state in oxides and fluorides; (iii) the highest oxidation state is exhibited in oxoanions of a metal.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For (i), lower oxides such as MnO are basic due to their ionic character, whereas higher oxides like Mn2O7 are acidic because the metal in a high oxidation state pulls electron density from oxygen, increasing covalency. For (ii), metals reach their highest oxidation states in compounds with highly electronegative elements like oxygen and fluorine, which stabilize the high positive charge. For (iii), oxoanions such as CrO4^2- feature metals in a high oxidation state because the multiple bonds with oxygen distribute the high positive charge effectively.",
    "explanation": "The difference in the acid-base character of oxides is a result of the increasing covalent character as the oxidation state rises. High oxidation states are stabilized by strong electronegative ligands, and in oxoanions the extensive oxygen bonding helps to distribute the charge, leading to more acidic behavior.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For K2Cr2O7: Chromite ore (FeCr2O4) is fused with potassium carbonate in air to form a soluble chromate salt, then acidified with sulphuric acid to convert chromate to dichromate, followed by addition of potassium chloride to precipitate K2Cr2O7. For KMnO4: Pyrolusite (MnO2) is fused with an alkali (KOH) and an oxidising agent to form manganate (K2MnO4), which is then oxidised (often electrolytically) and acidified to yield KMnO4.",
    "explanation": "Both processes involve converting a naturally occurring manganese or chromium oxide into a soluble salt, then altering the oxidation state via acidification or oxidation. The key steps include fusion, acidification and precipitation for potassium dichromate, while for potassium permanganate, an additional oxidation step is required to move from manganate to permanganate.",

    "explanation": "Inner transition elements are defined as the f-block elements (lanthanoids and actinoids). The provided atomic numbers are compared with the typical ranges: lanthanoids span from 57 to 71 and actinoids from 89 to 103. Thus, only 59, 95, and 102 fall within these ranges.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Actinoids exhibit a wide range of oxidation states (e.g., from +3 up to +7 in the early actinoids) due to the involvement of their 5f electrons in bonding, which are less shielded compared to the 4f electrons of lanthanoids. This results in less regular trends in their chemical behavior. In contrast, lanthanoids predominantly exhibit the +3 oxidation state with only minor deviations.",
    "explanation": "The variable participation of 5f electrons in actinoid bonding leads to irregular oxidation state patterns and chemical properties. For example, uranium can exist in the +6 state, neptunium and plutonium show several oxidation states, whereas the lanthanoids mostly remain in the +3 state, resulting in smoother trends.",

Europium and ytterbium commonly exhibit +2 oxidation states, which are stabilized by their half-filled (Eu, f7) and completely filled (Yb, f14) f subshells, respectively.",
    "explanation": "The occurrence of oxidation states in lanthanoids is largely determined by the stability of the resulting f electron configuration. In cerium, losing an additional electron to form Ce4+ leads to an empty 4f subshell, which is particularly stable. Conversely, the stability of the f7 and f14 configurations in europium and ytterbium, respectively, makes the +2 state more favorable.",

    "correct_answer": "Actinoids show greater variability in electronic configurations due to the involvement of their 5f electrons in bonding, resulting in a wider range of oxidation states (from +3 up to +7 in early actinoids) compared to the lanthanoids, which predominantly exhibit the +3 state. Actinoids are also generally more reactive owing to the less effective shielding of 5f electrons.",
    "explanation": "While both series exhibit contraction effects, the 5f electrons in actinoids are more involved in bonding, leading to irregular and varied oxidation states. Lanthanoids, on the other hand, maintain a more uniform chemistry primarily in the +3 state.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "correct_answer": "The first series of transition metals shows greater variability in electronic configurations and oxidation states because only the 3d orbitals are involved, resulting in relatively lower ionisation enthalpies and smaller atomic sizes. In contrast, the second and third series, although having similar valence shell electron configurations, benefit from the lanthanoid contraction, which results in higher ionisation enthalpies and similar atomic sizes despite being in different periods.",
    "explanation": "Differences among the three series come from relativistic effects and the extent of orbital contraction. While 3d metals exhibit more pronounced variations in their properties, the 4d and 5d metals are more similar to each other as a result of the contraction phenomena, leading to higher stability in their electronic and chemical properties.",

In an octahedral field, the five 3d orbitals split into lower-energy t2g and higher-energy eg orbitals. Depending on the ligand field strength, electrons will either occupy them in a high-spin arrangement (maximizing unpaired electrons) or low-spin if the ligand field is strong.",
    "explanation": "The number of 3d electrons is determined by subtracting the electrons lost from the neutral atom. The crystal field splitting in an octahedral complex divides the 3d orbitals into a set of three t2g orbitals and two eg orbitals.

This results in less regular trends in the 3d series compared to the smoother trends observed in the 4d and 5d series.",
