    "correct_answer": "Werner’s theory explains that in coordination compounds the metal ion has two types of valencies. The primary valence (or oxidation state) is satisfied by ionizable anions located outside the coordination sphere, while the secondary valence (or coordination number) is satisfied by neutral molecules or anions that are held directly to the metal ion in a defined spatial arrangement. Consequently, compounds can have identical empirical formulas but differ in properties if the positions of the ligands differ.",
    "explanation": "According to Werner’s theory, the metal ion forms a complex with a definite number of ligands (secondary valence) which are arranged spatially as coordinated groups. The primary valence is the charge-balancing part that can be ionized in solution. This fundamental distinction explains phenomena like isomerism and the different reactivities of ions in solution.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Fe²⁺ ion remains free in solution in the presence of sulfate and ammonium ions, so its characteristic test can be observed. In contrast, copper(II) ions form a stable complex with ammonia (e.g., [Cu(NH3)4]²⁺) when added in excess, which ties up the Cu²⁺ ions and prevents them from giving the test specific to free copper(II) ions.",
    "explanation": "In the FeSO4/(NH4)2SO4 system, there is no strong ligand that binds to Fe²⁺ to alter its detection, so the test for Fe²⁺ is positive. However, aqueous ammonia acts as a ligand and forms a tetraamminecopper(II) complex with CuSO4. This complex formation effectively sequesters the Cu²⁺ ions so that the usual confirmatory tests for free Cu²⁺ do not occur.",

    "correct_answer": "A coordination entity is a complex in which a central metal ion is surrounded by a fixed number of ligands (e.g., [Co(NH3)6]³⁺, [Fe(CN)6]⁴⁻). A ligand is an ion or molecule that binds to the metal ion (e.g., H2O, NH3). The coordination number is the number of ligand donor atoms attached to the metal (e.g., 6 for [Co(NH3)6]³⁺, 4 for [Ni(CO)4]). A coordination polyhedron describes the spatial arrangement of these ligands (e.g., octahedral for [Co(NH3)6]³⁺, tetrahedral for [Ni(CO)4]). A homoleptic complex contains only one type of ligand (e.g., [Co(NH3)6]³⁺), while a heteroleptic complex contains more than one type of ligand (e.g., [Co(NH3)4Cl₂]⁺).",
    "explanation": "Each term is defined by the structure and composition of the complex.

Stereoisomerism includes geometrical isomerism (e.g., cis- and trans-[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂]) and optical isomerism (e.g., the enantiomers of [Co(en)₃]³⁺). Structural isomerism includes linkage isomerism (e.g., [Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]²⁺ where NO₂ can bind via N or O), coordination isomerism (e.g., [Co(NH₃)₆][Cr(CN)₆] versus [Cr(NH₃)₆][Co(CN)₆]), ionisation isomerism (e.g., [Co(NH₃)₅Br]SO₄ versus [Co(NH₃)₅SO₄]Br), and solvate isomerism (e.g., [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃ versus [Cr(H₂O)₅Cl]Cl₂·H₂O).",

In contrast, the addition of potassium chloride leads to ligand substitution forming [CuCl₄]²⁻, which is bright green in color.",
    "explanation": "The color changes are due to the formation of different copper complexes.

    "explanation": "Valence bond theory explains that the hybridization used by the metal ion depends on the nature of the ligand. Strong field ligands like CN⁻ induce electron pairing in the d orbitals and lead to inner orbital complex formation, while weak field ligands like F⁻ do not, resulting in outer orbital complex formation.

    "explanation": "The magnitude of Δₒ, which depends on the ability of the ligands to split the d orbital energies, is a key factor in deciding the electron configuration of the metal ion in the complex.

In [Fe(H₂O)₆]²⁺, the weaker field water ligands produce a smaller splitting, leading to transitions that absorb different wavelengths, resulting in a distinct color.",

This dual bonding interaction strengthens the metal–CO bond and weakens the C–O bond.",
    "explanation": "The synergic effect in metal carbonyls is the key to their stability and reactivity.

    "question_text": "Write down the IUPAC name for each of the following complexes and indicate the oxidation state, electronic configuration, coordination number, stereochemistry, and magnetic moment of the complex: (i) K[Cr(H₂O)₂(C₂O₄)₂]·3H₂O, (ii) [Co(NH₃)₅Cl]Cl₂, (iii) [CrCl₃(py)₃], (iv) Cs[FeCl₄], (v) K₄[Mn(CN)₆].",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(i) K[Cr(H₂O)₂(C₂O₄)₂]·3H₂O: Potassium di(aqua)bis(oxalato)chromate(III) trihydrate; Cr is +3 (d³), coordination number 6, octahedral; paramagnetic with 3 unpaired electrons. (ii) [Co(NH₃)₅Cl]Cl₂: Pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) chloride; Co is +3 (d⁶, low spin, diamagnetic), coordination number 6, octahedral. (iii) [CrCl₃(py)₃]: Trichlorido(trispyridine)chromium(III); Cr is +3 (d³), coordination number 6, octahedral, paramagnetic. (iv) Cs[FeCl₄]: Cesium tetrachloridoferrate(III); Fe is +3 (d⁵), coordination number 4, typically tetrahedral, high spin and paramagnetic. (v) K₄[Mn(CN)₆]: Potassium hexacyanomanganate(II); Mn is +2 (d⁵), coordination number 6, octahedral; CN⁻ is a strong field ligand so low spin may be expected, resulting in a low magnetic moment.",
    "explanation": "Each complex is named by identifying the ligands, the central metal ion, and its oxidation state. The electronic configuration is determined by subtracting the oxidation state from the atomic number, and the coordination number is based on the total number of donor atoms. Stereochemistry is deduced from the geometrical arrangement (e.g., octahedral, tetrahedral) and the magnetic moment is inferred from the number of unpaired electrons.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In [Ti(H₂O)₆]³⁺, titanium is in the +3 oxidation state with a d¹ configuration. In an octahedral crystal field, the single d electron occupies one of the lower-energy t₂g orbitals. Absorption of light promotes this electron to an e₉ orbital. The energy gap (Δₒ) corresponds to the absorption of light in the blue-green region, so the transmitted or reflected light appears violet.",
    "explanation": "Crystal field theory explains the color of coordination compounds by the d-d transition energy. For Ti³⁺ (d¹) in an octahedral field, the energy gap between the t₂g and e₉ levels causes the absorption of specific wavelengths, leaving the complementary violet color visible.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The chelate effect refers to the greater stability of coordination compounds in which the ligands are polydentate (e.g., bidentate) compared to similar compounds with equivalent numbers of monodentate ligands. An example is the enhanced stability of [Co(en)₃]³⁺ compared to a complex containing three monodentate ammine ligands.",
    "explanation": "Polydentate ligands form ring structures with the central metal ion, which increases the stability of the complex due to entropic and enthalpic factors. This effect is widely used in chelation therapy and various analytical applications.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In biological systems, coordination compounds are essential, as seen in hemoglobin (Fe complex) and chlorophyll (Mg complex). In medicinal chemistry, compounds like cisplatin are used as anticancer agents. In analytical chemistry, complex formation is utilized in titrations (e.g., EDTA titrations for Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ in water hardness analysis). In extraction and metallurgy, complexation plays a role in processes such as gold cyanidation, where gold forms the complex [Au(CN)₂]⁻.",
    "explanation": "Coordination compounds are integral to many fields because their ability to form stable complexes can be exploited for specific functions, such as oxygen transport in biology, targeted drug action in medicine, selective metal ion detection in analysis, and metal recovery in extraction and metallurgy.",

Since H₂O is a weak field ligand, [Ni(H₂O)₆]²⁺ has the smallest Δ and absorbs at the longest wavelength. NH₃ is a stronger field ligand than H₂O, so [Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺ absorbs at a shorter wavelength. NO₂⁻ is an even stronger field ligand, producing the largest splitting and thus absorbing at the shortest wavelength.",
