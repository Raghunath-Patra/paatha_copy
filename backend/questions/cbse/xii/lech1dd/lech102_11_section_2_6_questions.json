    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a lead storage battery is charged, the electrochemical reactions are reversed. At the anode, lead sulfate (PbSO₄) is converted back into lead (Pb), and at the cathode, PbSO₄ is converted back into lead dioxide (PbO₂). This reversal is achieved by applying an external current, forcing the electrons to move in the opposite direction of the discharging process. As a result, the battery recovers its ability to deliver electrical energy during subsequent discharge cycles.",
    "explanation": "During discharging, the anode reaction is Pb(s) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → PbSO₄(s) + 2e⁻, and the cathode reaction is PbO₂(s) + SO₄²⁻(aq) + 4H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → PbSO₄(s) + 2H₂O(l). Charging reverses these reactions, restoring the original electrode materials. The process relies on Faraday’s laws of electrolysis and illustrates the principle of reversible chemical reactions in secondary batteries.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Primary batteries use non-reversible redox reactions, which means they are designed for single-use and must be disposed of once exhausted. They are typically used in low-drain devices like clocks and remote controls. In contrast, secondary batteries use reversible reactions that can be recharged multiple times. This makes them suitable for applications requiring frequent cycling, such as in automobiles and electronic devices.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the reversibility of the chemical reaction. Primary batteries, such as the dry cell and mercury cell, sacrifice rechargeability for compactness and simplicity. Secondary batteries, like the lead storage and nickel-cadmium cells, invest in complex reversible chemistries to provide sustainable energy over many cycles. This evaluation is based on principles of electrochemistry and practical engineering requirements.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A hypothetical battery design could use a combination of a thin, lightweight metal anode with an optimized composite cathode incorporating transition metal oxides, similar to those found in dry cells. To maintain constant voltage, the design could include an electrolyte that minimizes concentration changes during discharge, such as a paste or gel, and incorporate buffering agents that stabilize ion concentrations. Additionally, using catalysts or electrode structures that provide a large surface area can help sustain a steady reaction rate. Such a design integrates principles from both primary and secondary battery technologies.",
    "explanation": "The approach relies on understanding that constant voltage is achieved by avoiding significant changes in ion concentration in the electrolyte. By using a gel or paste electrolyte and buffering agents, the battery can mitigate variations in voltage output. Incorporating high surface area electrodes further promotes uniform reaction kinetics, ensuring a more stable output over the battery's lifetime.",
