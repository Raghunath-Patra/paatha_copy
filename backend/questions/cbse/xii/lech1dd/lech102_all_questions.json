    "correct_answer": "For strong electrolytes, molar conductivity increases slowly with dilution because they are fully dissociated; the increase is mainly due to the increased volume of solution per mole of electrolyte. In contrast, for weak electrolytes, dilution causes a significant increase in molar conductivity because the degree of dissociation increases with dilution, leading to more ions per mole. At infinite dilution, weak electrolytes become fully dissociated, but the rise in molar conductivity with dilution is much steeper compared to strong electrolytes.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that while strong electrolytes show a modest increase in molar conductivity upon dilution (often represented linearly versus the square root of concentration), weak electrolytes exhibit a sharper increase due to the additional effect of increasing dissociation, which is quantified by the degree of dissociation (α).",

    "correct_answer": "By setting Ecell = 0 at equilibrium, the Nernst equation reduces to E°cell = (RT/nF) ln K, or in common logarithm form, E°cell = (2.303 RT/nF) log K. This equation shows that the standard cell potential is directly related to the logarithm of the equilibrium constant, allowing us to calculate difficult-to-measure equilibrium constants from standard potential measurements.",
    "explanation": "At equilibrium, the cell potential is zero. Starting from the Nernst equation: 0 = E°cell - (RT/nF) ln Q and recognizing that at equilibrium Q = K, rearranging gives E°cell = (RT/nF) ln K. Converting to base 10 logarithm using ln x = 2.303 log x leads to E°cell = (2.303 RT/nF) log K. This derivation is significant because it provides a method to determine the equilibrium constant (K) from the standard electrode potential, linking thermodynamics with electrochemical measurements.",

    "correct_answer": "Changes in ion concentrations affect the reaction quotient Q in the Nernst equation. For example, increasing Cu²⁺ concentration or decreasing Zn²⁺ concentration will increase the cell potential since the term ln([Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺]) decreases. Temperature also plays a role since the factor (RT/nF) in the Nernst equation will increase with temperature, amplifying the impact of concentration changes on cell potential.",
    "explanation": "According to the Nernst equation, Ecell = E°cell - (RT/nF) ln([Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺]). When [Cu²⁺] increases, the ratio [Zn²⁺]/[Cu²⁺] decreases, resulting in a lower value of the logarithmic term and hence a higher cell potential. Conversely, an increase in [Zn²⁺] raises the value of the logarithmic term, decreasing the cell potential. Additionally, an increase in temperature (T) raises the (RT/nF) factor, meaning that for the same change in concentration, the potential change will be more pronounced at higher temperatures.",

    "correct_answer": "When a lead storage battery is charged, the electrochemical reactions are reversed. At the anode, lead sulfate (PbSO₄) is converted back into lead (Pb), and at the cathode, PbSO₄ is converted back into lead dioxide (PbO₂). This reversal is achieved by applying an external current, forcing the electrons to move in the opposite direction of the discharging process. As a result, the battery recovers its ability to deliver electrical energy during subsequent discharge cycles.",
    "explanation": "During discharging, the anode reaction is Pb(s) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → PbSO₄(s) + 2e⁻, and the cathode reaction is PbO₂(s) + SO₄²⁻(aq) + 4H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → PbSO₄(s) + 2H₂O(l).

They are typically used in low-drain devices like clocks and remote controls. In contrast, secondary batteries use reversible reactions that can be recharged multiple times. This makes them suitable for applications requiring frequent cycling, such as in automobiles and electronic devices.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the reversibility of the chemical reaction. Primary batteries, such as the dry cell and mercury cell, sacrifice rechargeability for compactness and simplicity. Secondary batteries, like the lead storage and nickel-cadmium cells, invest in complex reversible chemistries to provide sustainable energy over many cycles.

    "correct_answer": "A hypothetical battery design could use a combination of a thin, lightweight metal anode with an optimized composite cathode incorporating transition metal oxides, similar to those found in dry cells. To maintain constant voltage, the design could include an electrolyte that minimizes concentration changes during discharge, such as a paste or gel, and incorporate buffering agents that stabilize ion concentrations. Additionally, using catalysts or electrode structures that provide a large surface area can help sustain a steady reaction rate. Such a design integrates principles from both primary and secondary battery technologies.",
    "explanation": "The approach relies on understanding that constant voltage is achieved by avoiding significant changes in ion concentration in the electrolyte. By using a gel or paste electrolyte and buffering agents, the battery can mitigate variations in voltage output. Incorporating high surface area electrodes further promotes uniform reaction kinetics, ensuring a more stable output over the battery's lifetime.",

Since Λₘ is defined as the conductivity of the solution per mole of substance (Λₘ = κ/V, where V is the volume containing one mole of the substance), and knowing that pure water has a concentration of about 55.5 mol/L, one can compute Λₘ.

    "correct_answer": "No. When a zinc pot is used to store copper sulphate solution, a redox reaction occurs in which zinc (being a strong reducing agent with a very negative standard electrode potential) is oxidized to Zn²⁺ while Cu²⁺ ions are reduced to deposit copper metal on the pot.",
    "explanation": "The standard electrode potentials indicate that the copper half-cell has a more positive potential compared to the zinc half-cell. This means copper ions have a greater tendency to be reduced while zinc is easily oxidized. As described in the section on galvanic cells, the reaction between zinc metal and copper sulphate will lead to the deposition of copper and dissolution of zinc, thereby contaminating the solution.",

    "correct_answer": "Three substances that can oxidise ferrous ions (Fe²⁺) are fluorine gas (F₂), the permanganate ion (MnO₄⁻) in acidic solution, and the dichromate ion (Cr₂O₇²⁻).",
    "explanation": "In a table of standard electrode potentials, the strength of an oxidising agent is indicated by the more positive (or highest) reduction potential. The section highlights that fluorine gas has the highest standard electrode potential, making it an excellent oxidising agent. Similarly, species like MnO₄⁻ and Cr₂O₇²⁻ possess high reduction potentials under acidic conditions, thus they can effectively oxidise Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ when used under suitable conditions.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "During recharging, the discharging reaction of the lead storage battery is reversed. In discharge, the overall reaction is: Pb(s) + PbO₂(s) + 2H₂SO₄(aq) → 2PbSO₄(s) + 2H₂O(l). When the battery is recharged, electrical energy is used to drive the reverse reaction: 2PbSO₄(s) + 2H₂O(l) → Pb(s) + PbO₂(s) + 2H₂SO₄(aq). This process regenerates the active materials on the electrodes (lead at the anode and lead dioxide at the cathode) and restores the sulfuric acid electrolyte.",
    "explanation": "Recharging a lead storage battery involves applying an external current to reverse the chemical changes that occur during discharge. In the discharging phase, lead and lead dioxide react with sulfuric acid to form lead sulfate and water. The recharging process converts lead sulfate back into lead and lead dioxide while regenerating the sulfuric acid. This reversal of reactions maintains the battery’s ability to deliver electrical energy, and the key materials involved are Pb, PbO₂, PbSO₄, H₂O, and H₂SO₄. This concept is discussed under the section on Secondary Batteries.",

    "question_text": "Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an electrochemical cell.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Rusting of iron involves the spontaneous establishment of anodic and cathodic regions on the iron surface. At the anodic spots, iron is oxidized to Fe²⁺ by losing electrons (Fe(s) → Fe²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻). These electrons migrate through the metal to cathodic regions where they reduce oxygen, typically in the presence of water and H⁺, forming water (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O). This separation of charge creates a potential difference that drives the corrosion process, effectively setting up an electrochemical cell on the metal surface.",
    "explanation": "Rusting is essentially an electrochemical process. Localized areas on the surface of iron act as anodes where oxidation occurs, while other areas act as cathodes where a reduction reaction, often involving oxygen and water, takes place. These simultaneous reactions result in the flow of electrons from the anodic region to the cathodic region, similar to a galvanic cell. The overall electrochemical reaction helps explain why rusting occurs continuously when iron is exposed to moist air. This concept is detailed in the section on Corrosion.",
