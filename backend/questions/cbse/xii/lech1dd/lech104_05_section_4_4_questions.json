It also oxidizes iodide ions to iodine, and hydrogen sulphide (or sulphide ions) is oxidized with elemental sulphur being produced. These reactions occur by the reduction of dichromate ion and the simultaneous oxidation of the reducing agent.",
    "explanation": "Each reaction involves specific half-reactions. For ferrous ion oxidation, the reduction of Cr₂O₇²⁻ is coupled with the oxidation of Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺. In the case of iodide, dichromate oxidizes I⁻ to I₂, and for hydrogen sulphide, oxidation yields elemental sulphur.

    "correct_answer": "Potassium dichromate is prepared by fusing chromite ore with carbonate followed by acidification and precipitation, while potassium permanganate is produced by the alkaline oxidative fusion of MnO₂ and subsequent electrolytic oxidation. Structurally, the dichromate ion has two tetrahedrally coordinated chromium atoms linked by a bridging oxygen with a Cr–O–Cr bond angle of 126°, whereas the permanganate ion is a single tetrahedral unit with manganese in the center. Redox potentials differ, with dichromate exhibiting a high oxidizing power in acid (E° = 1.33 V for Cr₂O₇²⁻ reduction) and permanganate showing variable redox behavior depending on the pH of the medium. These differences influence their analytical applications: potassium dichromate is used as a primary standard in volumetric analysis, while potassium permanganate is favored as an oxidant in both qualitative and quantitative organic and inorganic reactions.",
