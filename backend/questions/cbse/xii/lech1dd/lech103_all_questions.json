    "explanation": "For each rate expression, the overall order is the exponent on the concentration term. In (i) and (ii) the exponents sum to 2 so the reaction is second order, and for a second‐order reaction (with rate in mol·L⁻¹·s⁻¹) the rate constant has units L·mol⁻¹·s⁻¹. In (iii) the only concentration term is raised to the 3/2 power, so the reaction is 1.5 order and the corresponding k must compensate dimensionally: (mol·L⁻¹)^(3/2) multiplied by k gives mol·L⁻¹·s⁻¹, yielding k with units L^(0.5)·mol^(–0.5)·s⁻¹.

    "explanation": "For a first order reaction, 99.9% completion means only 0.1% of the reactant remains. Using ln ([R]0/[R]) = k t and noting that [R]0/[R] = 1000, we have t = ln 1000/k. Since one half-life is t½ = 0.693/k, dividing gives t/t½ = ln 1000/0.693 ≈ 6.908/0.693 ≈ 9.97, which is approximately 10 half-lives.

Similarly, when the concentration of O2 is doubled (with NO constant), the rate doubles, indicating a first order dependence on O2. Therefore, the overall rate law is Rate = k [NO]² [O2].
