    "correct_answer": "The pairing energy (P) is the energy required to pair two electrons in the same orbital. For a d4 ion, if the crystal field splitting energy (Δo) is less than the pairing energy, the fourth electron enters the higher energy eg orbital, resulting in a high spin complex. Conversely, if Δo exceeds P, the electron pairs in the t2g orbital, leading to a low spin complex.",
    "explanation": "In d4 complexes, the decision of whether the electron will pair in the t2g level or occupy an eg orbital depends on the balance between Δo and P. With weak field ligands (small Δo) the cost of pairing is higher than promoting the electron, hence a high spin configuration results. Strong field ligands have a larger Δo and favor electron pairing, resulting in a low spin state.",

It relies on several assumptions, does not quantitatively explain magnetic data, fails to account for the colour exhibited by complexes, and cannot precisely predict the thermodynamic or kinetic stabilities. Also, VBT does not effectively differentiate between weak and strong field ligands or accurately choose between tetrahedral and square planar structures for four-coordinate complexes.",
    "explanation": "While VBT is useful for understanding the geometry and formation of bonds in coordination compounds via hybridization, it oversimplifies bonding by not considering the delocalization of electrons and covalent character.

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The colour of [Ti(H₂O)₆]³+ arises due to the absorption of light that corresponds to the energy gap between the t2g and eg orbitals in an octahedral field. In the Ti³+ ion (a d1 system), the single electron normally occupies a t2g orbital. When white light passes through the solution, the energy matching the crystal field splitting (Δo) promotes the electron from the t2g level to the eg level. The absorbed wavelength typically falls in the blue-green region, and the observed colour is the complementary violet.",
    "explanation": "In [Ti(H₂O)₆]³+, the octahedral geometry splits the degeneracy of the d orbitals into the lower energy t2g and higher energy eg sets. The d-d transition, specifically from t2g to eg, requires energy equal to Δo. As blue-green light is absorbed for this transition, the complementary colour transmitted by the complex is violet, which is what we observe.",

    "correct_answer": "Valence Bond Theory explains the magnetic properties of coordination compounds based on the use of inner versus outer orbital hybridizations, determining electron pairing and subsequently paramagnetism or diamagnetism. However, it does not quantitatively correlate with the observed magnetic moments. In contrast, Crystal Field Theory provides a quantitative approach by considering the electrostatic interactions between the metal ion and ligands leading to d-orbital splitting. This splitting allows for the prediction of electron distributions (high spin or low spin configurations) and therefore more accurate calculations of magnetic moments.",
    "explanation": "VBT uses hybridization concepts to qualitatively deduce whether electrons are paired, which helps in predicting magnetic behavior but lacks detail for numeric predictions. CFT, with its treatment of ligand fields lifting the degeneracy of d orbitals into t2g and eg sets, can predict the exact number of unpaired electrons based on the energies involved relative to pairing energy. This quantitative aspect makes CFT more reliable for explaining the magnetic properties such as paramagnetism or diamagnetism in coordination compounds.",
