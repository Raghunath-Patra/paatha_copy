    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electrorefining of copper involves using impure copper as the anode and pure copper as the cathode immersed in a copper sulphate solution. At the anode, impure copper is oxidized: Cu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻, and at the cathode, copper ions are reduced: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). This process removes impurities, as less noble metals remain in solution or form anode sludge, while pure copper is deposited onto the cathode.",
    "explanation": "The electrorefining process purifies copper by exploiting the redox properties of copper. The impure anode dissolves to release Cu²⁺ ions into the solution, and these ions are reduced at the cathode to form high purity copper.

    "correct_answer": "In molten NaCl, only Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are present, so at the cathode Na⁺ is reduced to sodium metal (Na) and at the anode Cl⁻ is oxidized to chlorine gas (Cl₂). In contrast, aqueous NaCl contains water which undergoes electrolysis. At the cathode, water is reduced to hydrogen gas (H₂) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻) are produced, while at the anode, either chloride ions are oxidized to chlorine gas (Cl₂) or water is oxidized to oxygen gas (O₂) depending on the conditions and overpotential. Ultimately, the aqueous process yields NaOH in solution, coupled with the evolution of H₂ and Cl₂.",
    "explanation": "The presence of water in aqueous NaCl introduces additional species (H₂O, H⁺, OH⁻) that participate in electrode reactions. This results in competitive reactions at both electrodes. In molten NaCl, the reaction is straightforward because only the salt's ions are present, leading directly to the formation of Na and Cl₂.",
