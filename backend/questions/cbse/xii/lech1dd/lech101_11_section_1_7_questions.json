    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Association in weak organic acids occurs when molecules interact through hydrogen bonding to form dimers or higher aggregates. In the case of benzoic acid in benzene, dimerization leads to fewer particles in the solution. This lowers the degree of freezing point depression compared to what is expected if no association occurred. When the molar mass is calculated based on this reduced freezing point depression, it appears to be roughly twice the expected molar mass. Detailed analysis shows that as benzoic acid associates, the number of solute particles reduces, and the van't Hoff factor becomes less than unity, indicating a high degree of association.",
    "explanation": "The equilibrium between monomer and dimer shifts towards the dimer due to hydrogen bonding in benzene, a solvent with a low dielectric constant. As a result, the effective number of solute particles is reduced, leading to a smaller depression in the freezing point than expected from the formula mass. When colligative property data is used to calculate the molar mass, the value comes out higher since fewer particles are contributing to the effect. This phenomenon is a classic example of abnormal molar mass due to association.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Dissociation increases the number of particles in solution, reducing the observed molar mass compared to the true molar mass, because each formula unit produces multiple ions (e.g., KCl dissociating into K⁺ and Cl⁻). Association, on the other hand, decreases the number of particles in solution, making the observed molar mass appear higher than the true molar mass (e.g., benzoic acid dimerizing in benzene). The van't Hoff factor, i, mathematically accounts for these deviations by representing the ratio of particles present after association or dissociation to the number of formula units originally added. For instance, an i value of nearly 2 for KCl confirms dissociation into two particles, while an i value of around 0.5 for benzoic acid in benzene indicates strong association.",
    "explanation": "By incorporating i into colligative property equations, one can adjust the expected results to match experimental data, thereby accurately determining the true molar mass. Specifically, when i > 1, dissociation is indicated, and when i < 1, association is evident. This helps in correctly interpreting the experimental colligative data.",

Each term represents: i corrects for dissociation or association, n2 reflects the moles of solute added, R is the proportionality constant, T indicates the thermal energy available, and V is the solvent volume over which the solute is distributed. Deviations in i are important because they reveal whether the solute undergoes significant dissociation or association, which in turn affects all colligative properties.",
    "explanation": "The van't Hoff factor is critical in accurately predicting osmotic pressure since the number of actual particles in solution may be different from the number originally dissolved.
