    "explanation": "The derivation starts by applying Raoult's law to each component.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In liquid-liquid solutions, both components are volatile, and their partial vapor pressures are given by p = x × p°. The total vapor pressure is a weighted sum of the pure vapor pressures and varies linearly with mole fraction, as described by Raoult's law. In contrast, solutions of solids in liquids involve a nonvolatile solute which does not contribute to vapor pressure. Here, the addition of the solute reduces the number of solvent molecules at the surface, thereby lowering the vapor pressure relative to the pure solvent. This reduction is a colligative property, depending only on the amount of solute and not its identity.",
    "explanation": "The key difference is that in liquid-liquid solutions all components evaporate contributing to the total vapor pressure, whereas in solutions of solids in liquids, only the solvent contributes. The presence of a nonvolatile solute leads to a relative lowering of the vapor pressure which is independent of the solute's chemical nature, highlighting a colligative property.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a binary solution, Raoult’s law tells us that the partial vapor pressure of a component is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid phase. The more volatile component has a higher pure vapor pressure (p°), so even if its mole fraction is the same as the less volatile one, its partial pressure is higher. Dalton’s law, which states that the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures, implies that since the more volatile component contributes a higher partial pressure, it will be more represented in the vapor phase. Thus, the vapor phase is enriched in the more volatile component.",
    "explanation": "By applying Raoult’s law (p = x × p°) for both components, the component with a higher p° produces a larger partial pressure. Dalton’s law confirms the composition of the vapor phase is determined by the individual partial pressures. Consequently, the vapor phase contains a higher mole fraction of the component with the higher p°.",
