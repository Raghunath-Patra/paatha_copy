Using the boundary condition that at t = 0, [R] = [R]0, we find C = ln [R]0. Thus, the integrated rate law is ln [R] = -k t + ln [R]0, or equivalently ln ([R]/[R]0) = -k t.",

Alternative methods include the method of initial rates, isolation experiments, and spectroscopic monitoring that can provide more continuous and precise data.",
    "explanation": "While integrated rate laws provide a clear mathematical relationship between concentration and time, practical challenges include isolating the small changes in concentration accurately, especially at low concentrations or short time intervals. Experimental uncertainties, side reactions, and changes in reaction conditions can also affect the reliability of the slope obtained from concentration versus time plots.

    "correct_answer": "A pseudo first order reaction occurs when one reactant is in such excess that its concentration remains nearly constant during the reaction. For example, in the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate, water is present in large excess. Although the reaction is inherently second order (depending on both ethyl acetate and water), the constant concentration of water allows the reaction to effectively behave as first order with respect to ethyl acetate.",
    "explanation": "With water in large excess, its concentration changes negligibly during the course of the reaction. Thus, the rate law which originally depends on both reactants simplifies to Rate = k' [ethyl acetate] where k' = k[water].
