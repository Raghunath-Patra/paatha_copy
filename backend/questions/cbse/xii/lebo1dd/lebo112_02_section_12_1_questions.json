    "correct_answer": "Unidirectional energy flow means that energy moves from primary producers to higher trophic levels with each transfer losing energy primarily as heat. This process limits the number of trophic levels in an ecosystem because only a fraction of energy is available at each successive level. As a result, top predators receive much less energy, which restricts their population sizes and overall impact compared to primary producers.",
