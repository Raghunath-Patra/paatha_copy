    "correct_answer": "Natural selection leads to new species formation when variations that are beneficial in a changing environment become dominant in a population over successive generations.

    "correct_answer": "Darwinian evolution is based on natural selection, where genetic variations that enhance survival and reproduction are passed on, leading to gradual change over generations. In contrast, Lamarck's theory involves the inheritance of acquired characteristics, where traits developed during an organism's lifetime (such as a giraffe's elongated neck) are transmitted to offspring. Modern genetics supports Darwin’s view, as acquired traits do not typically alter the genetic code passed to the next generation.",

    "correct_answer": "Inherited variation is central to adaptation because it provides the raw material upon which natural selection acts. Variations that increase an organism's fitness in a particular environment are more likely to be passed on. Over many generations, these advantageous traits accumulate, leading to a shift in the overall characteristics of the population, and eventually giving rise to new species. This process highlights how continuous environmental pressures and genetic diversity drive evolutionary change.",
