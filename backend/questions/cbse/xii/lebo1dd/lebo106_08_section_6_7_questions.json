    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Natural selection alters allele frequencies by favoring certain phenotypes that are more adapted to the environment. Stabilizing selection reduces variation by eliminating extreme phenotypes, maintaining the mean. Directional selection shifts the population's traits toward one extreme, while disruptive selection favors extreme phenotypes over intermediate forms, potentially leading to a bimodal distribution. Over time, these selective pressures can lead to significant changes in the gene pool, thereby driving the process of evolution.",

Natural selection then acts on these variations, favoring traits that enhance survival and reproduction. When these processes lead to significant differences in allele frequencies, isolated populations can diverge enough to form distinct species, a process known as speciation.",

    "correct_answer": "The equation p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 is fundamental in population genetics as it quantifies the expected distribution of genotypes in a population under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. It provides a baseline to detect whether evolutionary forces such as natural selection, gene flow, or genetic drift are acting on the population. Any deviation from this equation signals that one or more of these forces are influencing the gene pool.",
