    "correct_answer": "Spermatogenesis begins at puberty and occurs continuously, producing four equal haploid spermatids from each primary spermatocyte; it involves rapid mitotic and meiotic divisions with minimal cytoplasmic division. In contrast, oogenesis begins during embryonic development, is halted at prophase-I and fully resumes later at puberty. It produces one large secondary oocyte and small polar bodies through unequal cytokinesis, conserving cytoplasm for the eventual ovum. Moreover, while spermatogenesis leads to multiple gametes per cycle, oogenesis typically produces one functional gamete per cycle.",
