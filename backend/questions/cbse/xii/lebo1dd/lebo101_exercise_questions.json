    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The anther (where male gametophytes or pollen grains develop) and the ovary (which contains the ovules where the female gametophyte develops).",
    "explanation": "In angiosperms, the male gametophyte develops within the anther of the stamen, while the female gametophyte develops within the ovule located in the ovary. This fundamental division of reproductive structures is crucial for sexual reproduction in flowering plants.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Microsporogenesis is the process by which pollen mother cells in the anther undergo meiotic division to form microspore tetrads, which subsequently develop into pollen grains (male gametophytes). In contrast, megasporogenesis is the process by which the megaspore mother cell in the ovule undergoes meiosis to form a megaspore tetrad, from which one functional megaspore develops into the embryo sac (female gametophyte). The cell division common to both processes is meiosis.",
    "explanation": "Both microsporogenesis and megasporogenesis involve a reduction division (meiosis) that results in the formation of haploid cells. In microsporogenesis, the end product is a microspore tetrad that eventually gives rise to mature pollen grains. In megasporogenesis, although a tetrad is initially formed, usually only one megaspore survives and develops into the embryo sac.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sporogenous tissue → Pollen mother cell → Microspore tetrad → Pollen grain → Male gametes",
    "explanation": "The development of the male gametophyte begins with the sporogenous tissue, which differentiates into pollen mother cells. These cells undergo meiosis to form microspore tetrads. The microspores then mature into pollen grains, and finally, pollen grains give rise to male gametes.",

    "correct_answer": "A typical angiosperm ovule consists of a funicle (stalk attaching the ovule to the placenta), a hilum (the junction between the ovule and funicle), one or two integuments (protective envelopes), a micropyle (an opening at the tip for pollen entry), a chalaza (the basal part opposite the micropyle), a nucellus (nutritive tissue), and the embryo sac (female gametophyte).",
    "explanation": "The ovule is the megasporangium and is essential for the development of the female gametophyte. Each part of the ovule has a specific function, such as protection (integuments), nutrient storage (nucellus), and facilitating fertilization (micropyle).

    "explanation": "During megasporogenesis in most flowering plants, although four megaspores are initially produced, only one survives. This single megaspore undergoes mitotic divisions to form the embryo sac, leading to monosporic development.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "The female gametophyte starts as a functional megaspore that undergoes three successive rounds of free-nuclear mitosis, forming a structure with eight nuclei. Subsequently, cell walls partition these nuclei into seven cells: one egg cell, two synergids (forming the egg apparatus), three antipodal cells, and a large central cell containing two polar nuclei.",
    "explanation": "The process involves free nuclear divisions before cytokinesis occurs. The final spatial arrangement is crucial for successful double fertilization, where the egg apparatus and the polar nuclei play their roles in forming the zygote and the endosperm, respectively.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Chasmogamous flowers are open, well-developed flowers that facilitate cross-pollination by exposing their reproductive structures. Cleistogamous flowers are closed and self-pollinate, making cross-pollination unlikely because the anthers and stigma are positioned very close together, preventing the entry of foreign pollen.",
    "explanation": "Chasmogamous flowers attract pollinators and allow pollen from different plants to fertilize the ovule, increasing genetic diversity. In contrast, cleistogamous flowers remain closed, ensuring that the pollen transfers to the stigma within the same flower, thus excluding cross-pollination.",

    "correct_answer": "Temporal separation of pollen release and stigma receptivity (dichogamy) and spatial separation of the anthers and stigma (herkogamy) are two strategies to prevent self-pollination. Additionally, self-incompatibility is a genetic mechanism that prevents fertilization by self-pollen.",
    "explanation": "These strategies ensure that self-pollen does not fertilize the ovules, thereby promoting cross-pollination, which enhances genetic diversity and reduces the chances of inbreeding depression.",

    "correct_answer": "Self-incompatibility is a genetic mechanism by which a plant’s pistil can recognize and reject its own pollen or pollen from genetically similar individuals. In self-incompatible species, self-pollination does not lead to seed formation because the pistil prevents pollen germination or pollen tube growth, thereby stopping fertilization.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Triple fusion is the process in double fertilization where one of the male gametes fuses with the two polar nuclei in the central cell of the embryo sac to form a triploid primary endosperm nucleus. This fusion takes place inside the ovule immediately after the pollen tube enters and delivers the male gametes.",
    "explanation": "In double fertilization, one sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to form the diploid zygote (syngamy), while the other sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei to produce the triploid primary endosperm nucleus, which later develops into the endosperm to nourish the embryo.",

    "correct_answer": "The zygote remains dormant initially to allow time for the primary endosperm to develop and accumulate nutrients necessary for supporting the subsequent development of the embryo.",
    "explanation": "This dormancy ensures that the embryo has adequate nutritional support from the endosperm once it resumes active cell division and growth. It is an adaptive strategy to enhance the chances of successful embryogenesis.",

The term 'testa' specifically refers to the hardened seed coat. d) Perisperm is tissue derived from the nucellus that persists in the mature seed, while the pericarp is the ovary wall that develops into the fruit.",

    "correct_answer": "Fruits such as banana and citrus can be selected for inducing parthenocarpy because they are commercially important and consumers generally prefer seedless varieties. For instance, bananas are typically parthenocarpic and seedless, and inducing parthenocarpy in citrus can lead to seedless, market-preferred fruits.",
    "explanation": "Parthenocarpy, the formation of fruit without fertilization, results in seedless fruits. This is highly desirable in commercial fruit production because it enhances consumer appeal and reduces the need for pollination.
