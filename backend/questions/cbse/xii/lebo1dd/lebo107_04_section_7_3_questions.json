    "correct_answer": "HIV enters the body and infects macrophages first, where its RNA genome is converted into viral DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This viral DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's genome. The infected macrophages become a factory for producing more viruses. Additionally, HIV infects helper T lymphocytes, and as these cells produce new viral progeny, their numbers progressively decline. The reduction in helper T cells weakens the immune system, making the individual more susceptible to other infections.",

Organizations like NACO, NGOs, and WHO have implemented various programs to educate and prevent further spread. These measures are effective if widely adopted because they address both the behavioral causes and the medical aspects of transmission. However, their success depends largely on public awareness, adherence to guidelines, and the cooperation of communities and medical institutions.",
