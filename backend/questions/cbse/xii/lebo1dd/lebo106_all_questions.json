    "correct_answer": "Antibiotic resistance arises when random genetic variations in bacteria allow some individuals to survive in the presence of antibiotics. These survivors reproduce and pass on the resistant traits, leading to a population dominated by resistant bacteria.",
    "explanation": "Under Darwinian selection, environmental pressures such as antibiotic use favor bacteria with mutations that confer resistance. As these resistant bacteria multiply, the overall population becomes less susceptible to the antibiotic, demonstrating natural selection in action.",

As the universe expanded and cooled, hydrogen and helium formed and later condensed under gravitational forces to create galaxies. Within one of these galaxies, the Milky Way, the Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Initially, the Earth had no atmosphere, but volcanic activity released gases like water vapour, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. UV light broke water into hydrogen and oxygen, leading to the formation of the ozone layer. Rainfall subsequently filled depressions to form oceans. Approximately 500 million years after Earth's formation, life began, first as non-cellular self-replicating metabolic capsules and eventually evolving into cellular forms about 2 billion years ago.",

However, the theory of chemical evolution, supported by experiments like Miller’s, shows that organic molecules can form under early Earth conditions. Based on current evidence, chemical evolution appears more plausible because it provides a stepwise mechanism from inorganic compounds to the simplest self-replicating entities, even though the exact process by which life began remains unknown.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Adaptive radiation in both Darwin's finches and Australian marsupials involves the diversification of species from a common ancestor to adapt to different ecological niches. In Darwin's finches, variations in beak shape evolved to exploit different food sources on the Galapagos Islands, while in Australian marsupials, different species adapted to a variety of ecological roles within the Australian continent. Although both show diversification as a response to environmental challenges, the finches illustrate microevolutionary changes in a relatively contained area, whereas marsupials reflect broader morphological and ecological adaptations within a larger geographic region.",

The finch diagram illustrates how different beak shapes are favored in different environments, and the marsupial diagram shows a clear radiation from a common ancestor adapting to various niches. Together, these visuals support the concept that natural selection drives diversity by favoring beneficial traits that improve survival and reproductive success in different ecological contexts.",

    "correct_answer": "Convergent evolution supports the theory of natural selection by demonstrating that similar environmental pressures can lead to the development of similar adaptive features in unrelated species. For example, the diagrams show that both placental mammals and Australian marsupials have evolved analogous characteristics, such as similar body shapes and functional adaptations, despite having different ancestral lineages. This parallel adaptation indicates that natural selection independently favored traits that best suited similar ecological roles, providing robust evidence for its role in shaping biodiversity.",
