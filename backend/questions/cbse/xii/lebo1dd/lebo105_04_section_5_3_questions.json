    "correct_answer": "The transition from RNA to DNA involved a shift from an unstable, reactive genetic material to a more stable one. RNA, despite its crucial role in catalysis and information storage, was prone to degradation.

This evolutionary innovation ensured that genetic information could be maintained accurately over time.",

    "correct_answer": "The semiconservative model of DNA replication involves the unwinding of the double helix to form a replication fork where each original strand serves as a template for synthesizing a new complementary strand. This process ensures that each daughter molecule contains one original and one newly synthesized strand, preserving the genetic information. The directionality labeled as 5' and 3' plays a crucial role in guiding the replication, and the complementary base pairing (A with T and G with C) further minimizes errors and facilitates repair mechanisms.",
