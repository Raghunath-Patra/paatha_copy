    "correct_answer": "The energy pyramid illustrates that solar energy is captured by producers, but only a small percentage (about 1%) is converted into net primary production. This limited energy is then transferred to primary consumers, and further decreases with each subsequent trophic level due to metabolic processes and loss of energy as heat. Thus, by the time energy reaches tertiary consumers, only a minimal amount remains. The inefficiency of energy transfer limits the number of trophic levels that can be supported within an ecosystem.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains the concept of diminishing energy return as one moves up the trophic levels. It ties in the conversion efficiency of sun energy by producers and the metabolic losses incurred at each trophic transition.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Unidirectional energy flow means that energy moves from primary producers to higher trophic levels with each transfer losing energy primarily as heat. This process limits the number of trophic levels in an ecosystem because only a fraction of energy is available at each successive level. As a result, top predators receive much less energy, which restricts their population sizes and overall impact compared to primary producers.",

Each pond's productivity can be measured by monitoring biomass production, photosynthetic rates, and growth of primary producers over time. Controls without added nutrients, as well as replicates for statistical reliability, should be included. Data comparing nutrient levels, growth rates, and decomposition rates will help evaluate the role of nutrient cycling.",
