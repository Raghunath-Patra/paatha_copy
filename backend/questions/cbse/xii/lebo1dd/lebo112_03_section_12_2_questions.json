    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Solar energy is the fundamental energy source that drives ecosystem productivity. In primary producers, solar energy is captured during photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic matter, forming the basis of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). Not all captured energy is available because part is used by plants during respiration, resulting in Net Primary Productivity (NPP). This NPP represents the biomass that heterotrophs, including herbivores and decomposers, can consume. Secondary productivity is the rate at which this organic matter is converted by consumers into new tissue, driving the energy flow through trophic levels.",

Moreover, the physical structure of marine environments and the nature of aquatic photosynthetic organisms influence the overall productivity.",
