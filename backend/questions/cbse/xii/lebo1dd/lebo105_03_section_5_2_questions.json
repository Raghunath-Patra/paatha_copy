    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "DNA is more stable due to its double-stranded structure, lack of a reactive 2'-OH group, and the presence of thymine instead of uracil, all of which reduce its chemical reactivity. These features allow DNA to serve as a stable repository for genetic information. In contrast, RNA is single-stranded, contains ribose with a 2'-OH group making it more prone to hydrolysis, and is designed to be reactive, facilitating its role in messenger and adapter functions.",
    "explanation": "The contrasting chemical and structural properties of DNA and RNA underlie their different roles; DNA’s stability ensures faithful transmission of genetic information through generations, while RNA’s dynamic nature allows it to participate directly in protein synthesis and gene regulation.",
