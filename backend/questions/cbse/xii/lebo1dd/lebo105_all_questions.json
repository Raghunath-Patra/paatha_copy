During initiation, the sigma factor associates with RNA polymerase to help recognize and bind to the promoter region. In elongation, RNA polymerase synthesizes the RNA in the 5' to 3' direction, moving along the DNA template. During termination, the rho factor (if involved) aids in dislodging the RNA polymerase from the DNA at a terminator sequence, releasing the newly synthesized RNA.

This binding prevents RNA polymerase from accessing the promoter and transcribing the operon genes. Once an inducer, such as lactose or its isomer allolactose, is present, it binds to the repressor. This binding causes a conformational change in the repressor, making it unable to bind to the operator. Consequently, RNA polymerase is free to bind to the promoter and transcribe the genes, leading to the production of enzymes required for lactose metabolism.",

    "correct_answer": "The presence of lactose leads to the formation of an inducer (allolactose) that binds to the lac repressor, thereby inactivating it. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and transcribe the lac operon, which is crucial for lactose metabolism. Conversely, the absence of glucose removes the repression that would typically be exerted by glucose-mediated regulatory pathways (such as catabolite repression), facilitating a higher level of lac operon transcription. Thus, when lactose is present and glucose is absent, E. coli efficiently expresses enzymes needed for lactose utilization.",

Additionally, mutational analysis can be conducted where the repressor binding site (operator) or the repressor gene itself is altered, to study the effects on gene expression. The role of inducers can be examined by adding lactose or allolactose analogs and observing changes in reporter activity, while using repressor mutants will diminish the regulation allowing insights into negative regulation mechanisms.",

    "correct_answer": "Meselson and Stahl first grew E. coli in a medium containing 15N, a heavy isotope, so that the DNA became heavy. After transferring the cells into a medium with 14N and sampling the DNA at various time intervals, they used CsCl density gradient centrifugation to separate the DNA molecules. After one generation, all DNA showed an intermediate (hybrid) density, indicating that each DNA molecule consisted of one heavy and one light strand. In subsequent generations, a mix of hybrid and light DNA molecules was observed, confirming that each new molecule resulted from one old (template) strand and one newly synthesized strand, which supports the semiconservative model.",

    "correct_answer": "Replicating long DNA molecules poses challenges such as the impracticality of separating the entire double helix at once due to high energy requirements. Cells overcome this by creating a replication fork, a small open region where the strands are unwound and only a portion of the molecule is replicated at any one time. Additionally, the antiparallel nature of the DNA necessitates that one strand (the lagging strand) be synthesized discontinuously in short fragments, which are later joined by DNA ligase. A coordinated assembly of multiple enzymes, including DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and ligases, ensures both speed and high accuracy in replication.",
