Unlike Mendel's work, which was purely based on phenotypic ratios from controlled crosses, Morgan's findings showed that genes located on the same chromosome were linked and did not assort independently. This realignment of genetic observations with the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis validated and extended Mendel's principles, leading to the chromosomal theory of inheritance.",
