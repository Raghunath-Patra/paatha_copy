    "correct_answer": "Natural/traditional methods, such as periodic abstinence, rely on timing intercourse to avoid the fertile window and generally have no side effects but may result in higher failure rates. Barrier methods, like condoms and diaphragms, physically prevent sperm from reaching the ovum, offer additional protection against STIs, and have lower failure rates, though they require correct usage and sometimes may cause minor discomfort or allergic reactions.",
    "explanation": "Natural or traditional methods depend solely on behavioral changes and timing, and while they pose no medicinal side effects, their effectiveness is limited by the predictability of ovulation. Barrier methods provide a physical obstruction and additional health benefits (e.g., protection against STIs), but require proper application to maximize their efficiency.",

    "correct_answer": "Government policies, such as raising the marriageable age for females and males and providing incentives for smaller families, play a crucial role in population stabilization by delaying the onset of reproduction and encouraging practices that limit the number of children per family.

    "correct_answer": "Assisted reproductive technologies offer infertile couples a chance to conceive when natural conception is not possible. Advantages include the possibility of addressing underlying infertility issues, technological advances that help bypass certain biological barriers, and increased success in achieving pregnancy where other methods fail. However, disadvantages include high costs, need for specialised professional handling and instrumentation, and barriers related to emotional, religious, and social factors. Moreover, such facilities are available only in limited centres, which makes access difficult for many couples.",

    "correct_answer": "Societal attitudes in India often place the blame for infertility on women, even though the problem may lie with the male partner. This social bias can hinder proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Alternative approaches could include increasing public awareness about the causes of infertility, enhancing the accessibility and affordability of specialised treatment centres, promoting the use of assisted reproductive technologies without societal stigma, and encouraging legal adoption as a viable option for infertile couples. These alternative strategies not only help in relieving societal pressure but also widen the options available for achieving parenthood.",
