    "correct_answer": "Assisted reproductive technologies offer infertile couples a chance to conceive when natural conception is not possible. Advantages include the possibility of addressing underlying infertility issues, technological advances that help bypass certain biological barriers, and increased success in achieving pregnancy where other methods fail. However, disadvantages include high costs, need for specialised professional handling and instrumentation, and barriers related to emotional, religious, and social factors. Moreover, such facilities are available only in limited centres, which makes access difficult for many couples.",

    "correct_answer": "Societal attitudes in India often place the blame for infertility on women, even though the problem may lie with the male partner. This social bias can hinder proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Alternative approaches could include increasing public awareness about the causes of infertility, enhancing the accessibility and affordability of specialised treatment centres, promoting the use of assisted reproductive technologies without societal stigma, and encouraging legal adoption as a viable option for infertile couples. These alternative strategies not only help in relieving societal pressure but also widen the options available for achieving parenthood.",
