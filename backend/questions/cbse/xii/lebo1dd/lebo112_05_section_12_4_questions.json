    "correct_answer": "Energy captured by producers during photosynthesis is transferred to primary consumers (herbivores) when they eat the producers, and then to secondary and tertiary consumers as these organisms feed on each other. The 10% law indicates that only about 10% of the energy at one trophic level is transferred to the next, with the remainder lost as heat. This explains why there is less energy available at higher trophic levels.",

    "correct_answer": "In aquatic ecosystems, the grazing food chain is the main conduit for energy flow, where energy captured by producers like phytoplankton is directly consumed by herbivores and then passed to higher trophic levels. In terrestrial ecosystems, while the grazing food chain is present, a larger fraction of energy flows through the detritus food chain, where dead organic matter is decomposed by bacteria and fungi, releasing nutrients back to the soil. The feeding relationships in the grazing chain are more linear, whereas the detritus chain is often interconnected with other food chains via omnivorous organisms.",

    "correct_answer": "The first law of thermodynamics, which is the conservation of energy principle, indicates that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. In ecosystems, this is observed as energy passing from the sun to producers and then through consumers without being destroyed. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy transfer is not 100% efficient and that energy is lost as heat at each trophic level. This necessitates a continuous input of energy from the sun to maintain the order and functionality of ecosystems.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains how the first law ensures energy is maintained through constant transfers between organisms, while the second law highlights the inefficiencies in these transfers due to energy loss as heat, thereby underlining the need for ongoing solar energy input.",
