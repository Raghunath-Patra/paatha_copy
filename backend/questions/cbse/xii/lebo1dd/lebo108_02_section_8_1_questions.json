    "correct_answer": "The fermentation process for dosa and idli involves bacteria that produce CO2, causing the dough to puff up, whereas bread is fermented using baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In bacterial fermentation, the process is typically faster and results in a slight tangy flavor; in yeast fermentation, the process not only causes the dough to rise due to CO2 production but also imparts a distinct aroma and flavor typical of bread.
