    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A typical biogas plant involves collecting bio-wastes, particularly cattle dung, and mixing it with water in an inlet chamber. This slurry is then fed into a concrete digester where anaerobic bacteria break down the organic matter. As the process continues, biogas, primarily methane and carbon dioxide, is produced and rises, causing a floating cover to move. The gas is then collected in a gas holder and directed through a pipe to be utilized for cooking and lighting. The remaining digested material, called sludge, is removed via an outlet and can be used as fertilizer.",

    "correct_answer": "Methanogens such as Methanobacterium play a critical role in both the cattle rumen and biogas plants by breaking down cellulosic material to produce methane. In the cattle rumen, they help in the breakdown of cellulose, aiding digestion and providing necessary nutrients to the animal. In biogas plants, the same microbes facilitate the anaerobic digestion process, converting organic waste into biogas, a renewable source of energy. This process not only generates clean energy for cooking and lighting but also helps in managing organic waste, thereby reducing environmental pollution and offering an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels.",
