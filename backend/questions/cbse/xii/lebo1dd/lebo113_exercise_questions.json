    "explanation": "The chapter clearly defines biodiversity as having three important components: genetic diversity (variation within a species), species diversity (variety among species), and ecological diversity (variety of ecosystems).",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "By comparing species inventories from well-studied temperate regions with those in tropical areas and extrapolating the ratios, often using statistical methods and models such as species-area relationships.",
    "explanation": "Since species inventories are more complete in temperate regions than in the tropics, ecologists use well-studied groups (like insects) to derive ratios which are then extrapolated to estimate the total number of species on earth. This method takes into account the greater unknown diversity in tropical regions.",

    "question_text": "Give three hypotheses for explaining why tropics show greatest levels of species richness.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "1. Tropics have remained relatively undisturbed over millions of years allowing for extended evolutionary time; 2. Tropical environments are less seasonal and more constant, promoting niche specialization; 3. There is more solar energy in the tropics which increases productivity.",
    "explanation": "The chapter mentions that the tropics benefit from longer periods without disturbance (more time for speciation), constant environmental conditions which favor specialized adaptations, and higher solar energy leading to greater productivity, all of which contribute to higher species richness.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "It indicates how rapidly species richness increases with increasing area. A steeper slope means that species richness is much more sensitive to changes in area.",
    "explanation": "In the species-area relationship expressed as 'log S = log C + Z log A', the slope (Z) shows the rate at which species number increases with area. For larger regions, a steeper slope suggests a greater difference in species count with additional area, implying high sensitivity of biodiversity to habitat area.",

    "correct_answer": "Habitat loss and fragmentation, Over-exploitation, Alien species invasions, and Co-extinctions.",
    "explanation": "The chapter lists these four primary causes (often referred to as the 'Evil Quartet') as the major drivers of species extinction. Each of these factors significantly contributes to the accelerated loss of biodiversity.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Biodiversity is important because it contributes to ecosystem stability, resilience, and productivity. A diverse community can better withstand disturbances and perform various ecological functions that support all life forms.",
    "explanation": "The chapter discusses how higher species diversity leads to more stable ecosystems with less year-to-year variation in biomass, as demonstrated in experiments. Biodiversity ensures that different roles in ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, and pest control, are maintained.",

    "correct_answer": "Sacred groves are ecologically protected areas that are preserved due to religious and cultural traditions. They serve as reservoirs of biodiversity and protect many rare and threatened species.",
    "explanation": "The chapter explains that sacred groves, which exist in several parts of India, have been preserved historically due to cultural reverence for nature. These groves protect unique and threatened species from exploitation and habitat destruction, contributing to in situ biodiversity conservation.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The biotic components, especially vegetation, stabilize soil with their root systems, reduce surface runoff, and absorb excess water, thereby mitigating floods and preventing soil erosion.",
    "explanation": "Plants and trees play a critical role in controlling floods and erosion. Their root systems bind the soil, and their canopies help absorb rainfall, reducing the speed and volume of water runoff. This natural stabilization helps protect against soil loss and flood damage.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Animals, particularly invertebrates like insects, have evolved extensive diversification due to factors such as specialized adaptations, high reproductive rates, ecological versatility, and co-evolution with their environment.",
    "explanation": "The chapter indicates that a large proportion of animal diversity is due to insects, which have a high capacity for speciation and adaptability to various ecological niches. Their evolutionary history has led to significant diversification compared to plants.",

    "correct_answer": "One possible situation is the eradication of an invasive alien species that poses a severe threat to native biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Such measures are justified to protect indigenous species and maintain ecological balance.",
    "explanation": "While deliberately making a species extinct is generally undesirable, in cases where an invasive species causes irreversible harm to native ecosystems, its controlled eradication may be warranted. This approach must be carefully evaluated, weighing the temporary loss against long-term ecosystem benefits.",
