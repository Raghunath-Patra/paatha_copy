The second approach was to sequence the entire genome without prior knowledge of gene location (whole-genome shotgun sequencing) and then annotate different regions. Cloning was used to break the long DNA molecules into smaller fragments, which were then amplified using bacteria and yeast as hosts with BACs and YACs. These cloned fragments were sequenced using automated sequencers based on the Sanger method, and overlapping fragments were aligned using computer programs.",
