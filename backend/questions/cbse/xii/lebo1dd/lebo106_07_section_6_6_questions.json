    "correct_answer": "Mutations are fundamental to evolutionary biology, providing the raw material for variation. Darwin's gradualism emphasizes the role of small, successive changes, while deVries' concept of saltation introduces the idea that significant, sudden changes can also drive evolution. Modern evolutionary biology recognizes that both mechanisms can operate, depending on genetic, environmental, and demographic factors. This integrative view has enriched our understanding of speciation and adaptive evolution, acknowledging that evolution can be both a slow and a rapid process.",
