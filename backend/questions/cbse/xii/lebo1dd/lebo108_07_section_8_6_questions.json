    "correct_answer": "Biofertilisers reduce environmental pollution compared to chemical fertilisers. Bacteria such as Rhizobium fix nitrogen in leguminous plants, while free-living bacteria like Azospirillum and Azotobacter enrich the soil with nitrogen. Fungi, particularly those forming mycorrhiza with roots (e.g., Glomus), enhance phosphorus uptake and protect plants from pathogens. Cyanobacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen in paddy fields and add organic matter to the soil, further increasing fertility. Overall, these processes lead to sustainable agriculture by reducing reliance on chemical inputs and maintaining a healthier ecosystem.",

    "correct_answer": "Mycorrhizal associations significantly improve plant health by enhancing the uptake of phosphorus and other essential nutrients from the soil. This improved nutrient absorption leads to better growth and productivity. Additionally, these associations increase plant resistance to root-borne pathogens and improve tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought and salinity. The exchange of nutrients and defence mechanisms provided by the fungi create a robust support system for the plants, making them more resilient and increasing overall crop yield.",
