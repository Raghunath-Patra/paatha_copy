    "correct_answer": "Recombinant human insulin production begins by separately cloning the DNA sequences corresponding to the A and B chains into plasmids and inserting them into Escherichia coli. The bacteria are cultured to produce large quantities of each chain, which are then isolated and combined under conditions that facilitate the formation of disulphide bonds. This results in the formation of mature, active insulin that mimics naturally produced human insulin.",

    "question_text": "If a tissue culture laboratory produces 3,000 plants in one cycle and each cycle takes 4 weeks, approximately how many plants can be produced in one year (52 weeks) assuming continuous cycles without interruption?",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 39,000 plants",
    "explanation": "One cycle takes 4 weeks, so there are 52/4 = 13 cycles in a year. Therefore, 3,000 plants per cycle multiplied by 13 cycles equals 39,000 plants produced in a year.",
