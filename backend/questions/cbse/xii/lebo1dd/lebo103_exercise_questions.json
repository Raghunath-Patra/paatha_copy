    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Reproductive health is significant because it ensures the overall well-being of individuals by providing essential services such as family planning, maternal and child health care, and the prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections. It also contributes to social and economic stability by reducing maternal and infant mortality and helping manage population growth.",
    "explanation": "The chapter emphasizes the role of reproductive health in building a socially responsible society, controlling the population, and ensuring that couples have access to good health and contraceptive services. These services lead to safer pregnancies, lower mortality rates, and reduced prevalence of sexually transmitted infections.",

    "correct_answer": "Removal of gonads is not considered a contraceptive method because it eliminates the natural production of gametes along with essential hormones, thereby affecting overall health and sexual function, and is not a reversible method of contraception.",
    "explanation": "Contraceptive methods are aimed at preventing the meeting of sperm and ovum while retaining the individual's normal physiological functions. Removing gonads would disrupt the hormonal balance and reproductive function completely, which goes beyond the scope of contraception.",
