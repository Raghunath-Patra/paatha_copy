They proposed that under early Earth’s reducing conditions, simple compounds could undergo chemical reactions to form amino acids, sugars, and other vital organic molecules. Miller’s experiment provided empirical support by demonstrating that an electric discharge in a mixture of gases similar to that of early Earth could produce amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, thereby validating the possibility of chemical evolution leading to life.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The text outlines a sequence beginning with the Big Bang, which marked the origin of the universe approximately 20 billion years ago. As the universe expanded and cooled, hydrogen and helium formed and later condensed under gravitational forces to create galaxies. Within one of these galaxies, the Milky Way, the Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Initially, the Earth had no atmosphere, but volcanic activity released gases like water vapour, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. UV light broke water into hydrogen and oxygen, leading to the formation of the ozone layer. Rainfall subsequently filled depressions to form oceans. Approximately 500 million years after Earth's formation, life began, first as non-cellular self-replicating metabolic capsules and eventually evolving into cellular forms about 2 billion years ago.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The evaluation should consider that spontaneous generation, which posited that life arose from decaying matter, has been disproved by experiments such as those by Louis Pasteur, which demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life. Panspermia suggests that life might have been transferred to Earth from space, a view supported by the presence of organic compounds in meteorites. However, the theory of chemical evolution, supported by experiments like Miller’s, shows that organic molecules can form under early Earth conditions. Based on current evidence, chemical evolution appears more plausible because it provides a stepwise mechanism from inorganic compounds to the simplest self-replicating entities, even though the exact process by which life began remains unknown.",
    "explanation": "The answer should assess the strengths and weaknesses of the various theories, ultimately arguing that chemical evolution is best supported by experimental data, while also acknowledging the intriguing ideas behind panspermia.",
