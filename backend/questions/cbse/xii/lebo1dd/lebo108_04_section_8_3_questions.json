    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The treatment process starts with primary treatment, which involves sequential filtration to remove floating debris and sedimentation to remove grit, resulting in primary sludge and primary effluent. In secondary treatment, the primary effluent is introduced into aeration tanks where it is agitated and oxygen is pumped in. This oxygen supports the growth of aerobic microbes that form flocs and consume organic matter, thereby reducing the BOD. After the biological treatment, the effluent is passed into a settling tank to allow the microbial flocs to settle as activated sludge, a portion of which is recycled back to continue the process.",
