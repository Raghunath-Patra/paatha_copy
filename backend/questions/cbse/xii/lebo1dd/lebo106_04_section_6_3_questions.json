In contrast, analogous structures, like the wings of birds and butterflies or the eyes of octopuses and mammals, evolved independently due to similar environmental pressures. These examples highlight that while homologous structures evolve from a common ancestral structure (divergent evolution), analogous structures arise from convergent evolution where similar environmental challenges lead to similar adaptations in unrelated lineages.",

    "correct_answer": "Human-induced selection has had a profound impact on the evolution of species. Through domestication, humans have created diverse breeds in a short timespan, demonstrating that significant changes can occur within species. Similarly, the use of pesticides and herbicides has led to the rapid evolution of resistant strains in pest populations and weeds, respectively. The industrial pollution example, particularly the shift in moth coloration (from white-winged to melanised moths), underscores how environmental changes driven by human activities can select for traits that increase survival. These examples collectively show that evolution is not only a historical process but continues to occur in response to anthropogenic pressures.",
