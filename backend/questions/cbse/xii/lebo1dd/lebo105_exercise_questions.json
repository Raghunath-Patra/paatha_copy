    "correct_answer": "Nitrogenous bases: Adenine, Thymine, Uracil, Cytosine. Nucleosides: Cytidine and Guanosine.",
    "explanation": "Nitrogenous bases are the core molecules (Adenine, Thymine, Uracil, Cytosine) while nucleosides are formed when a base is linked to a sugar. Here, Cytidine is the nucleoside of Cytosine (with ribose) and Guanosine is the nucleoside of Guanine.",

    "correct_answer": "The complementary base pairing property.",

    "correct_answer": "They used radioactive labeling; bacteriophages were grown in media containing radioactive phosphorus (32P) to label DNA and radioactive sulfur (35S) to label protein, then showed that only 32P entered the bacteria.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) Repetitive DNA refers to any sequences that are repeated throughout the genome, whereas Satellite DNA is a type of repetitive DNA that forms distinct bands during density gradient centrifugation.\n(b) mRNA is the messenger RNA that carries coding information from DNA to the ribosome, while tRNA acts as an adapter that brings the appropriate amino acid during translation.\n(c) The Template strand is the DNA strand used as a template by RNA polymerase during transcription, whereas the Coding strand has the same sequence as the RNA (with thymine in place of uracil) and is not used as the template.",
    "explanation": "Repetitive DNA can be found in various forms across the genome. Satellite DNA is distinguished by its structural behavior during centrifugation. mRNA and tRNA have distinct roles in protein synthesis; one carries genetic information, and the other decodes it. The distinction between the template and coding strand is based on their roles during transcription.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Because lactose is metabolized over time and its level decreases, and also due to regulatory mechanisms including catabolite repression when a preferred carbon source (like glucose) is available, leading to the shutdown of the lac operon.",
    "explanation": "Lactose initially induces the lac operon by inactivating the repressor, but as it is consumed and when glucose becomes available, the system down-regulates the operon through mechanisms like catabolite repression to conserve energy.",
