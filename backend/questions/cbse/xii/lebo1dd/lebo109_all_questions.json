    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Restriction enzymes are used to cut DNA at specific recognition sequences, thus generating fragments that can be isolated and cloned. This is a precise cutting method but does not increase the number of copies of the gene. In contrast, PCR amplifies the target gene exponentially using repeated cycles of denaturation, primer annealing, and extension, creating millions to billions of copies of the gene in vitro. While restriction digestion is crucial for preparing DNA fragments for cloning, PCR is vital for quickly amplifying small amounts of DNA.",
