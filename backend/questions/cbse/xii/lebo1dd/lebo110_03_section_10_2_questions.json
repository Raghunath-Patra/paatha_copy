    "correct_answer": "Recombinant human insulin production begins by separately cloning the DNA sequences corresponding to the A and B chains into plasmids and inserting them into Escherichia coli. The bacteria are cultured to produce large quantities of each chain, which are then isolated and combined under conditions that facilitate the formation of disulphide bonds. This results in the formation of mature, active insulin that mimics naturally produced human insulin.",

The key challenge addressed was assembling the isolated chains into a functionally active insulin molecule, which is successfully managed by controlled chemical formation of disulphide linkages.",

By inserting a functional gene into affected cells, it can potentially offer a long-term cure. However, limitations include the need for repeated treatments if cells are not immortal, immune responses to vectors, and challenges in efficiently delivering the gene to all affected tissues.",
    "explanation": "Gene therapy can correct genetic defects at their source rather than merely managing symptoms. Its success depends on effective gene delivery and stable integration, and while early clinical successes are promising, technical and safety challenges remain.",
