    "correct_answer": "The process begins with the isolation of a gene of interest, such as an antibiotic resistance gene, from a donor DNA. This gene is cut out using restriction enzymes, which act as molecular scissors. The donor gene is then inserted into a plasmid vector, which has been linearized by the same or compatible enzymes. DNA ligase then joins the donor DNA to the vector, forming a circular recombinant DNA molecule. This recombinant DNA is introduced into a host cell, like E. coli, where it replicates, allowing for propagation of the gene.",

    "correct_answer": "Traditional hybridisation methods involve crossing organisms which often results in the inclusion of undesirable genes along with the desired ones. In contrast, recombinant DNA technology specifically isolates and transfers only the gene(s) of interest. This precision minimizes unwanted genetic variations; however, it requires advanced tools and techniques such as restriction enzymes and plasmid vectors.
