    "correct_answer": "Climatic factors such as temperature and soil moisture play a crucial role in the rate of decomposition. Warm and moist conditions enhance the activity of soil microbes, resulting in faster decomposition. Conversely, low temperature and anaerobic conditions slow down microbial activity, leading to a slower breakdown of organic matter and accumulation of detritus. For instance, tropical regions with high temperatures and humidity often experience rapid decomposition, whereas colder or arid regions tend to have a buildup of undecomposed organic materials.",
