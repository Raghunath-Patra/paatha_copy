    "correct_answer": "During copulation, semen containing motile sperms is deposited into the vagina. The sperms then swim through the cervix into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the fallopian tube. Meanwhile, the ovum released from the ovary is transported to the same region. Fertilisation occurs only if both gametes are present simultaneously in the ampullary region.",

    "correct_answer": "After several mitotic divisions, the embryo becomes a morula (a solid ball of 8-16 blastomeres). The morula then transforms into the blastocyst, which is characterized by an outer trophoblast layer and an inner cell mass. The trophoblast attaches to the endometrium, and the uterine cells divide rapidly to enclose the blastocyst, effectively embedding it into the uterine wall, a process called implantation.",

The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein layer that plays a critical role in sperm binding and facilitates the acrosome reaction, which is essential for sperm penetration. The perivitelline space, located between the zona pellucida and the ovum's plasma membrane, is the area where early fusion events occur during fertilisation.",
