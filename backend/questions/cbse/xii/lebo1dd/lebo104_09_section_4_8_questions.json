    "correct_answer": "Pedigree analysis involves tracking the inheritance of traits across generations by using a standardized chart that marks affected and unaffected individuals. This method allows geneticists to determine patterns of inheritance, such as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked traits. For example, diseases like haemophilia and colour blindness, which are X-linked recessive, can be traced through family history to identify carriers and affected individuals. Similarly, autosomal recessive disorders like sickle-cell anaemia and phenylketonuria show specific patterns in pedigrees where the trait may skip generations.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a specific point mutation in the beta globin gene, where glutamic acid is replaced by valine at the sixth position, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that polymerizes under low oxygen conditions. Thalassemia, on the other hand, is due to mutations or deletions that affect the production of one or more globin chains (α or β), leading to reduced synthesis of hemoglobin. Whereas sickle-cell anaemia is a qualitative defect (abnormal structure), thalassemia is a quantitative defect (reduced production).",
