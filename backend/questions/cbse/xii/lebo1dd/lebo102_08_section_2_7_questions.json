    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The neuroendocrine mechanism of parturition involves a complex interplay between the foetus, placenta, and maternal endocrine system. The fully developed foetus and placenta initiate the process by triggering mild uterine contractions known as the fetal ejection reflex. These initial contractions stimulate the maternal pituitary to release oxytocin, which in turn acts on the uterine muscles to produce more forceful contractions. This positive feedback loop intensifies the contractions progressively until the baby is expelled through the birth canal, followed by the expulsion of the placenta.",
    "explanation": "This answer details how the initial fetal and placental signals trigger the fetal ejection reflex, which then leads to a release of oxytocin. The hormone further increases the strength of uterine contractions in a positive feedback loop, culminating in parturition.",

    "correct_answer": "Colostrum is the first form of milk produced at the onset of lactation that is exceptionally rich in antibodies. This early milk provides essential immunological protection to newborns, helping them to resist infections during the initial days of life when their immune system is still developing. In addition to its immunological contents, colostrum also provides nutrients that support the early growth and development of the infant.",
