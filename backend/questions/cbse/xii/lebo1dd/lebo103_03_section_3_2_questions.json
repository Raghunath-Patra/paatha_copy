    ],
    "correct_answer": "By releasing copper ions that suppress sperm motility and increase phagocytosis",
    "explanation": "Copper-releasing IUDs work by releasing copper ions, which create an inflammatory reaction in the uterus. This reaction increases phagocytosis of sperm and suppresses their motility, making the environment unsuitable for fertilization and implantation.",

    "correct_answer": "Natural/traditional methods, such as periodic abstinence, rely on timing intercourse to avoid the fertile window and generally have no side effects but may result in higher failure rates. Barrier methods, like condoms and diaphragms, physically prevent sperm from reaching the ovum, offer additional protection against STIs, and have lower failure rates, though they require correct usage and sometimes may cause minor discomfort or allergic reactions.",
    "explanation": "Natural or traditional methods depend solely on behavioral changes and timing, and while they pose no medicinal side effects, their effectiveness is limited by the predictability of ovulation.
