    "correct_answer": "Meselson and Stahl first grew E. coli in a medium containing 15N, a heavy isotope, so that the DNA became heavy. After transferring the cells into a medium with 14N and sampling the DNA at various time intervals, they used CsCl density gradient centrifugation to separate the DNA molecules. After one generation, all DNA showed an intermediate (hybrid) density, indicating that each DNA molecule consisted of one heavy and one light strand. In subsequent generations, a mix of hybrid and light DNA molecules was observed, confirming that each new molecule resulted from one old (template) strand and one newly synthesized strand, which supports the semiconservative model.",

    "correct_answer": "Replicating long DNA molecules poses challenges such as the impracticality of separating the entire double helix at once due to high energy requirements. Cells overcome this by creating a replication fork, a small open region where the strands are unwound and only a portion of the molecule is replicated at any one time. Additionally, the antiparallel nature of the DNA necessitates that one strand (the lagging strand) be synthesized discontinuously in short fragments, which are later joined by DNA ligase. A coordinated assembly of multiple enzymes, including DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and ligases, ensures both speed and high accuracy in replication.",
