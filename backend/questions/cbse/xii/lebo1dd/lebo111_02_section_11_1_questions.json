    "correct_answer": "The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) quantifies the potential growth of a population under ideal conditions by combining per capita birth and death rates.

    "correct_answer": "Exponential growth assumes unlimited resources and leads to a J-shaped curve, where the population increases rapidly without any environmental limits. Logistic growth, on the other hand, incorporates the concept of carrying capacity (K), reflecting resource limitations, and results in a sigmoid (S-shaped) curve where growth decelerates as the population nears its environmental maximum. The exponential model is useful for understanding potential growth, while the logistic model provides a more realistic scenario where factors such as competition and predation eventually stabilize the population.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Interspecific interactions include predation (e.g., tigers preying on deer; responsible for energy transfer and controlling prey populations), competition (e.g., barnacles competing for space; can lead to the exclusion of one species under limited resources), parasitism (e.g., liver fluke affecting its host; often results in reduced fitness of the host), commensalism (e.g., barnacles on whales; one benefits while the other is unaffected), amensalism (one species is harmed while the other remains unaffected), and mutualism (e.g., lichens formed by fungi and algae; both partners benefit).
