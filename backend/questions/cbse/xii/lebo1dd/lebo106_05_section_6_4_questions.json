    "correct_answer": "Adaptive radiation in both Darwin's finches and Australian marsupials involves the diversification of species from a common ancestor to adapt to different ecological niches. In Darwin's finches, variations in beak shape evolved to exploit different food sources on the Galapagos Islands, while in Australian marsupials, different species adapted to a variety of ecological roles within the Australian continent. Although both show diversification as a response to environmental challenges, the finches illustrate microevolutionary changes in a relatively contained area, whereas marsupials reflect broader morphological and ecological adaptations within a larger geographic region.",

For example, the diagrams show that both placental mammals and Australian marsupials have evolved analogous characteristics, such as similar body shapes and functional adaptations, despite having different ancestral lineages. This parallel adaptation indicates that natural selection independently favored traits that best suited similar ecological roles, providing robust evidence for its role in shaping biodiversity.",
