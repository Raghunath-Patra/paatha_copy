Disadvantages may include potential environmental risks, ethical concerns, gene flow to non-target species, and issues related to patents and monopolies.",
    "explanation": "Genetically modified crops offer significant benefits such as higher yields and improved nutritional profiles which help meet the growing food demands.

    "correct_answer": "Cry proteins are insecticidal proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Man has exploited these proteins by isolating the corresponding genes (such as cryIAc) and incorporating them into crop plants, thereby creating insect-resistant varieties like Bt cotton and Bt corn.",
    "explanation": "Cry proteins are an effective natural pest control method. By genetic engineering, these proteins are expressed in transgenic crops, reducing dependency on chemical pesticides and thereby offering an environmentally friendly approach to pest management.",

    "correct_answer": "Gene therapy is the introduction of a functional gene into a person's cells to compensate for a defective gene. In the case of ADA deficiency, a functional ADA gene is introduced into the patient’s lymphocytes using a retroviral vector, which are then reintroduced into the patient to restore the enzyme activity.",
    "explanation": "The example of ADA deficiency illustrates how gene therapy can be used to correct metabolic disorders by replacing a missing or non-functional gene. Although initial treatments require repeated infusions, early intervention at the embryonic stage could potentially offer a permanent cure.",

    "explanation": "The process involves standard recombinant DNA techniques where the gene is first isolated and inserted into a plasmid vector. Subsequent transformation and expression in E. coli make it possible to produce large quantities of the protein. A diagram would show each step sequentially.",
