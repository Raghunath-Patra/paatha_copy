    "correct_answer": "The immune system identifies and eliminates foreign tissues through its ability to discriminate between 'self' and 'non-self.' In organ transplantation, if the donor tissue does not match the recipient's tissue (in terms of blood group and tissue markers), T-lymphocytes and other immune components recognize the donor cells as foreign and initiate an immune response leading to graft rejection. This is why tissue matching and immunosuppressants are necessary.",

Examples include rheumatoid arthritis. These conditions can significantly impair normal bodily functions and quality of life, and managing them typically requires lifelong medical intervention and immunosuppressive therapies.",
