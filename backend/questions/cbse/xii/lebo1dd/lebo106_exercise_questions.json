    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Antibiotic resistance arises when random genetic variations in bacteria allow some individuals to survive in the presence of antibiotics. These survivors reproduce and pass on the resistant traits, leading to a population dominated by resistant bacteria.",
    "explanation": "Under Darwinian selection, environmental pressures such as antibiotic use favor bacteria with mutations that confer resistance. As these resistant bacteria multiply, the overall population becomes less susceptible to the antibiotic, demonstrating natural selection in action.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Tracing human evolution involves noting progressive increases in brain size and changes in brain function, modifications in skeletal structure such as the development of bipedalism and changes in the skull, as well as dietary shifts from primarily fruit and vegetable consumption to include meat and cooked food. Key stages include early hominids like Australopithecines, followed by Homo habilis, Homo erectus, and eventually Homo sapiens.",
    "explanation": "The answer should outline the multiple aspects of human evolution, such as morphological changes and dietary adaptations over millions of years, supported by fossil evidence and evolutionary biology principles. It should detail how these components contributed to the development of modern humans.",

    "correct_answer": "Research shows that several animal species, including dolphins, elephants, certain primates, and some bird species, display signs of self-awareness, for example, through mirror self-recognition tests. However, the degree and nature of self-consciousness may differ from that seen in humans.",
    "explanation": "This question requires gathering research findings from reputable sources to address the existence and degree of self-consciousness in animals. The answer should summarize experimental evidence and observations that indicate self-awareness beyond humans.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Human evolution is not typically classified as adaptive radiation because it involves a more linear progression with gradual changes rather than rapid diversification into multiple species from a single ancestor in a confined geographical area.",
    "explanation": "Adaptive radiation usually refers to a single ancestral species rapidly diversifying into several different forms to occupy different niches. In contrast, human evolution is characterized by a relatively continuous sequence of adaptations leading from early hominids to modern Homo sapiens, with limited parallel diversification.",
