    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 0.231 per year",
    "explanation": "For exponential growth, doubling time (T) and the intrinsic rate of increase (r) are related by the equation r = ln(2)/T. With T = 3 years, r = ln(2)/3, which is approximately 0.231.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Commensalism: An interaction where one species benefits and the other is unaffected (e.g., cattle egret feeding near grazing cattle). Parasitism: An interaction where one species benefits at the expense of the host (e.g., ticks on a dog). Camouflage: An adaptation that allows an organism to blend with its background to avoid detection (e.g., stick insect mimicking a twig). Mutualism: An interaction providing benefits to both species (e.g., bee pollinating a flower while receiving nectar). Interspecific competition: Competition between different species for limited resources (e.g., flamingos and small fish competing for zooplankton).",
    "explanation": "Each term describes a type of interaction or adaptation. Commensalism benefits one species without affecting the other, parasitism benefits one at the expense of the other, camouflage is a survival adaptation, mutualism benefits both, and interspecific competition involves different species competing for the same limited resource.",

    "explanation": "The logistic growth model accounts for limited resources. Initially, growth is slow (lag phase), then increases rapidly, and finally slows as the population nears the maximum supportable size (K). The differential equation dN/dt = rN((K - N)/K) describes this pattern.",
