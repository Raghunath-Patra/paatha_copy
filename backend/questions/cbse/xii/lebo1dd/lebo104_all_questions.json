    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Pea plants are advantageous because they have easily observable contrasting traits, are true-breeding, have a short generation time, are easy to self- and cross-pollinate, and provide large sample sizes for statistical accuracy.",
    "explanation": "Pea plants have many contrasting characters (such as tall/dwarf, yellow/green seeds), they are true breeding meaning their traits remain stable, and they are manageable in a lab setting with rapid generation cycles.

    "correct_answer": "Dominance refers to the phenomenon where one allele masks the expression of another in a heterozygous condition, while recessive alleles are masked in such pairings. Homozygous means having identical alleles for a trait, whereas heterozygous means possessing two different alleles. A monohybrid cross involves one pair of contrasting traits, while a dihybrid cross involves two pairs of traits.",

Incomplete dominance is when the heterozygous phenotype is an intermediate blend of the two homozygous phenotypes; for example, crossing red-flowered snapdragons (RR) with white-flowered ones (rr) produces pink-flowered offspring (Rr).",

    "correct_answer": "Different types of mutations, including point mutations and frame-shift mutations, can have varied impacts on gene function. For example, point mutations, which involve a single base pair change, can lead to diseases such as sickle cell anemia, while frame-shift mutations often result in more severe protein malfunctions. Furthermore, chromosomal aberrations caused by deletions or insertions can lead to significant genetic abnormalities and are commonly observed in cancer cells. Evaluating these mutation types provides insights into how seemingly small changes at the molecular level can drive disease pathology and cancer progression.",
    "explanation": "The answer discusses the severity of different mutation types and their direct link to genetic disorders and cancer, emphasizing that changes in the genome can have widespread effects on cellular function and health.",
