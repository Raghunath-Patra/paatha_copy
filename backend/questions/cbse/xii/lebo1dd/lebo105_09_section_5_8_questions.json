    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the absence of an inducer, the repressor protein, which is continuously produced, binds to the operator region of the lac operon. This binding prevents RNA polymerase from accessing the promoter and transcribing the operon genes. Once an inducer, such as lactose or its isomer allolactose, is present, it binds to the repressor. This binding causes a conformational change in the repressor, making it unable to bind to the operator. Consequently, RNA polymerase is free to bind to the promoter and transcribe the genes, leading to the production of enzymes required for lactose metabolism.",
    "explanation": "This mechanism highlights a fundamental control process in gene regulation, where the default state is repression. The presence of an inducer alleviates this repression, enabling gene expression.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The presence of lactose leads to the formation of an inducer (allolactose) that binds to the lac repressor, thereby inactivating it. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and transcribe the lac operon, which is crucial for lactose metabolism. Conversely, the absence of glucose removes the repression that would typically be exerted by glucose-mediated regulatory pathways (such as catabolite repression), facilitating a higher level of lac operon transcription. Thus, when lactose is present and glucose is absent, E. coli efficiently expresses enzymes needed for lactose utilization.",
    "explanation": "This regulation ensures that the bacteria optimally utilize available energy sources. It prevents unnecessary production of enzymes when a preferred carbon source like glucose is available, and promotes expression when lactose is the main carbon source.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experimental approach could involve constructing E. coli strains with reporter genes fused to the lac operon promoter. By growing these bacteria in media with varying concentrations of lactose and glucose, one can monitor the reporter gene expression using techniques like fluorescence or colorimetric assays. Additionally, mutational analysis can be conducted where the repressor binding site (operator) or the repressor gene itself is altered, to study the effects on gene expression. The role of inducers can be examined by adding lactose or allolactose analogs and observing changes in reporter activity, while using repressor mutants will diminish the regulation allowing insights into negative regulation mechanisms.",
