    "correct_answer": "The hormonal interplay involves a coordinated fluctuation of pituitary hormones FSH and LH along with ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone. FSH and LH stimulate follicular development and estrogen secretion during the follicular phase, while the mid-cycle LH surge triggers ovulation. After ovulation, the corpus luteum forms during the luteal phase and secretes progesterone, which maintains the endometrium.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The menstrual cycle begins with the menstrual phase, during which the endometrial lining is shed over 3-5 days. This is followed by the follicular phase, where ovarian follicles develop and the endometrium regenerates. Around the midpoint of the cycle, the LH surge triggers ovulation, releasing an ovum. The cycle then enters the luteal phase, where the remnant of the follicle forms the corpus luteum, secreting progesterone to maintain the endometrium. In the absence of fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a drop in progesterone and the disintegration of the endometrium, marking the start of a new menstrual cycle.",

    "correct_answer": "Alterations in the secretion of FSH and LH can disrupt the delicate balance required for follicular development and ovulation. Low levels of these hormones may lead to insufficient follicle maturation, reduced estrogen production, and failure to trigger the LH surge, which can prevent ovulation. Conversely, an early or excessive surge may result in premature ovulation, disrupting the synchronization between follicular development and endometrial preparation, potentially leading to fertility issues.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A possible hypothesis is that stress increases cortisol levels, which in turn interferes with the release of gonadotropins (FSH and LH), leading to irregularities in follicular development and ovulation. An experimental design could involve monitoring a group of women under normal conditions and a group experiencing chronic stress. Hormonal levels (cortisol, FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone) would be measured periodically over several menstrual cycles, along with recording cycle lengths and characteristics. Statistical analysis would be used to determine if elevated cortisol correlates with menstrual irregularities.",
