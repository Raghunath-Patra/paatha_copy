    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Pea plants are advantageous because they have easily observable contrasting traits, are true-breeding, have a short generation time, are easy to self- and cross-pollinate, and provide large sample sizes for statistical accuracy.",
    "explanation": "Pea plants have many contrasting characters (such as tall/dwarf, yellow/green seeds), they are true breeding meaning their traits remain stable, and they are manageable in a lab setting with rapid generation cycles. This made it easier for Mendel to deduce patterns in inheritance.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Dominance refers to the phenomenon where one allele masks the expression of another in a heterozygous condition, while recessive alleles are masked in such pairings. Homozygous means having identical alleles for a trait, whereas heterozygous means possessing two different alleles. A monohybrid cross involves one pair of contrasting traits, while a dihybrid cross involves two pairs of traits.",
    "explanation": "The answer highlights the essential distinctions: dominance vs recessiveness in allele expression, homozygous vs heterozygous genetic makeup, and that monohybrid crosses study a single trait while dihybrid crosses observe two traits concurrently.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Law of Dominance states that in a heterozygote, one allele (the dominant) masks the effect of the other allele (the recessive). In a monohybrid cross, for example, if a true-breeding tall plant (TT) is crossed with a dwarf plant (tt), the F1 progeny (Tt) will all display the tall phenotype because the tall allele is dominant over the dwarf allele.",
    "explanation": "By crossing true-breeding plants with contrasting traits, Mendel observed that the F1 generation uniformly exhibited the dominant trait. This observation led to the formulation of the Law of Dominance, a fundamental concept in Mendelian genetics.",

    "correct_answer": "If we assume the trait is governed by a dominant allele, crossing a homozygous dominant female (TT) with a heterozygous male (Tt) would produce offspring that are 50% homozygous dominant (TT) and 50% heterozygous (Tt), resulting in 100% displaying the dominant phenotype.",

    "correct_answer": "When the genes are linked, the parental phenotypes will appear in higher proportions than the recombinant phenotypes. In the extreme case of complete linkage (no crossing over), only the two parental phenotypes would appear in the F2 generation, typically in a 1:1 ratio. With partial linkage, recombinant phenotypes would appear at a lower frequency than expected under independent assortment.",
    "explanation": "Linkage means that the genes are located close together on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together. This disrupts the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio seen when genes assort independently, resulting in a skewed distribution emphasizing parental gene combinations.",

For the child to have genotype ii, the father (with blood group A) must be heterozygous (IAi) and the mother (with blood group B) must also be heterozygous (IBi). The possible offspring genotypes from this cross are: IAIB (AB blood group), IAi (blood group A), IBi (blood group B), and ii (blood group O), each occurring with approximately equal probability.",
    "explanation": "Since the O blood type is recessive (ii), both parents must carry the recessive allele. Their heterozygous condition allows for a chance that an offspring inherits the recessive allele from both parents, leading to blood group O.

    "correct_answer": "Co-dominance is a form of inheritance in which both alleles in a heterozygote are fully expressed, as seen in the human ABO blood group system where alleles IA and IB express together to form type AB blood. Incomplete dominance is when the heterozygous phenotype is an intermediate blend of the two homozygous phenotypes; for example, crossing red-flowered snapdragons (RR) with white-flowered ones (rr) produces pink-flowered offspring (Rr).",
