    "correct_answer": "The ethical argument for biodiversity conservation stresses our moral duty to care for other species, recognizing each species' intrinsic value regardless of its economic utility. In contrast, the utilitarian arguments—both narrowly and broadly utilitarian—emphasize the direct benefits to humans, such as economic gains from medicinal plants and ecosystem services like pollination and oxygen production. Together, these arguments underline that conserving biodiversity is essential not only for maintaining ecological balance and human health, but also as a matter of ethical responsibility to future generations.",

    "correct_answer": "The challenges in biodiversity conservation arise from the conflict between development and ecological protection. With limited conservation resources and an overwhelming number of species at risk, nations must decide which areas to prioritize. This has led to the identification of biodiversity hotspots as regions requiring urgent protection. However, even with these targeted efforts, accelerated habitat loss and competing economic interests make it difficult to protect all species, showcasing the need for strategic and sometimes contentious conservation planning.",

    "correct_answer": "In situ conservation involves protecting species within their natural habitats, thereby preserving the entire ecosystem and its complex interactions, as exemplified by the protection of forests to save tigers. Ex situ conservation, on the other hand, involves removing species from their natural habitats and safeguarding them in controlled environments such as zoological parks and botanical gardens. This method is particularly used for endangered species where urgent measures are needed to prevent extinction. Additionally, ex situ techniques have advanced to include modern biotechnological methods like cryopreservation and tissue culture, highlighting the adaptability and focused intervention required for species at high risk.",
    "explanation": "The answer clearly differentiates the two strategies, emphasizing that in situ conservation aims at ecosystem-level protection while ex situ involves specialized care in artificial conditions, and also notes the technological advancements used in the latter.",
