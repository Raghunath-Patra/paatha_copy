    "correct_answer": "A complete answer should explain that: (a) Grazing food chain involves the direct consumption of live producers by herbivores leading to consumers, whereas the detritus food chain begins with dead organic matter decomposed by saprotrophs; (b) Production is the synthesis of organic substances by autotrophs (primary production), while decomposition is the breakdown of dead organic matter into simpler inorganic substances; (c) An upright pyramid indicates a decrease in number, biomass, or energy from the base to the apex, while an inverted pyramid shows a reversal of this pattern; (d) A food chain is a single linear pathway of energy flow, while a food web is a complex network of interconnected food chains; (e) Litter refers to fallen plant material on the ground, whereas detritus encompasses all dead organic matter, including waste; (f) Primary productivity is the rate at which producers create organic matter, and secondary productivity is the rate at which consumers (heterotrophs) produce biomass.",

    "correct_answer": "Ecological pyramids are graphical representations that show the distribution of organisms, biomass, or energy among different trophic levels. A pyramid of numbers represents the count of individual organisms at each level, while a pyramid of biomass shows the total mass of living material at each trophic level. For example, in a grassland ecosystem, the number of producers might be fewer than the number of herbivores, resulting in an inverted pyramid of numbers, and in many terrestrial ecosystems, biomass decreases from producers to tertiary consumers.",

    "correct_answer": "Decomposition is the process by which complex organic matter is broken down into simpler inorganic compounds. The process includes several steps: fragmentation (physical breakdown by detritivores like earthworms), leaching (loss of water-soluble substances), catabolism (enzymatic degradation by bacteria and fungi), humification (formation of humus), and mineralisation (conversion of humus into mineral nutrients such as carbon dioxide, water, and other nutrients).",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Energy flow in an ecosystem begins with the capture of solar energy by producers through photosynthesis. This energy is then transferred to primary consumers when they feed on producers, and further to secondary and tertiary consumers as one organism eats another. At each trophic level, only about 10% of the energy is transferred to the next level, with the remainder lost as heat. Additionally, energy is dissipated when organisms die and become detritus, which supports decomposers that return nutrients to the system.",
    "explanation": "The explanation outlines the unidirectional movement of energy, the inefficient transfer of energy between trophic levels (10% law), and underscores the inevitable energy loss as heat, highlighting fundamental ecological principles.",
