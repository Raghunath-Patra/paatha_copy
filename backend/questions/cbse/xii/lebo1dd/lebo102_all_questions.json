    "correct_answer": "During the first trimester, the inner cell mass differentiates into three primary germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The ectoderm gives rise to structures such as the nervous system and skin, the mesoderm forms muscles, bones, and the circulatory system, and the endoderm develops into internal organs like the liver and lungs. This process of differentiation is vital because it lays the foundation for all the tissues and organs in a fully developed fetus.",
    "explanation": "This answer should describe the sequence of events in embryonic development and highlight the critical roles of each germ layer in forming specific systems within the body.",
