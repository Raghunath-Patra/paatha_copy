    "correct_answer": "The process starts with isolating the DNA from the target source and the vector DNA. Both DNA molecules are then cut with the same restriction enzyme to produce compatible sticky ends. These sticky ends facilitate the annealing of the foreign DNA with the vector DNA. Finally, DNA ligase is used to seal the nicks, resulting in a stable recombinant DNA molecule that can be introduced into a host organism for replication.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The selection process involves using a cloning vector that carries two antibiotic resistance genes. When foreign DNA is inserted into one of these genes (e.g., tetR), that gene becomes inactivated, while the other remains functional. Bacterial colonies are plated on medium containing one antibiotic to select for transformants, and then replica plated on medium containing the second antibiotic. Recombinant colonies, which have lost one resistance due to insertional inactivation, will not grow on the second antibiotic medium. This strategy enables the identification and isolation of recombinant colonies.",
