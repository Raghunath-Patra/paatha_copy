    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Possible answers include: human insulin (for diabetes), human growth hormone (for growth deficiencies), erythropoietin (for anemia), interferons (for viral infections), tissue plasminogen activator (for clot dissolution), factor VIII (for hemophilia), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (for neutropenia), monoclonal antibodies (for cancer and autoimmune disorders), etanercept (for rheumatoid arthritis), and others as discovered by research.",

    "correct_answer": "A diagram could show, for example, EcoRI acting on its substrate with the recognition sequence GAATTC by cutting between the G and A nucleotides to produce DNA fragments with sticky ends.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "DNA is generally larger in molecular size than enzymes.",
    "explanation": "Although enzymes are complex proteins, DNA molecules are long polymers composed of thousands to billions of nucleotides. This high molecular weight and length make DNA, in most cases, larger than individual enzyme molecules. This conclusion can be reached by comparing typical molecular weights and the nature of polymers versus proteins.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 10 mM (0.01 M) is a rough estimate, though the exact value should be determined with a proper calculation based on genome size and nuclear volume.",
    "explanation": "The molar concentration can be approximated by using the total number of nucleotides in the genome and the volume of the nucleus. Since the human genome has billions of base pairs and the nucleus occupies a very small volume, the concentration is relatively high. However, precise calculation requires detailed data and consultation.",

    "explanation": "Restriction endonucleases are primarily found in prokaryotes where they serve as a defense mechanism against invading viral DNA. Eukaryotic cells lack these enzymes because their mechanisms for regulating and protecting their genomic DNA are different.",

    "correct_answer": "During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo crossing over, which is the natural process of recombination.",
    "explanation": "In biological systems, genetic recombination occurs during prophase I of meiosis through crossing over between homologous chromosomes. It is important to note that while this natural process creates recombinant chromosomes, recombinant DNA technology is an in vitro technique that mimics the concept of recombination.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A reporter enzyme such as Î²-galactosidase can be fused to a gene of interest so that its expression produces a detectable color change (for example, blue/white screening) in the presence of a chromogenic substrate, thereby indicating successful transformation.",
    "explanation": "Reporter enzymes serve as visual indicators of gene expression. When fused to a gene inserted in the host, they provide a means to quickly assess transformation efficiency and distinguish between recombinant and non-recombinant cells.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Plasmid DNA is typically circular, smaller, and replicates independently from chromosomal DNA, which is linear (in eukaryotes) and contains the majority of genetic information. (b) RNA differs from DNA in that RNA contains ribose sugar, uses uracil in place of thymine, and is usually single-stranded compared to the double-stranded nature of DNA. (c) Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands, while endonucleases cleave at specific positions within the DNA molecule.",
