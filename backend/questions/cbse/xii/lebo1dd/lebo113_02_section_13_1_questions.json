    "correct_answer": "The rivet popper hypothesis compares species in an ecosystem to rivets in an airplane. While the loss of a few rivets may not immediately impair the function of the airplane, the removal of too many can jeopardize its structural integrity. Similarly, while the loss of a few species might not initially affect ecosystem functioning, continued species loss can eventually lead to a collapse in ecosystem stability.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Species diversity is crucial for ecosystem stability and productivity. David Tilmanâ€™s experiments demonstrated that plots with a greater number of species showed less year-to-year variation in biomass production and higher overall productivity. This suggests that diverse ecosystems are more resistant and resilient to disturbances. The rivet popper hypothesis further illustrates that each species plays a significant role in the ecosystem, much like each rivet is essential in maintaining the structural integrity of an airplane. The loss of multiple species may eventually lead to a breakdown in ecosystem functions similar to an airplane losing too many rivets. Together, these findings underscore the critical value of maintaining high species diversity for ecosystem health.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The text identifies four major causes of biodiversity loss: habitat loss and fragmentation, overexploitation, alien species invasions, and co-extinctions. Habitat loss, notably in tropical rainforests, disrupts and diminishes the living space of countless species. Overexploitation depletes natural resources and can drive species to extinction. Alien species invasions introduce competitors, predators, or diseases that native species cannot withstand, while co-extinctions occur when the loss of one species leads to the loss of others that depend on it. Conservation strategies could include the establishment and effective management of protected areas, sustainable resource harvesting practices, strict controls on the introduction of non-native species, and the development of restoration programs to reconnect fragmented habitats. These strategies aim to preserve ecosystem integrity and ensure the survival of species, thereby maintaining overall biodiversity.",
