    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In bacteria, transcription involves three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. During initiation, the sigma factor associates with RNA polymerase to help recognize and bind to the promoter region. In elongation, RNA polymerase synthesizes the RNA in the 5' to 3' direction, moving along the DNA template. During termination, the rho factor (if involved) aids in dislodging the RNA polymerase from the DNA at a terminator sequence, releasing the newly synthesized RNA. This coordinated interplay ensures accurate and efficient transcription.",

    "correct_answer": "In eukaryotic genes, the presence of introns (non-coding sequences) and exons (coding sequences) allows for a split-gene arrangement. This organization provides opportunities for alternative splicing, where different combinations of exons can be joined together to produce multiple mRNA variants from a single gene. Splicing not only removes non-functional introns but also plays a key role in regulating gene expression by generating protein diversity and allowing temporal or tissue-specific expression of proteins.",
    "explanation": "The split-gene structure increases the complexity of gene regulation and protein diversity in eukaryotes. The splicing process is central to converting the primary transcript into a functional mRNA capable of guiding protein synthesis.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA in the 5'-3' direction, meaning that it adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing RNA chain. The DNA template strand is read in the 3'-5' direction, ensuring that the RNA sequence is complementary to the DNA template. This inherent directionality maintains the correct orientation and sequence integrity of the RNA transcript, as the coding strand of the DNA effectively matches the RNA sequence (with the substitution of uracil for thymine). Any disruption in this polarity could result in an incorrect RNA transcript, affecting protein synthesis.",
