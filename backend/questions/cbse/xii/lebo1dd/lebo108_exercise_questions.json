If you have to carry a sample from your home to your biology laboratory to demonstrate the presence of microbes with the help of a microscope, which sample would you carry and why?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A sample of curd.",
    "explanation": "Curd is produced by the fermentation of milk using lactic acid bacteria (LAB). These bacteria are present in high numbers in curd, making it an ideal sample to demonstrate microbial presence under a microscope. It is easily available at home and illustrates the role of microbes in everyday food processing.",

    "correct_answer": "Examples include the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the fermentation of dough for dosa, idli and bread, and the production of methane in biogas plants.",
    "explanation": "In dough fermentation, yeast and bacteria convert sugars into CO2, which makes the dough rise (as seen in bread and dosa/idli preparations). In biogas production, anaerobic bacteria (methanogens) break down organic matter producing methane and other gases. These processes clearly show gas release as a by-product of microbial metabolism.",

Biocontrol agents such as Bacillus thuringiensis and Trichoderma species suppress pest populations and control plant diseases.",
    "explanation": "Using biofertilisers improves soil nutrient content naturally, reducing the need for synthetic fertilisers. Similarly, biocontrol agents target specific pests or pathogens without harming beneficial organisms, thereby reducing the widespread use of chemical pesticides which can have detrimental effects on the environment and non-target species.",

    "correct_answer": "The sample with 400 mg/L BOD is the untreated sewage water (most polluted), the sample with 20 mg/L is the secondary effluent, and the sample with 8 mg/L is the river water.",
    "explanation": "BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) is a measure of organic pollution; a higher value indicates more organic matter and higher pollution.
