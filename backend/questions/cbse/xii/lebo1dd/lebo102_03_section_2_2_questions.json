It is then guided through the ampulla, where fertilization typically occurs, and finally passes through the isthmus before entering the uterus. Each segment plays a specific role: the infundibulum collects the ovum, the ampulla provides a site for fertilization, and the isthmus assists in the regulated movement of the fertilized egg towards the uterus.",
