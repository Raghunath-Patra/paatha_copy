    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism begins with the protonation of the ether oxygen in methoxybenzene by HI, generating an oxonium ion. This increases the electrophilicity of the adjacent carbon, leading iodide ion to attack the methyl group in an SN2 mechanism, cleaving the C–O bond. The cleavage results in the formation of methyl iodide and phenol.",
    "explanation": "Initially, the lone pair electrons on the oxygen atom of methoxybenzene are protonated by HI, forming an oxonium ion. This step enhances the leaving ability of the methoxy group. The iodide ion then attacks the less hindered methyl carbon (via backside attack in an SN2 mechanism), leading to the cleavage of the C–O bond. The products formed are methyl iodide (CH3I) and phenol (C6H5OH). This mechanism illustrates how protonation facilitates nucleophilic substitution in ether cleavage reactions.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "1-Propoxypropane, being a symmetrical ether, reacts via a straightforward SN2 mechanism to form 1-iodopropane and 1-propanol. Methoxybenzene (anisole) undergoes protonation at the oxygen and then an SN2 attack at the methyl group, yielding phenol and methyl iodide. Benzyl ethyl ether’s benzyl group can stabilize a carbocation intermediate through resonance, favoring cleavage at that position to form benzyl iodide and ethanol.",
    "explanation": "The reactivity differences arise from the structure of the ethers. 1-Propoxypropane, with no special stabilizing groups and low steric hindrance, reacts through a simple SN2 mechanism. Methoxybenzene's aromatic ring decreases the reactivity of the oxygen but still allows methyl substitution due to the small size of the methyl group. Benzyl ethyl ether features a benzyl group that can stabilize a positive charge due to resonance, making the benzyl side more reactive toward nucleophilic attack by iodide, hence leading to cleavage that specifically yields benzyl iodide. Steric factors and electronic effects such as resonance stabilization influence the pathway and product distribution in each case.",
