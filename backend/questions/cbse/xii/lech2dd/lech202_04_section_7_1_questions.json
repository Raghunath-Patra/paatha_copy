Increased steric hindrance in (vi) can slow down certain reactions such as nucleophilic substitution, making tertiary alcohols generally less reactive in such mechanisms.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Primary alcohols, such as compounds (i), (ii), and (iii), tend to be less sterically hindered and usually react via SN2 mechanisms, where the nucleophile attacks directly. In contrast, tertiary alcohols like compound (vi) are more hindered and favor SN1 mechanisms, where the formation of a carbocation intermediate occurs. The number of alkyl substituents not only affects steric hindrance but also the stability of potential carbocations. Tertiary carbocations are more stable than primary ones, thus facilitating reactions that proceed through the SN1 pathway despite the increased steric hindrance.",
    "explanation": "This answer discusses how primary alcohols allow for backside attack typical of SN2 reactions due to minimal steric hindrance, whereas tertiary alcohols, with more alkyl groups, form more stable carbocations but are less accessible to nucleophilic attack.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Neighboring groups can have a significant impact on the electronic and steric environment of the hydroxyl-bearing carbon. For example, the double bond in compound (ii) introduces conjugative effects that can delocalize charge during reaction intermediates, thereby increasing the reactivity despite the compound being primary. Similarly, the benzene ring in compound (iv) not only influences electron distribution through resonance but also adds a level of steric hindrance that can modify the reaction pathway. These influences require a careful analysis when predicting reaction mechanisms and rates, as electronic stabilization may favor certain mechanisms (such as SN1) while steric congestion might inhibit others (such as SN2).",
    "explanation": "The answer must integrate principles such as resonance stabilization and steric hindrance. Electronic effects provided by double bonds or aromatic rings can stabilize intermediates or transition states, while steric effects may impede the approach of reagents.
