    "correct_answer": "The ethanol fermentation process begins with invertase hydrolysing sucrose into glucose and fructose. These monosaccharides are then fermented by the enzyme zymase to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide under anaerobic conditions. The process is sensitive to oxygen, which, if introduced, can oxidize ethanol to ethanoic acid, thereby spoiling the product. Environmental conditions like temperature, substrate concentration, and pH play critical roles in ensuring efficient fermentation.",
