    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The high regioselectivity is due to the strong activating effect of the hydroxyl group in phenol, which increases electron density at the ortho and para positions. In CS₂, an inert solvent that does not engage in hydrogen bonding, the bromine electrophile is directed specifically to the sterically and electronically favored positions (2, 4, and 6), leading to full substitution. Additionally, the reaction conditions favor complete bromination over partial substitution.",
    "explanation": "Phenol's –OH group directs electrophilic attack to the ortho and para positions. The use of CS₂ as a solvent avoids competing solvent effects which might otherwise slow the reaction.

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the oxidation of a primary alcohol like propan-1-ol, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is initially in a lower oxidation state. During oxidation with alkaline KMnO₄, this carbon loses hydrogen atoms and forms a carboxylate group, which corresponds to an increase in its oxidation state. The KMnO₄ acts as a strong oxidizing agent, being reduced to MnO₂ in the process. The conversion is typically complete, transforming the alcohol into propanoic acid (or its sodium salt in the basic medium).",
    "explanation": "Primary alcohols are oxidized in a stepwise manner, often proceeding through an aldehyde intermediate, but under strong oxidative conditions (as with KMnO₄ in base) the reaction goes directly to the carboxylate stage. The increase in oxidation state corresponds to the removal of electrons from the carbon atom in the –CH₂OH group.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Reimer-Tiemann reaction offers the advantage of directly converting readily available phenol into salicylaldehyde under relatively mild conditions. Its regioselectivity for ortho-formylation makes it a valuable synthetic tool. However, the reaction also has drawbacks, including moderate yields, the generation of corrosive by-products (such as NaCl and side products from multiple reaction pathways), and the requirement for stringent control of reaction conditions. Furthermore, the mechanism involves reactive intermediate species, which can lead to unwanted side reactions if not properly managed.",
    "explanation": "While the reaction is useful due to its specificity and direct conversion of phenol to a synthetically important compound, the sensitivity of the intermediates, lower yields, and potential safety hazards associated with handling CHCl₃ and NaOH are significant limitations.
