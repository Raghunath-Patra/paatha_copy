In 2,6-dimethylphenol, the two methyl groups are at positions 2 and 6, both representing the ortho positions relative to the hydroxyl group.",
    "explanation": "In IUPAC nomenclature, the hydroxyl group is given priority and assigned position 1 on the aromatic ring. Other substituents are then numbered to yield the lowest possible locants. Thus, the location of a methyl group in m-cresol is at position 3 (3-methylphenol) while for 2,6-dimethylphenol, both methyl groups are on positions adjacent to the hydroxyl group (positions 2 and 6).

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For CH3–O–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3, the naming involves identifying the alkoxy group attached to a branched alkyl chain, resulting in methyl 2-methylpropyl ether. For C6H5–O–C2H5, the aromatic (phenyl) part is treated as a substituent, and the compound is named as ethoxybenzene. The key difference is that in alkyl ethers, both groups are alkyl chains with appropriate substituent naming, while in aryl ethers one group is an aromatic ring that does not change its name and the alkoxy substituent is named as an alkoxy group attached to the aromatic ring.",
    "explanation": "The IUPAC rules require that the name of an ether is based on the names of its two parts. For CH3–O–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3, the alkoxy group (–O–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3) is named as a branched alkyl (2-methylpropyl) and paired with the simpler alkyl (methyl). In contrast, in C6H5–O–C2H5, the oxygen is connected to a benzene ring; the benzene is named as phenyl when it acts as a substituent, and the ethyl group attached through oxygen forms an ethoxy substituent resulting in the name ethoxybenzene. This comparison highlights differences in how substituent groups are treated based on whether they are aromatic or aliphatic.",

The former has hydroxyl groups attached to internal carbons with potential for stereochemistry (having enantiomers or a meso form), whereas the latter has hydroxyl groups on every carbon, resulting in a more symmetrical molecule with less stereochemical complexity.",
    "explanation": "In CH3–CH(OH)–CH(OH)–CH3, the two –OH groups on carbons 2 and 3 yield butane-2,3-diol. This molecule may exhibit stereoisomerism depending on the relative configuration of the –OH groups. In contrast, HO–CH2–CH(OH)–CH2–OH, with the hydroxyl groups on carbons 1, 2, and 3 of propanol, is named propane-1,2,3-triol. The position of the –OH groups is clearly indicated by the numbering, and the symmetry of the molecule reduces possible stereoisomers.
