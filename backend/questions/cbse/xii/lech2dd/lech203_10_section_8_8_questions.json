    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Intermolecular hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acids is much stronger due to the ability to form cyclic dimers, where two acid molecules are linked by two hydrogen bonds. This dimerization persists even in the vapour phase, resulting in a significant increase in boiling points. Compared to aldehydes and ketones, which interact primarily through dipole-dipole forces, and alcohols which have only one -OH group available for hydrogen bonding, the dual hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acids leads to a more extensive network of interactions, thereby increasing the energy required to vaporize the molecules.",
    "explanation": "The presence of two functional groups in carboxylic acids allows for the formation of cyclic dimers via two hydrogen bonds, maintaining these interactions even in the vapour phase.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The molecular structure of carboxylic acids plays a crucial role in determining their physical properties. The presence of the carboxyl group (-COOH) enables hydrogen bonding, which leads to dimer formation, especially in the vapour phase. For short-chain acids, effective hydrogen bonding with water molecules results in good water solubility and notable odour due to volatility. In contrast, as the carbon chain length increases, the hydrophobic nature of the hydrocarbon segment diminishes water solubility, and reduced volatility causes the acids to be almost odourless. Additionally, the extensive hydrogen bonding network within these molecules accounts for higher boiling points compared to other compounds of similar molecular mass.",
    "explanation": "This evaluation outlines how different structural features such as the polar -COOH group, hydrophobic carbon chains, and the capacity to form dimers and hydrogen bonds collectively influence physical properties.
