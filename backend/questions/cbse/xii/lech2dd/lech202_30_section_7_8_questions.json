    "correct_answer": "Para nitrophenol",

    "correct_answer": "Due to para nitrophenol's lower boiling point from absence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding",

    "correct_answer": "Para nitrophenol is more steam volatile because it does not participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which increases the boiling point and decreases volatility of ortho nitrophenol.",
    "explanation": "The key difference is that ortho nitrophenol forms a stable intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the nitro group, raising its boiling point.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Steam distillation leverages the fact that when two immiscible liquids are distilled together, the total vapor pressure is the sum of the individual vapor pressures. For compounds like para nitrophenol, which have high boiling points normally, their co-distillation with water (boiling at 100Â°C) enables separation at lower temperatures. The absence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in para nitrophenol contributes to a relatively higher vapor pressure compared to the ortho isomer, ensuring its volatilization with steam. Additionally, the formation of an azeotrope with water in some cases lowers the effective boiling point, facilitating the separation process without thermal decomposition of the target compound.",
    "explanation": "By combining water and the target compound, the overall vapor pressure is increased, allowing the mixture to boil at a temperature lower than the boiling point of the pure high-boiling compound. This is particularly useful for temperature-sensitive substances. The difference in intermolecular interactions, as in the case of para versus ortho nitrophenol, allows selective separation based on volatility differences.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One limitation of steam distillation is that it relies on significant differences in volatility between components; if the nonvolatile isomer has a boiling point not sufficiently higher or if it forms a partial azeotrope, separation may be incomplete. Additionally, the presence of impurities or components that may co-distill with the target compound can complicate the process. Alternative methods such as fractional distillation, chromatography (e.g., HPLC), or recrystallization might be more effective. Chromatography, in particular, offers the advantage of separating compounds based on polarity differences and can be fine-tuned to account for minor differences in molecular properties.",
    "explanation": "While steam distillation is useful for separating compounds with marked differences in volatility, its effectiveness decreases when those differences are marginal or when the sample contains additional impurities. By using techniques like chromatography, which separates based on molecular interactions with the stationary phase, or recrystallization, which exploits differences in solubility, a cleaner separation may be achieved. Each method has its advantages and is chosen based on factors such as sample quantity, purity requirements, and available instrumentation.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The procedure would begin with preparing the mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols in a distillation flask along with a suitable amount of water. The mixture is heated gradually to initiate steam distillation. As the temperature reaches around 100Â°C, water vaporizes and carries the more volatile para nitrophenol with it, while the less volatile ortho nitrophenol remains in the flask. The volatile mixture is then condensed in a condenser and collected in a receiver. The separation is achieved because para nitrophenol, lacking intramolecular hydrogen bonding, has a lower boiling point and higher vapor pressure relative to ortho nitrophenol. After distillation, the organic layer can be separated from the water layer using a separatory funnel.",
    "explanation": "Each step of the procedure is designed to exploit the difference in boiling points imposed by intramolecular hydrogen bonding in ortho nitrophenol. Heating causes water to vaporize and form a co-distillation medium with para nitrophenol, reducing the effective boiling point of the latter. Cooling in a condenser allows the vapor mixture to condense, where phase separation techniques such as using a separatory funnel further purify the separated isomer.",
