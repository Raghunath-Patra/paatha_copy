    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary ones due to greater hyperconjugation and inductive effects. In the reaction, the initial secondary carbocation rearranges to a tertiary carbocation via a hydride shift, which then leads to the formation of the major product. This rearrangement ensures that the reaction proceeds via the most energetically favorable pathway.",
    "explanation": "Carbocation stability greatly influences SN1 reaction pathways.

    "correct_answer": "Step 1: Protonation of the hydroxyl group of 3-methylbutan-2-ol by HBr forms a better leaving group (water). Step 2: Loss of water produces a secondary carbocation. Step 3: A hydride shift from an adjacent carbon (third carbon) rearranges the secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation. Step 4: The nucleophile Br⁻ attacks the tertiary carbocation, forming the final product, CH3-C(Br)(CH3)-CH2-CH3.",
    "explanation": "Each step is driven by the goal of achieving maximum stability. Protonation makes the leaving group water, and the formation of the secondary carbocation sets the stage for a rearrangement. The hydride shift is a classical example of carbocation rearrangement to increase stability, followed by nucleophilic attack giving the substitution product.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In SN1 reactions, the rate-determining step is the formation of a carbocation intermediate. In the case of 3-methylbutan-2-ol reacting with HBr, the protonation of OH leads to the formation of a secondary carbocation which then rearranges to a more stable tertiary carbocation. This intermediate then reacts with Br⁻. In contrast, SN2 reactions involve a backside attack by the nucleophile in a single step without intermediate formation, which is less favorable for substrates that can stabilize carbocations. Thus, the inherent ability of 3-methylbutan-2-ol to form a stable carbocation through rearrangement makes the SN1 mechanism predominant.",
    "explanation": "SN1 mechanisms are characterized by two steps: ionization to form a carbocation and nucleophilic attack. The stability of the carbocation, enhanced by rearrangement, dictates the reaction path, favoring SN1 over SN2, which requires a direct attack on the substrate. The example highlights how carbocation rearrangements can shift product distribution and mechanism.",
