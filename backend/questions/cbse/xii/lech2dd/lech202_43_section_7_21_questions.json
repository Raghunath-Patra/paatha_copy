    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism involves an initial oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, followed by further oxidation to benzoic acid. KMnO₄ reacts with benzyl alcohol in an acidic medium, where the alcohol group is converted into a carbonyl group. The acid facilitates the formation of intermediate complexes and protonates oxygen sites, allowing for successive oxygen insertion into the molecule. Ultimately, the intermediate benzaldehyde is further oxidized, and after acidification, benzoic acid is obtained.",
    "explanation": "The reaction proceeds through multiple steps where KMnO₄ oxidizes the –CH₂OH group first to an aldehyde and then to a carboxylic acid. The acidic medium helps maintain the oxidizing strength of KMnO₄ and drives the reaction to completion. Protonation of intermediates increases the electrophilicity of the carbon center, enhancing the rate of oxidation.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "PCC is a milder oxidizing agent that converts primary alcohols to aldehydes without further oxidation, whereas acidified KMnO₄ is a much stronger oxidant that drives the oxidation all the way to the formation of carboxylic acids. The key difference lies in the reaction conditions and the inherent strengths of the oxidants. PCC avoids overoxidation due to its limited oxygen-transfer capacity and operates under conditions that do not favor further oxidation, while KMnO₄ under acidic conditions provides excess oxygen and a highly oxidative environment.",
    "explanation": "The comparison highlights that controlling the extent of oxidation is crucial in organic synthesis. PCC is used when the preservation of the aldehyde is desired, avoiding overoxidation, while acidified KMnO₄ is employed when a full oxidation to the acid is required. Factors such as reaction temperature, solvent, and pH control the reactivity and selectivity of the oxidizing reagents.",
