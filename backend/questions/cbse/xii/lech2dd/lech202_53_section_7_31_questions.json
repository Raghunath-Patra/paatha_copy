    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The methoxy (OCH3) group is an electron-donating substituent which increases the electron density of the benzene ring, specifically at the ortho and para positions. In Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acetylation, the formation of a carbocation or acylium ion electrophile is facilitated by a Lewis acid such as AlCl3. The enhanced electron density due to the OCH3 group makes the aromatic ring more nucleophilic and predisposed to attack the electrophile at the ortho and para positions. Steric hindrance usually makes the para position more accessible, leading to para substitution being the predominant product. This overall mechanism is a classic example of electrophilic aromatic substitution where the intermediate sigma complex is stabilized by resonance donation from the methoxy group.",
    "explanation": "The answer should cover the electron-donating effect of the OCH3 group, the role of the Lewis acid in generating the electrophile, the formation of the sigma complex, and the subsequent deprotonation to restore aromaticity. It should also note the preferential formation of the para product due to steric factors.",

In your answer, evaluate how reaction conditions, such as the use of ethanoic acid in bromination and the acid mixture in nitration, affect the position of substitution and the reaction's regioselectivity.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both nitration and bromination are electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions that occur on anisole due to its activated aromatic ring. In nitration, the reaction is carried out using nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid to generate a strong electrophile (the nitronium ion, NO2+), leading predominantly to para substitution due to both activation by the methoxy group and steric hindrance at the ortho positions. In bromination, particularly when conducted in an ethanoic acid medium, the bromine electrophile is generated in a less aggressive manner, and the solvent helps to moderate the reaction conditions. This can also favor para substitution, but sometimes a mixture may form if conditions vary. The acid medium in nitration is much stronger, pushing the reaction to completion with high regioselectivity, while the medium in bromination provides a balance between reactivity and selectivity.",
    "explanation": "The answer should compare the acids used (HNO3/H2SO4 versus ethanoic acid), the electrophiles formed (NO2+ versus Br+ or a bromonium ion), and the way the methoxy group directs the substitution. The analysis should also include how steric factors and reaction media influence product distribution.",
