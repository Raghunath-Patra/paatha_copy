    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The repulsion between the unshared (lone) electron pairs on oxygen compresses the C–O–H bond angle to be slightly smaller than the ideal tetrahedral angle. This occurs because lone pairs repel bonding pairs more strongly than bonding pairs repel each other, resulting in a reduction of the bond angle.",
    "explanation": "In a perfect tetrahedral geometry, bond angles are around 109.5°. However, in alcohols, the oxygen atom has two lone pairs that exert greater repulsion on the bonding pairs. This increased repulsion forces the bonded atoms (carbon and hydrogen) closer together, reducing the bond angle slightly below the ideal value. This concept is supported by VSEPR theory, which explains that electron pairs, especially lone pairs, tend to repel each other to minimize repulsive forces.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In phenols, the conjugation of the oxygen lone pair with the aromatic ring introduces partial double bond character to the C–O bond, resulting in a shorter bond length compared to alcohols. Additionally, the carbon atom in phenol is sp² hybridised, which also contributes to a shorter bond length compared to the sp³ hybridised carbon in alcohols.",
    "explanation": "The delocalisation of the oxygen's unshared electron pair in phenols allows for resonance stabilization with the aromatic system. This delocalisation creates a partial double bond character between the carbon and oxygen, strengthening and shortening the bond. Furthermore, the sp² hybridisation of the carbon in the aromatic ring results in a smaller bond length compared to the sp³ configuration in aliphatic alcohols. These factors together explain why phenols exhibit a C–O bond length of around 136 pm, shorter than the C–O bond length in methanol (142 pm).",
