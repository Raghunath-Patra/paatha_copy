    "correct_answer": "The stability of the carbocation intermediate directs the reaction pathway; in tertiary alcohols, the highly stable carbocation favors elimination (E1) over substitution reactions, leading to alkenes rather than ethers.",
    "explanation": "Carbocation stability is crucial because a more stable carbocation is more likely to undergo deprotonation to form an alkene rather than react via nucleophilic attack.

    "correct_answer": "Primary alcohols generally undergo a bimolecular substitution (SN2) reaction leading to ether formation under controlled conditions, while tertiary alcohols form stable carbocations that favor the unimolecular elimination (E1) mechanism resulting in alkene formation.",
    "explanation": "In the dehydration of primary alcohols, the less stable carbocation formation makes a bimolecular reaction pathway (SN2) more competitive, and under controlled low-temperature conditions, ether synthesis can occur. However, for tertiary alcohols, the formation of a highly stable tertiary carbocation predisposes the reaction to proceed via the E1 pathway, where elimination of a proton leads to alkene formation. Factors such as steric hindrance and carbocation rearrangement further prevent the formation of ethers from tertiary alcohols.",

    "correct_answer": "A viable alternative is the Williamson ether synthesis, where the alcohol is first converted to an alkoxide ion using a strong base. The alkoxide then reacts with a suitable primary alkyl halide to form the ether.",
    "explanation": "The Williamson ether synthesis circumvents the issues inherent in acid dehydration (such as carbocation formation and elimination reactions) by using a nucleophilic alkoxide which directly displaces a leaving group in an SN2 reaction. This method is particularly selective and well-suited for synthesizing unsymmetrical ethers. For secondary or tertiary alcohols, conversion to alkoxides may still be challenging due to steric effects, but conditions can be optimized, or protective groups may be used.",
