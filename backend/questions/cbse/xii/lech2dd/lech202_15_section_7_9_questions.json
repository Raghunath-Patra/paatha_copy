    "correct_answer": "The mechanism begins with the base-induced deprotonation of CHCl₃ by NaOH, generating the trichloromethane anion which subsequently undergoes alpha-elimination to form the dichlorocarbene intermediate (CCl₂). This electrophilic species then attacks the electron-rich phenolate ion at the ortho position to yield an intermediate adduct. Rearrangement and loss of a chloride ion occur, followed by hydrolysis during the workup to give o-hydroxybenzaldehyde.",
    "explanation": "This answer details the step-by-step formation of dichlorocarbene from chloroform, its reaction with the phenolate ion derived from phenol, and the transformation of intermediates through rearrangement and hydrolysis to form salicylaldehyde.

    "correct_answer": "The Reimer-Tiemann reaction is carried out in a basic medium (using NaOH) and involves the generation of a dichlorocarbene intermediate from CHCl₃, which reacts with phenol to yield o-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The balanced equation is: C₆H₅OH + CHCl₃ + 3 NaOH → C₇H₆O₂ + 3 NaCl + 2 H₂O. On the other hand, the Kolbe reaction is performed by electrolyzing aqueous solutions of carboxylates (e.g., sodium acetate), leading to decarboxylation and the formation of alkane products via radical coupling. Its representative equation is: 2 CH₃COO⁻ → CH₃CH₃ + 2 CO₂. The Reimer-Tiemann reaction proceeds via electrophilic aromatic substitution while the Kolbe reaction involves a radical pathway under electrolysis.",
