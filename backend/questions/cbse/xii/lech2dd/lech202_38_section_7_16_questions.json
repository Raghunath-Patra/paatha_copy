In addition to the resonance effect, a minor inductive electron-donating effect exists that further contributes to activation.",
    "explanation": "Initially, the lone pair on the oxygen can interact with the benzene pi system, forming resonance structures in which extra electron density is localized at the ortho and para positions. This enhanced electron density lowers the activation energy for the formation of the sigma complex (arenium ion) during electrophilic attack. The inductive effect, due to the electronegativity of the oxygen, would normally withdraw electrons; however, in the case of -OH substituted benzene, the resonance donation is the dominant effect. Detailed drawing of resonance structures shows movement of electrons from oxygen to the ring. Thus, both resonance and, to a lesser extent, inductive effects contribute to the overall activation.",

    "correct_answer": "The -OH group is an activating group because it donates electrons into the benzene ring via resonance, enhancing electron density (especially at ortho and para positions), while a nitro (NO₂) group is deactivating as it withdraws electrons by both resonance and inductive effects, reducing electron density at all positions.",
    "explanation": "In the -OH substituted benzene, the oxygen atom has lone pairs that can overlap with the aromatic pi system, providing extra electron density through resonance, which lowers the activation energy for electrophilic attack. The nitro group, however, has a strongly electron-withdrawing character; its resonance structures involve the delocalization of electrons away from the ring, and its inductive effect further decreases electron density. Thus, while the -OH group facilitates electrophilic substitution by stabilizing the sigma complex via additional electron donation, the nitro group destabilizes the intermediate by lowering the overall electron density in the ring. This contrast is fundamental in predicting reactivity and regioselectivity in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.",

Use a common electrophile, such as bromine in aqueous acetic acid, and monitor the reaction progress by measuring the consumption of bromine spectrophotometrically. It is expected that phenol, due to the -OH group activation, will react at a much faster rate, particularly at the ortho and para positions.",
    "explanation": "The experiment involves two parallel reactions: one using benzene and another using phenol. A fixed concentration of bromine in aqueous acetic acid is added to equimolar amounts of benzene and phenol at the same temperature. Reaction progress is monitored by measuring the absorbance of bromine at a specific wavelength using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The faster decrease in bromine concentration in the phenol reaction confirms the activating role of the -OH group. Additional analysis can involve isolation and characterization of the substitution products to verify regioselectivity (preferential formation of ortho and para bromophenol). This experimental design tests the hypothesis using controlled conditions and quantitative analysis.",
