    "correct_answer": "The polarisation of the carbonyl bond, due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen relative to carbon, causes the carbonyl carbon to be electrophilic and the oxygen nucleophilic. This polarization makes the carbonyl carbon susceptible to nucleophilic attack, which is a key step in many reaction mechanisms (e.g., nucleophilic additions in aldehydes and ketones). For example, in the addition of hydrogen cyanide to aldehydes and ketones, the nucleophilic cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. Similarly, the polar character explains why carbonyl compounds have higher dipole moments compared to ethers.",
    "explanation": "The carbonyl group exhibits a dipolar character because of resonance structures that show a partial positive charge on the carbon and a partial negative charge on the oxygen. This makes the carbon an electrophile, attracting nucleophiles in reactions such as addition to aldehydes and ketones. The reactivity differences between aldehydes and ketones can also be attributed to steric and electronic factors; aldehydes are generally more reactive due to less steric hindrance and a greater partial positive charge on the carbon.",

    "correct_answer": "The carbonyl group exhibits two primary resonance structures: one neutral, in which the carbon and oxygen share a double bond, and a dipolar form, where the carbon carries a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge. The dipolar resonance structure contributes to the electrophilic nature of the carbon and the nucleophilic character of the oxygen. This resonance stabilization plays a critical role in the reactivity of carbonyl compounds, influencing factors such as the susceptibility to nucleophilic attack and the overall polarity of the molecule. The balance between these resonance forms helps to explain why carbonyl compounds have significant dipole moments and unique reactivity patterns compared to other functional groups.",
    "explanation": "Resonance in the carbonyl group distributes electron density, resulting in a partial positive charge on the carbon and a partial negative charge on the oxygen. This distribution not only gives rise to the observed polarity but also affects reactivity. For instance, the electrophilic carbon is a prime target for nucleophiles, making reactions like nucleophilic addition common in carbonyl chemistry. Additionally, the stabilization offered by resonance can modify both the reaction rate and the mechanism by which these compounds participate in chemical processes.",
