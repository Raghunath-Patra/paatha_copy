In addition, for secondary and tertiary amines, the common system uses simple prefixes like 'ethylmethylamine' while the IUPAC system employs the use of 'N' locants, as in 'N-methylethanamine'.",
    "explanation": "The common system often uses a straightforward approach by combining the alkyl group name and 'amine' directly, which can sometimes be less descriptive about the actual position of the functional group. The IUPAC system, however, clearly states the position of the -NH₂ group by converting the alkane name (replacing 'e' with 'amine') and using numerical locants. This detailed approach is especially useful for molecules with multiple functional groups, like ethane-1,2-diamine where the positions of each amino group are specified.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the common system, secondary amines are named by combining the alkyl groups with 'amine' (e.g., ethylmethylamine). In contrast, the IUPAC system explicitly uses the locant 'N' to denote that the substituent is attached to the nitrogen atom, as in N-methylethanamine for CH₃NHCH₂CH₃. This use of 'N' clearly distinguishes substituents on nitrogen from substituents on the carbon chain, which is particularly important for molecules with complex structures or multiple functional groups.",
    "explanation": "The locant 'N' in IUPAC nomenclature serves to eliminate ambiguity about the point of attachment of substituents. For example, CH₃NHCH₂CH₃ is named N-methylethanamine, which makes it clear that the methyl group is attached to the nitrogen rather than to the carbon main-chain. This explicit designation contrasts with the common system, where such detail is often inferred or omitted, potentially leading to confusion in more complex molecules.",
