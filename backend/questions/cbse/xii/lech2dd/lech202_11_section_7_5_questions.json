    "correct_answer": "The regioselectivity in acid-catalyzed hydration of alkenes is controlled by Markovnikov's rule, which is a consequence of carbocation stability. In the hydration of propene, the proton from H₂O/H⁺ adds preferentially to the carbon with more hydrogens, forming a more stable secondary carbocation rather than a primary one. Factors such as carbocation rearrangements (if applicable), the nature of the solvent, and the stability provided by hyperconjugation and inductive effects, all contribute to the final distribution of products. In propene, the formation of a secondary carbocation leads directly to the formation of 2-propanol.",
    "explanation": "This answer should include a discussion of the stepwise mechanism involving protonation to form the carbocation, factors that stabilize the carbocation (like hyperconjugation from adjacent alkyl groups), and the attack by water. It should also consider solvent effects which help stabilize intermediates. Using propene serves as a clear example, since the reaction produces 2-propanol in agreement with Markovnikov's rule.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "NaBH₄ effectively reduces aldehydes and ketones by delivering a hydride ion to the carbonyl carbon, which is more electrophilic. In contrast, esters and carboxylic acids are more resistant due to the resonance stabilization of the carbonyl group and, in carboxylic acids, the acidic proton which can quench the hydride. The mechanism with aldehydes/ketones is straightforward with formation of an alkoxide intermediate that is then protonated to form the alcohol. For esters, the extra alkoxy group disperses the positive charge through resonance, lowering the electrophilicity, and thus NaBH₄ does not typically attack them under standard conditions.",
    "explanation": "This detailed answer should explore the fundamental differences in electrophilicity between aldehydes/ketones and esters/carboxylic acids.
