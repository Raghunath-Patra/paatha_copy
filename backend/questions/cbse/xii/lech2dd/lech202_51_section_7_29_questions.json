    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The resonance effect is critical in the activation of benzene rings by alkoxy groups. This effect allows the oxygen atom to donate electron density through pi-system overlap, effectively stabilizing the sigma complex during electrophilic substitution. As a result, the intermediate is lower in energy, which increases the overall rate of the reaction and directs the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Furthermore, the resonance effect contrasts with inductive effects, emphasizing the role of delocalized electrons in determining reactivity and directing outcomes in aromatic substitution reactions.",
    "explanation": "The alkoxy group’s ability to donate electrons via resonance significantly lowers the activation energy for electrophilic aromatic substitution. The resonance structures demonstrate delocalization of positive charge over the ring when the electrophile attacks at the ortho or para positions, enhancing stability.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "If electrophilic substitution were to occur at the meta position, the reaction would be less favorable because the intermediate would not benefit from resonance stabilization provided by the alkoxy group. This lack of stabilization would result in a higher energy transition state compared to ortho or para attacks. Consequently, the reaction might proceed more slowly, require harsher conditions, or lead to a lower yield. Alternative pathways might involve substrates with different directing groups or the use of catalysts that can bypass the unfavorable energy profile of the meta attack.",
    "explanation": "The resonance donation from the alkoxy group only stabilizes intermediates formed at the ortho and para positions effectively. In a meta attack scenario, the electrophile does not interact with the donated electron density, leading to a destabilized intermediate that is energetically unfavorable. This analysis helps illustrate why molecular structure influences reaction mechanisms in aromatic substitutions.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In synthetic organic chemistry, the ortho/para directing effect of the alkoxy group can be exploited to selectively introduce functional groups into the aromatic ring. For example, in the synthesis of pharmacologically active compounds, an aryl alkyl ether like anisole can undergo electrophilic substitution to introduce a nitro group at the para position. This nitro derivative can subsequently be reduced to an amino group, serving as a key intermediate for further transformations. Such strategies allow for precise control over substitution patterns, enabling the creation of complex, multi-functionalized molecules.",
