    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The unshared electron pair on nitrogen in amines significantly influences both geometry and reactivity. Geometrically, the lone pair occupies more space than bonding pairs, leading to a reduction of the bond angle from the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5° to around 108°. This distortion results in a pyramidal molecular shape. In terms of reactivity, the lone pair is available for donation, making amines nucleophilic and basic. This property is important in many chemical reactions, such as nucleophilic substitutions and acid-base reactions.",
    "explanation": "The presence of a lone pair not only alters the spatial arrangement of atoms around nitrogen but also enhances the chemical reactivity due to increased electron density. This dual effect is fundamental in understanding amine behavior in organic chemistry.",

    "correct_answer": "In both amines and ammonia, the nitrogen atom has five valence electrons. Through sp3 hybridization, one s and three p orbitals mix to form four equivalent orbitals. In ammonia, three of these orbitals form sigma bonds with hydrogen atoms and one holds the lone pair, resulting in a trigonal pyramidal shape. Similarly, in amines, three sp3 orbitals form bonds with either hydrogen or carbon atoms while the remaining orbital contains the lone pair, leading to a similar pyramidal geometry, albeit with different substituents.",
    "explanation": "The process of sp3 hybridization explains the molecular geometry and bonding in both ammonia and amines. The main difference lies in the nature of the substituents attached to nitrogen, which can influence the bond angles slightly due to varied steric and electronic effects.",
