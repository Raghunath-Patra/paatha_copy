    "explanation": "The reaction of ethers with hydrogen halides generally involves protonation of the oxygen to make it a better leaving group.

    "correct_answer": "Ethoxybenzene (an aryl alkyl ether) reacts by cleavage of the alkyl side via an SN2 mechanism because the aryl oxygen bond is strong and does not undergo SN1, while a simple dialkyl ether typically can react by either SN1 or SN2 depending on the substituents present. The electron-rich aromatic ring in ethoxybenzene further prevents the formation of a stable carbocation.",
    "explanation": "The cleavage of ethoxybenzene by HBr occurs through an SN2 pathway on the alkyl group because the phenyl group does not stabilize a positive charge well. In contrast, dialkyl ethers may proceed through SN1 if one of the alkyl groups is tertiary or through SN2 if both are primary. The difference is due to the stability of potential carbocation intermediates and the bond strengths in aryl versus alkyl ethers.",

    "explanation": "The bulky tert-butyl group cannot easily be attacked by a nucleophile, and thus the reaction proceeds through an ionization step that forms a stable tertiary carbocation.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Firstly, under the strongly acidic conditions, the ethoxide oxygen is protonated, leading to cleavage of the C–O bond and forming the p-nitrobenzyl carbocation. Water then attacks this carbocation, generating p-nitrobenzyl alcohol. Subsequently, the presence of concentrated H₂SO₄ and HNO₃ leads to nitration of the aromatic ring. The existing nitro substituent deactivates the ring but directs new nitro groups mainly to the ortho positions relative to the hydroxymethyl group. Due to steric and electronic factors, the most favorable substitution occurs at the position leading to 2,4-dinitrobenzyl alcohol.",
    "explanation": "This reaction proceeds via the initial formation of a benzyl carbocation, stabilized by resonance. The subsequent attack by water affords p-nitrobenzyl alcohol, which then undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution under nitrating conditions. The mechanism involves formation of the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺) as the electrophile, with substitution occurring at the most accessible positions on the deactivated aromatic ring. The directing effects of the substituents determine the final regioselectivity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Regioselectivity in the acid-catalyzed cleavage of ethers is influenced by both electronic effects and steric hindrance. In aliphatic ethers, a more substituted carbon can stabilize a carbocation intermediate, favoring an SN1 mechanism, while primary carbons usually react via SN2. In aromatic ethers like ethoxybenzene, the aromatic ring cannot form a stable carbocation and thus the reaction occurs via SN2 attack on the alkyl chain. Additionally, electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring (or in benzyl systems) can further influence the site of cleavage and subsequent reactions such as nucleophilic substitution or electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The interplay of these factors determines the observed product distribution.",
    "explanation": "Electronic effects such as carbocation stability and the nature of substituents (electron-donating or withdrawing) play major roles in influencing which bond in the ether is cleaved. Steric factors further modify the reaction pathway by hindering nucleophilic attack. For example, the cleavage of (CH₃)₃C-OC₂H₅ occurs preferentially by formation of a tertiary carbocation whereas in ethoxybenzene, steric and electronic constraints lead to attack on the ethyl side. This discussion demonstrates how regioselectivity arises from competing mechanistic pathways based on the substrate structure.",
