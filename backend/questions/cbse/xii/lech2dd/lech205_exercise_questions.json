    "correct_answer": "Glycogen is a highly branched storage polysaccharide found in animals, whereas starch is the primary storage polysaccharide in plants. Glycogen has more frequent branch points (α-1,6 glycosidic bonds) compared to starch, which is composed of two components: amylose (a linear polymer with α-1,4 linkages) and amylopectin (a branched polymer with both α-1,4 and less frequent α-1,6 linkages).",
    "explanation": "Glycogen's structure, with its extensive branching, allows for rapid mobilization of glucose when needed by the body. Starch, being the plant storage form, exists as amylose and amylopectin, with amylopectin having fewer branch points than glycogen, which affects its solubility and rate of enzymatic breakdown.",

    "explanation": "The difference in the configuration of the glycosidic bond and the form of glucose (alpha in starch, beta in cellulose) leads to differences in solubility and digestibility.

    "correct_answer": "When D-glucose is treated with HI, it is reduced to n-hexane. Treatment with bromine water leads to oxidation forming gluconic acid, and on oxidation with HNO₃, D-glucose is converted into saccharic acid.",
    "explanation": "HI causes the reduction of glucose, demonstrating that all six carbons are in a straight chain. Bromine water oxidizes the aldehyde group to a carboxylic acid (gluconic acid), and further oxidation by HNO₃ produces a dicarboxylic acid (saccharic acid), indicating the presence of both primary and aldehyde groups.",

    "explanation": "The open chain form of glucose does not account for the fact that glucose does not show expected reactivity for free carbonyl groups.
