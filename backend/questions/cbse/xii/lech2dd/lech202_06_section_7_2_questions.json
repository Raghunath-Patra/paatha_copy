    "correct_answer": "Cyclic alcohols are named with the prefix 'cyclo' followed by the name of the ring, with the hydroxyl group assumed to be at carbon-1. For example, cyclohexanol indicates that an –OH group is attached to carbon-1 of a six-membered ring. In the case of substituted cyclic alcohols like 2-methylcyclopentanol, the ring is numbered starting from the carbon bearing the –OH group (assigned as carbon-1), and the methyl substituent is located at carbon-2. For substituted phenols, common nomenclature uses terms such as ortho, meta, and para to indicate the relative positions of substituents, although IUPAC nomenclature uses numerical locants, for example, 2-methylphenol for o-cresol.",
