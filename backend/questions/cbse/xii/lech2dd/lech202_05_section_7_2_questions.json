    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The oxidation of allylic alcohols typically involves the formation of reactive intermediates such as allylic radicals or cations. These intermediates are stabilized by resonance, as the adjacent double bond allows delocalization of the charge. This stabilization lowers the activation energy for oxidation. The mechanism may involve single electron transfer or the formation of a complex with the oxidizing agent, leading to a more efficient oxidation compared to non-allylic alcohols. Detailed mechanisms often outline the step-by-step electron movement and subsequent rearrangements that are facilitated by the allylic structure.",

    "correct_answer": "Both allylic and benzylic alcohols experience resonance stabilization due to the presence of an adjacent unsaturated system; however, benzylic alcohols are attached to an aromatic ring, offering greater delocalization and stabilization. This results in benzylic alcohols generally being more reactive toward oxidation and nucleophilic substitution reactions. Conversely, allylic alcohols, having a less extensive resonance network, display moderate reactivity. The comparison should include details on structural influences, intermediate stabilization, and typical reaction behavior.",
    "explanation": "This answer compares the delocalization effects provided by an aromatic ring versus a simple double bond. The benzylic position typically provides greater resonance stabilization, which in turn alters reaction rates and mechanisms compared to the allylic position.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One experimental approach involves the hydroboration-oxidation sequence. Start with an alkene such as 1,3-butadiene. In the first step, treat the alkene with borane (BH₃) under inert conditions to achieve regioselective addition forming a trialkylborane intermediate. Then, oxidize this intermediate with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to produce the allylic alcohol. The reaction conditions are mild to prevent rearrangements and ensure high selectivity. The work-up includes neutralization, extraction, and purification by distillation or chromatography. This approach is justified by the high regioselectivity and efficiency of the hydroboration-oxidation process.",
