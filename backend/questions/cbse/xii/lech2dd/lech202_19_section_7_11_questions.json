    "correct_answer": "Because p‐nitrobromobenzene contains a good leaving group (bromide) and the nitro substituent withdraws electron density, stabilizing the intermediate during nucleophilic aromatic substitution. In contrast, p‐nitrosodium phenoxide lacks an effective leaving group, making the reaction much less favorable.",
    "explanation": "The bromide ion in p‐nitrobromobenzene is an excellent leaving group, and the electron-withdrawing nitro group activates the aromatic ring toward nucleophilic attack. p‐Nitrosodium phenoxide, however, does not offer the same stabilization or leaving group ability, resulting in lower reactivity.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism begins with the methoxide ion attacking the aromatic carbon attached to the bromine in p‐nitrobromobenzene. This attack forms a negatively charged intermediate, known as the Meisenheimer complex, which is stabilized by the electron-withdrawing nitro group at the para position. Once the intermediate is formed, the bromide ion is expelled as a leaving group, resulting in the formation of 1‐methoxy‐4‐nitrobenzene.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "correct_answer": "p‐Nitrobromobenzene paired with CH3ONa is more reactive because the bromide ion is a superior leaving group, and CH3ONa provides a strong nucleophile (methoxide ion) that can effectively attack the aromatic ring. On the other hand, p‐nitrosodium phenoxide paired with CH3Br does not favorably form the reactive intermediate required for nucleophilic aromatic substitution because CH3Br is an electrophilic reagent and the phenoxide does not activate the ring or provide a good leaving group.",
    "explanation": "The reaction mechanism for the first set involves nucleophilic aromatic substitution with clear stabilization of the Meisenheimer complex by the nitro group. The alternative set fails due to the inappropriate nature of both the electrophile (CH3Br) and the leaving group in p‐nitrosodium phenoxide, making it mechanistically unsound for forming 1‐methoxy‐4‐nitrobenzene.",

Variables like temperature, reactant concentration, and solvent polarity should be controlled. Calibration curves for both reactants and product would allow kinetic analysis.
