    "correct_answer": "Alkyl halides have higher molecular weights and increased polarity relative to their corresponding hydrocarbons because of the halogen substituent. The increased molecular weight enhances van der Waals forces, while the polarity introduces dipole-dipole attractions. These combined effects result in significantly higher boiling points for alkyl halides compared to their nonpolar, lighter hydrocarbon counterparts.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Haloalkanes are poorly soluble in water because dissolving them requires breaking the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules, and the interactions that form between water and haloalkane molecules are too weak to compensate for this energy input. In contrast, organic solvents have similar types of intermolecular forces to those of haloalkanes, which means that the energy required to break existing interactions is comparable to the energy released upon mixing, resulting in better solubility.",
    "explanation": "The process of dissolution in water involves disrupting water-water hydrogen bonds. Since haloalkanes do not form strong hydrogen bonds with water, the net energy change is unfavorable. However, in organic solvents, the intermolecular interactions are of similar strength, making the mixing process energetically more favorable.",

    "correct_answer": "Isomerism and molecular symmetry significantly affect the melting points of dihalobenzenes. While isomeric dihalobenzenes exhibit similar boiling points due to comparable intermolecular forces in the liquid phase, the melting points vary considerably. The para-isomer, being more symmetric, packs more efficiently into a crystal lattice, resulting in a higher melting point compared to the less symmetric ortho- and meta-isomers.",
    "explanation": "The efficiency of crystal packing is directly influenced by molecular symmetry. The para-isomer, with its balanced structure, allows for a more ordered and stable crystal lattice, which requires a higher temperature to disrupt.
