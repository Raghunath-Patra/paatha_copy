    "correct_answer": "Williamson synthesis is limited by the fact that secondary and tertiary alkyl halides tend to undergo elimination (E2) reactions instead of substitution. For example, attempting to synthesize t‑butyl ethyl ether using t‑butyl halide usually results in elimination to form 2‑methylpropene rather than the desired ether.",
    "explanation": "The reaction conditions for Williamson synthesis favor SN2 reactions. However, sterically hindered or tertiary alkyl halides undergo elimination rather than substitution, thereby limiting the scope of the method for synthesizing certain unsymmetrical ethers.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Propan-1-ol is first deprotonated with sodium to form sodium propoxide. Then, it reacts with 1‑chloropropane via an SN2 reaction to form 1‑propoxypropane. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by the propoxide ion on the electrophilic carbon in 1‑chloropropane, displacing chloride ion and forming the ether.",
    "explanation": "The process is the classic Williamson ether synthesis. The alkoxide is generated by reaction with metal (Na), and the subsequent SN2 reaction ensures inversion of configuration at the electrophilic carbon. The reaction conditions must be controlled to avoid elimination side reactions.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Acid dehydration of secondary or tertiary alcohols usually leads to elimination reactions forming alkenes rather than substitution to give ethers, due to the formation of stable carbocations that favor elimination.",
    "explanation": "Secondary and tertiary alcohols undergo dehydration under acidic conditions predominantly via the E1 mechanism, which leads to alkene formation, thereby making the method unsuitable for ether synthesis.",

    "explanation": "Ethers react with hydrogen halides by cleaving the C–O bond. The reaction generally proceeds via protonation of the ether oxygen followed by nucleophilic attack by iodide.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The alkoxy group (–OR) donates electron density into the aromatic ring by resonance, activating it toward electrophilic substitution. Its lone pair is delocalized into the ring, increasing electron density particularly at the ortho and para positions, which makes these positions more reactive to electrophiles.",
    "explanation": "The +M (mesomeric) effect of the alkoxy group increases electron density on the ring, particularly at the ortho and para positions. This not only activates the ring but also directs electrophilic attack to these positions due to the enhanced electron density.",

For (iv), 2‑cyclohexylpropene can be hydrated to yield 2‑cyclohexylpropan‑2‑ol.",
    "explanation": "The synthesis requires selecting the correct alkene substrate that, upon hydration, gives the desired regiochemistry and stereochemistry.
