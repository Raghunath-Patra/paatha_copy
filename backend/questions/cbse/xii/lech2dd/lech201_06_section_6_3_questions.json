    "correct_answer": "While the dipole moment remains close in value, there is a slight decrease from CH3–F (1.847 D) to CH3–I (1.636 D). This trend is influenced by the decreasing electronegativity difference and increasing bond length.",
    "explanation": "The dipole moment is affected by both the electronegativity difference and the distance between charges.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "As the halogen atom increases in size from F to I, the carbon–halogen bond length increases due to the larger atomic radius. This increase in bond length weakens the bond, leading to a lower bond enthalpy. Periodic trends such as increasing atomic size and decreasing electronegativity differences explain the observed decrease in bond strength. The chemical implication is that alkyl halides with larger halogens are generally more reactive in reactions that involve breaking the C–X bond.",
    "explanation": "The increase in halogen size results in an increase in the bond length because the larger electron cloud of the halogen atom means that the bonding electrons are further from the nucleus of carbon. This greater distance reduces the overlap between the orbitals of carbon and the halogen, weakening the bond, as reflected in a lower bond enthalpy. These trends are consistent with periodic properties where atomic size increases down a group and electronegativity decreases, affecting chemical reactivity and stability.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The polarity in alkyl halides, due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon and the halogen, plays a crucial role in determining chemical reactivity. The partial positive charge on carbon makes it susceptible to nucleophilic attack, which is exploited in many synthetic reactions. Additionally, trends in bond enthalpy and dipole moment influence reaction conditions; for example, a higher bond enthalpy requires more energy to break the bond, while the dipole moment affects the molecule’s interactions with solvents and other reactants. Therefore, understanding these trends helps chemists predict reactivity, optimize synthesis, and design reaction pathways.",
    "explanation": "Polarity in alkyl halides is a key factor in reaction mechanisms such as substitution and elimination reactions. The partial charges facilitate interactions with nucleophiles and electrophiles. Furthermore, as the bond enthalpy decreases with increasing halogen size, the ease of bond cleavage also increases, which can influence reaction kinetics. The dipole moment, although slightly varying, affects how these molecules interact with polar solvents and reagents, adding another critical dimension to reactivity and synthesis.",
