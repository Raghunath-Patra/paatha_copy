Side reactions may include polymerization of styrene under acidic conditions.",
    "explanation": "This detailed mechanism involves initial protonation of the double bond in styrene to generate a relatively stable benzylic carbocation.

    "explanation": "For SN2 reactions, selecting a less sterically hindered alkyl halide (typically primary) and using a good leaving group are critical.

Monitor the reaction progress and determine product yield using techniques like gas chromatography. Control variables include reaction time, solvent volume, and concentrations to isolate the effect of the leaving group on the SN2 reaction rate.",
    "explanation": "A controlled experimental design involves keeping all factors constant except the type of leaving group.
