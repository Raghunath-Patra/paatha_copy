    "correct_answer": "Bimolecular dehydration is not appropriate for preparing ethyl methyl ether because the reaction requires the formation of a protonated alcohol intermediate and nucleophilic attack by an alcohol molecule. In the case of mixing two different alcohols (e.g., ethanol and methanol), the competing formation of alkenes and the potential for mixed reactivity lead to low selectivity, making the reaction inefficient for forming unsymmetrical ethers.",

    "explanation": "The reaction starts with the formation of sodium alkoxide from an alcohol and sodium, and then an SN2 nucleophilic substitution occurs between the alkoxide and a primary alkyl halide to form the ether.

    "correct_answer": "The oxygen atom in ethers is polar and has lone pairs, enabling it to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Although ethers do not exhibit intermolecular hydrogen bonding among themselves as alcohols do (leading to lower boiling points), they are still water-miscible because of their ability to interact with water through hydrogen bonding.",
    "explanation": "Even though ethers have boiling points comparable to alkanes, their oxygen atom can interact with water molecules. This hydrogen bonding with water enhances their solubility, making their miscibility properties similar to those of alcohols of comparable molecular mass.",

    "correct_answer": "The mechanism of anisole cleavage with HI involves protonation of the ether oxygen to form a methylphenyl oxonium ion, followed by nucleophilic attack by I⁻ at the methyl group. The reaction proceeds via an SN2 pathway: \nStep 1: C₆H₅OCH₃ + HI ⇄ C₆H₅O⁺(H)CH₃ + I⁻ \nStep 2: I⁻ attacks the methyl carbon, yielding CH₃I and C₆H₅OH. \nBalanced Reaction: C₆H₅OCH₃ + HI → CH₃I + C₆H₅OH.",
    "explanation": "Protonation of the oxygen makes the adjacent C–O bond more labile. Iodide, being a good nucleophile, attacks the less sterically hindered methyl carbon via an SN2 mechanism, resulting in the cleavage of the bond.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Butan-1-ol has a higher boiling point (390 K) compared to ethoxyethane (307.6 K) and n-pentane (309.1 K) due to hydrogen bonding. Ethoxyethane and n-pentane have similar boiling points because although ethoxyethane is polar, its intermolecular forces are not as strong as the hydrogen bonds in alcohols. Water miscibility of ethoxyethane and butan-1-ol is also comparable (about 7.5–9 g/100 mL) due to the ability of the oxygen atom to form hydrogen bonds with water, while n-pentane is essentially immiscible because it is nonpolar.",
    "explanation": "Alcohols can engage in hydrogen bonding, significantly increasing their boiling points, whereas ethers cannot form such strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds among themselves. However, both ethers and alcohols are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water, leading to similar miscibility. n-Pentane, being nonpolar, does not interact well with water.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To prepare t‑butyl ethyl ether via Williamson synthesis, one should use t‑butoxide ion instead of ethoxide. The correct reaction is: (CH₃)₃C–O⁻ Na⁺ + CH₃CH₂Cl → (CH₃)₃C–O–CH₂CH₃ + NaCl. This works because the t‑butoxide ion is derived from t‑butanol, making it a better nucleophile for substitution with a primary alkyl halide. In contrast, using sodium ethoxide with t‑butyl chloride results in elimination reactions because sodium ethoxide is a strong base and the tertiary halide (t‑butyl chloride) readily undergoes E1 elimination to form 2‑methylpropene.",
    "explanation": "The key is selecting the appropriate combination of nucleophile and alkyl halide. Primary alkyl halides favor SN2 reactions, while tertiary alkyl halides are prone to elimination. Therefore, employing t‑butoxide with ethyl chloride ensures that the substitution reaction proceeds correctly, whereas the reverse combination leads predominantly to elimination.",
