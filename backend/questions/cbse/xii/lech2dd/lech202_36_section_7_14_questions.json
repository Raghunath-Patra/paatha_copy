    "correct_answer": "One reaction involves phenol reacting with NaOH forming sodium phenoxide and water, while the second reaction involves phenol reacting with metallic sodium to produce sodium phenoxide and hydrogen gas. In contrast, ethanol reacts with bases very weakly due to the absence of resonance stabilization in the ethoxide ion. This difference in behavior is attributed to the resonance stabilization present in phenol, which delocalizes the negative charge in the phenoxide ion and significantly enhances its acidity compared to ethanol.",
    "explanation": "The first reaction: C6H5OH + NaOH → C6H5ONa + H2O, shows deprotonation by a base, while the second reaction: 2 C6H5OH + 2 Na → 2 C6H5ONa + H2, involves a reaction with sodium metal. Both reactions confirm that phenol can lose a proton to form a stable conjugate base.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Phenol, with a pKa near 10, is more acidic than ethanol, which has a pKa around 16. The higher acidity of phenol is due to the resonance stabilization of the phenoxide ion formed upon deprotonation, as shown in the reactions: C6H5OH + NaOH → C6H5ONa + H2O and 2 C6H5OH + 2 Na → 2 C6H5ONa + H2. Ethanol does not display such stabilization, which results in a less stable ethoxide ion and therefore lower acidity.",
