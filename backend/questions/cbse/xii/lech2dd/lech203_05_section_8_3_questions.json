    "explanation": "Dipole-dipole interactions occur when the positive end of one polar molecule is attracted to the negative end of another.

    "explanation": "Alcohols can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds because of their –OH group, which significantly raises their boiling points. In contrast, aldehydes and ketones, despite having polar carbonyl groups that can engage in dipole-dipole interactions, lack the capability for hydrogen bonding with themselves.

    "explanation": "The comparison shows that while n-butane and methoxyethane, despite being similar in mass to propanal and acetone, have lower boiling points because they lack strong polar interactions. Propanal and acetone have higher boiling points due to prominent dipole-dipole interactions from their carbonyl groups, and propan-1-ol, an alcohol, has the highest boiling point because of hydrogen bonding.

    "correct_answer": "Hydrogen bonding with water improves the solubility of lower aldehydes and ketones by enabling strong interactions between the carbonyl oxygen and water molecules. As the alkyl chain length increases, the hydrophobic portion of the molecule grows, decreasing overall solubility in water. Therefore, the hypothesis is that longer alkyl chains will reduce water solubility due to enhanced hydrophobic effects.",
    "explanation": "Lower aldehydes and ketones have small alkyl groups and polar carbonyl groups, which allow them to form hydrogen bonds with water, making them completely miscible. When the alkyl chain length increases, the nonpolar region becomes larger and less compatible with water, thereby diminishing the strength and number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed. This results in lower solubility. This hypothesis can be tested by systematically investigating compounds with varying chain lengths.",
