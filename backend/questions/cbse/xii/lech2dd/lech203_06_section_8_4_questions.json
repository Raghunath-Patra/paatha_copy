    "correct_answer": "Benzaldehyde is less reactive than propanal because the resonance stabilization involving the benzene ring delocalizes electron density, reducing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. This makes the carbon less attractive to nucleophiles compared to the unsubstituted carbonyl of propanal.",
    "explanation": "In benzaldehyde, the conjugation between the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring disperses the positive charge on the carbonyl carbon, thus lowering its effective electrophilicity.

An example is formaldehyde reacting in the presence of concentrated KOH to form methanol and potassium formate.",

This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde or ketone (aldol). Upon heating, the aldol loses a molecule of water to yield an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.",
    "explanation": "The reaction occurs in two stages: first, the formation of an aldol (or ketol) via nucleophilic attack of an enolate; second, dehydration, which is an elimination process that produces the conjugated enone.

    "correct_answer": "Clemmensen reduction uses zinc amalgam with concentrated hydrochloric acid and is performed under acidic conditions. It reduces the carbonyl group to a methylene group while maintaining other acid-stable groups. The Wolff-Kishner reduction uses hydrazine followed by heating with strong base in a high boiling solvent like ethylene glycol under basic conditions to achieve the same reduction. The choice between them depends on the substrate sensitivity; for example, substrates that are acid-labile are best reduced using Wolff-Kishner conditions.",
    "explanation": "Clemmensen reduction involves the formation of a diol intermediate that is further reduced, which requires acidic conditions and is suitable for compounds stable in acid. Wolff-Kishner reduction forms a hydrazone intermediate that undergoes deprotonation and nitrogen elimination in basic medium, making it ideal for acid-sensitive substrates.

    "correct_answer": "Tollens' test oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylate ions while reducing silver ions to metallic silver, forming a mirror; ketones do not react. Fehling's test also oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylates, resulting in a red-brown precipitate of Cu₂O; it typically does not work for aromatic aldehydes. The iodoform reaction is positive for methyl ketones (and compounds that can be oxidized to methyl ketones) by forming a yellow precipitate of CHI₃. The reactions differ due to the varying oxidizability and the presence of the CH₃CO- group which is specifically required for the iodoform reaction.",
    "explanation": "Aldehydes are easily oxidized, which is exploited in both Tollens' and Fehling's tests. In Tollens' test, the soluble silver complex is reduced to silver metal. In Fehling's test, copper (II) is reduced to copper (I) oxide.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a cross aldol condensation between ethanal and propanal, two major products can form: when ethanal acts as the nucleophile and propanal as the electrophile, the product is CH3CH=CHCOCH2CH3 (a mixed α,β-unsaturated aldehyde); conversely, when propanal serves as the nucleophile and ethanal as the electrophile, the product is CH3CH2CH=CHCHO. The balanced equations may be represented as follows: 1) CH3CHO + CH3CH2CHO ⇌ CH3CH(OH)CH2CH2CHO (aldol addition product) → CH3CH=CHCH2CHO + H2O and 2) CH3CH2CHO + CH3CHO ⇌ CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2CHO (alternate aldol) → CH3CH2CH=CHCHO + H2O.",
    "explanation": "In cross aldol reactions, the interplay of nucleophilic enolate formation from one aldehyde and the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the other leads to multiple products.
