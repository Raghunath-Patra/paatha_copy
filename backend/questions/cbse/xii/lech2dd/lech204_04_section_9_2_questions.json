    "explanation": "While electron-donating groups increase the electron density on nitrogen, making the amine more basic, more bulky substituents can hinder the approach of electrophiles.

    "explanation": "The substitution increases the electron density through inductive effects, improving the ability of the nitrogen to donate its lone pair.
