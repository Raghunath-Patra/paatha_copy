    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reaction begins with protonation of the alkene by an acid (such as H2SO4), forming a carbocation intermediate at the most substituted carbon. In 2-cyclohexylpropene, protonation occurs to generate a tertiary carbocation. Next, water acts as a nucleophile, attacking this carbocation to form an oxonium ion intermediate. Finally, deprotonation of the oxonium ion yields 2-cyclohexylpropan-2-ol. Each step is facilitated by the acidic medium, which increases the electrophilic character of the alkene and stabilizes the intermediates.",
    "explanation": "The mechanism follows the classic acid-catalysed hydration pathway: protonation of the alkene, nucleophilic attack by water, and deprotonation of the oxonium ion. The formation and stabilization of the tertiary carbocation are crucial for ensuring the correct structure of the final alcohol.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A viable pathway involves starting with 4-methyl-2-pentene as the alkene. Under acid-catalysed hydration (using a diluted acid such as H2SO4 in water), the alkene undergoes Markovnikov addition where the OH group is added to the more substituted carbon. The mechanism initiates with protonation to form a carbocation intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by water and subsequent deprotonation, yielding 4-methylpentan-2-ol. The choice of 4-methyl-2-pentene is justified by its ability to direct the addition in accordance with Markovnikov's rule. Stereochemical considerations in this reaction are minimal due to the nature of the carbocation intermediate, though care should be taken if any chiral centers are formed.",
    "explanation": "The synthetic scheme relies on the established principles of electrophilic addition. By choosing 4-methyl-2-pentene, the regioselectivity dictated by Markovnikov's rule ensures that the OH group is installed at the correct position. Reaction conditions such as low temperature and controlled acid concentration help prevent side reactions like carbocation rearrangement.",
