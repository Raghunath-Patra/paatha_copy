    "correct_answer": "(i) In chlorobenzene, the involvement of the chlorine atom in resonance with the aromatic ring results in partial cancellation of the dipole moment, whereas in cyclohexyl chloride the chlorine is bonded to an sp3 carbon without delocalization; (ii) Despite being polar, alkyl halides have low solubility in water because the energy required to disrupt water’s strong hydrogen bonding network is not compensated by the weak interactions between water and the haloalkane; (iii) Grignard reagents react violently with water (or any source of acidic protons) so they must be prepared and handled under strictly anhydrous conditions to prevent deactivation.",
    "explanation": "The structural and electronic differences in chlorobenzene result in a lower net dipole than in cyclohexyl chloride. The non-polar character imparted by the large hydrocarbon portion in alkyl halides makes them immiscible in water, which has strong hydrogen bonding.

    "correct_answer": "An acceptable answer is: (a) n-Butyl bromide (CH3CH2CH2CH2Br); (b) on treatment with alcoholic KOH gives 1-butene (CH3CH2CH=CH2); (c) subsequent addition of HBr to 1-butene yields 2-bromobutane (CH3CHBrCH2CH3), an isomer of n-butyl bromide; (d) the Wurtz reaction of (a) with sodium yields n-octane (CH3(CH2)6CH3). The equations are: CH3CH2CH2CH2Br + alcoholic KOH → CH3CH2CH=CH2 + H2O + KBr; CH3CH2CH=CH2 + HBr → CH3CHBrCH2CH3; 2 CH3CH2CH2CH2Br + 2 Na → CH3(CH2)6CH3 + 2 NaBr.",
    "explanation": "The reactions illustrate elimination (E2) of a primary alkyl halide with alcoholic KOH to form an alkene, followed by electrophilic addition of HBr (which yields a regioisomer due to Markovnikov's rule) and finally a coupling reaction (Wurtz reaction) where two molecules of the alkyl halide couple to form a higher alkane.",

    "question_text": "What happens when (i) n-butyl chloride is treated with alcoholic KOH, (ii) bromobenzene is treated with Mg in the presence of dry ether, (iii) chlorobenzene is subjected to hydrolysis, (iv) ethyl chloride is treated with aqueous KOH, (v) methyl bromide is treated with sodium in the presence of dry ether, (vi) methyl chloride is treated with KCN?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(i) n-Butyl chloride undergoes elimination to form butene; (ii) bromobenzene reacts with Mg in dry ether to form phenylmagnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent); (iii) chlorobenzene is very resistant to hydrolysis and does not react significantly; (iv) ethyl chloride undergoes nucleophilic substitution with aqueous KOH to form ethanol; (v) methyl bromide reacts via the Wurtz reaction to form ethane; (vi) methyl chloride reacts with KCN in an SN2 reaction to yield methyl cyanide (acetonitrile).",
    "explanation": "The outcomes are determined by the substrate structure and reaction conditions. Primary alkyl halides favor elimination in alcoholic KOH, aromatic halides like chlorobenzene resist hydrolysis due to strong C–Cl bonds and resonance stabilization, while Grignard reagents form readily from aryl bromides in dry ether. The Wurtz reaction and nucleophilic substitutions follow standard mechanistic pathways in these conditions.",
