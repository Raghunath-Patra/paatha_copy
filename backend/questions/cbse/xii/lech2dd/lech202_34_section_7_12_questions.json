Finally, acidification of sodium phenoxide: C₆H₅ONa + HCl → C₆H₅OH + NaCl yields phenol. Each step requires specific conditions; sulfonation occurs under controlled temperature using conc. H₂SO₄, while alkaline fusion requires high temperature (molten NaOH) to drive off the sulfonic group, and the acidification step is performed under mild conditions to prevent side reactions.",

However, the process has limitations including the need for high temperatures during alkaline fusion and the handling of corrosive reagents. In contrast, the cumene process, while more complex and involving oxidation of cumene, is often more economically viable for large-scale production but introduces challenges with byproduct management.
