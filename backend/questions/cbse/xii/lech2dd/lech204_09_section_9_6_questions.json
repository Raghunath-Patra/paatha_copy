    "correct_answer": "Aniline has a higher pKb value because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom in aniline is delocalized into the aromatic benzene ring via resonance. This delocalization makes the lone pair less available for protonation, thereby reducing its basicity compared to aliphatic amines where the lone pair is localized.",
    "explanation": "In aliphatic amines, the nitrogen’s lone pair is not involved in resonance and is more readily available to accept protons.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In aqueous solution, solvation stabilizes the ammonium ions formed from amines. Primary ammonium ions, having more hydrogen atoms available, can form more hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thereby achieving greater stabilization. Secondary ions form fewer hydrogen bonds, and tertiary ions, due to steric hindrance, form the least. This differential solvation influences the apparent basicity, often making primary amines stronger bases in water despite the inductive effects of alkyl groups.",
    "explanation": "The stability of the ammonium ion is not determined solely by the inductive effect; solvation plays a crucial role. More extensive hydrogen bonding in primary ammonium ions stabilizes the ion, thereby shifting the equilibrium towards ion formation, which results in a higher observed basicity in aqueous media.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Pyridine is used in the acylation reaction of amines because it acts as a base to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction, thereby driving the equilibrium toward the product side. This acylation reaction converts an amine (-NH₂) into an amide (-NHCO-), which is less reactive. This transformation is valuable in synthesis as it serves both to protect the amine functionality during further reactions and to facilitate controlled downstream modifications, such as electrophilic substitutions on aromatic amines.",
    "explanation": "The removal of HCl by pyridine prevents the reverse reaction and ensures high yield of the acylated product. Moreover, converting an amine to an amide modulates its reactivity, making it useful for selective reactions in multi-step synthetic pathways.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Aliphatic amines are generally stronger bases than ammonia due to the +I (electron donating) effect of alkyl groups, which increases electron density on nitrogen, enhancing its ability to accept a proton. Additionally, when an aliphatic amine reacts with a proton, the resulting ammonium ion benefits from the dispersal of the positive charge by the alkyl groups. However, in aqueous solution, solvation plays a significant role. The smaller, less hindered primary ammonium ions are better solvated by water through hydrogen bonding than the bulkier secondary or tertiary ions. This solvation stabilizes the cation, making the protonation process more favorable. Therefore, while basicity in the gas phase often follows the order tertiary > secondary > primary due to the inductive effect, in aqueous solution the order is reversed (primary > secondary > tertiary) because of solvation effects.",
    "explanation": "This answer integrates both electronic (inductive effects) and physical (solvation) factors. The inductive effect increases the availability of the lone pair for protonation, while solvation stabilizes the ammonium ion. The net observed basicity is a balance between these factors and explains the different trends observed in various phases.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Acetylation of aniline converts the –NH₂ group into an –NHCOCH₃ group. This transformation occurs when aniline is treated with acetic anhydride (often in the presence of pyridine) to form acetanilide. In acetanilide, the lone pair on the nitrogen is partially delocalized towards the carbonyl group, reducing its electron-donating ability to the aromatic ring. As a result, the ring becomes less activated toward electrophilic attack and the directing influence of –NH₂, which is originally strongly ortho/para directing, is moderated. This modification prevents multiple substitutions during electrophilic reactions such as nitration, allowing for the selective formation of mono-substituted products, particularly the para derivative. After nitration, the acetyl protecting group can be removed by hydrolysis to yield the desired nitroaniline.",
    "explanation": "The acetylation step is crucial to temper the high reactivity of aniline. By protecting the amino group, the reaction avoids uncontrolled substitutions and oxidation. This strategy employs the concept of protecting groups in organic synthesis, ensuring selective reaction at desired positions on the aromatic ring.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The basicity of alkylamines in aqueous solution results from a balance between several factors. The inductive (+I) effect of alkyl groups increases electron density on the nitrogen, making the amine more basic. However, when an amine is protonated, the resulting ammonium ion’s stability also depends on solvation. Primary ammonium ions have more available hydrogen atoms to participate in hydrogen bonding with water, leading to better solvation and stabilization, whereas steric hindrance in secondary and tertiary ammonium ions reduces the extent of solvation. This means that although in the gas phase, basicity might increase with more alkyl substitution (tertiary > secondary > primary), in aqueous solution the enhanced solvation of the primary ammonium ion outweighs the inductive donation provided by additional alkyl groups. Thus, for methyl-substituted and ethyl-substituted amines, the order in water tends to be: (CH₃)₂NH > CH₃NH₂ > (CH₃)₃N > NH₃ and (C₂H₅)₂NH > (C₂H₅)₃N > C₂H₅NH₂ > NH₃, reflecting the subtle interplay of these factors.",
    "explanation": "This explanation considers both electronic and physical interactions. While the electron-donating inductive effect increases basicity, the extent of solvation by water is crucial in aqueous environments. Steric hindrance reduces solvation efficiency, causing a reversal in the basicity trend compared to the gas phase.",
