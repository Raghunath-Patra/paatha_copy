    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Diazonium salts act as intermediates that allow the introduction of various substituents exceptions to the usual reactivity patterns of benzene. For example, while aryl halides such as fluorides and iodides cannot be introduced directly, they can be achieved through diazotization followed by substitution reactions. Similarly, the cyano group, which is difficult to incorporate via nucleophilic substitution on chlorobenzene, can be readily introduced by converting the diazonium salt.",
    "explanation": "The key advantage of diazonium salts is their ability to undergo a variety of substitution reactions. In the presence of appropriate nucleophiles (such as H3PO2 for deamination or CN⁻ for cyanation), the diazo group is replaced with the desired substituent. Reaction conditions typically require low temperatures for diazotization, followed by treatment with specific reagents under controlled conditions. Examples include the conversion of 4-nitrotoluene to 2-bromobenzoic acid, where the diazonium intermediate is formed and subsequently deaminated to yield the aryl bromide before oxidation.",

    "correct_answer": "The conversion involves first converting the aromatic amine to a diazonium salt through diazotization using NaNO₂/HCl at 273-278 K. Following this, the diazonium group is replaced by the cyano group via a substitution reaction, typically with a cyanide source. The overall process enables the introduction of the –CN group which is not readily introduced directly.",
    "explanation": "Initially, the aromatic amine is treated with NaNO₂ and HCl at low temperature (273-278 K) to form the diazonium salt. This intermediate is unstable and under controlled conditions can be reacted with a cyanide ion source (such as CuCN or KCN) to substitute the diazo group with a –CN group. This two-step process effectively bypasses the limitations of direct nucleophilic substitution on chlorobenzene and allows for the synthesis of cyanobenzene.",
