    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reactions of diazonium salts are divided into two categories. In reactions involving displacement of nitrogen, the diazonium group acts as a good leaving group and is substituted by nucleophiles such as halides (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻), cyanide, hydroxyl, or even hydrogen, with the liberated nitrogen being released as a gas. Examples include the Sandmeyer reaction (replacement by Cl⁻, Br⁻, CN⁻), the reaction with KI to form iodobenzene, and reductions by hypophosphorous acid or ethanol. In contrast, reactions retaining the diazo group involve coupling reactions where the diazonium ion reacts with aromatic compounds like phenol or aniline to form azo dyes, thereby retaining the –N=N– linkage in the product. This category relies on electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanisms, resulting in colored compounds used in dye industries.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Arenediazonium salts react with halide ions through two main processes. The Sandmeyer reaction uses Cu(I) salts along with the suitable halogen acid to introduce Cl⁻, Br⁻, or CN⁻ into the aromatic ring, generally resulting in higher yields and more controlled reaction conditions. In contrast, the Gattermann reaction employs copper powder with the halogen acid, which, although achieved under similar conditions, typically gives lower yields due to less efficient activation of the diazonium compound. The reaction conditions such as temperature and the nature of the copper species influence the rate and yield of the substitution reaction. Iodide ion introduction is distinct in that direct introduction is difficult, so potassium iodide is used separately without the need for copper catalysts.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Diazonium coupling reactions are pivotal in the synthesis of azo dyes, which are extensively used in the textile and printing industries. In these reactions, benzenediazonium chloride couples with phenol in a basic medium (pH 9-10) to produce p-hydroxyazobenzene, which is generally orange, while its coupling with aniline in an acidic medium (pH 4-5) leads to the formation of p-aminoazobenzene, a yellow dye. The pH of the medium greatly influences the reactivity of the aromatic coupling partner, with the ionization state of phenol and aniline affecting the position and rate of electrophilic substitution. As a result, careful control of reaction conditions ensures the formation of dyes with desired color intensities and stabilities.",
