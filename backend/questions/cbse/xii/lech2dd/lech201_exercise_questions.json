(iii) Grignard reagents react readily with water; even trace moisture will quench them, hence preparations must be anhydrous.",
    "explanation": "The dipole moment differences arise from resonance and molecular geometry. The immiscibility is due to the inability of alkyl halides to disrupt water’s hydrogen-bond network, and the extreme reactivity of Grignard reagents toward protic substances necessitates dry conditions.",
