Alternatively, methylation and hydroxylation steps can be arranged in different orders to yield different cresol isomers.",
    "explanation": "Various synthetic routes exist for preparing cresols. One common method is to o-methylate or p-methylate phenol derivatives. Alternatively, one may start with benzene and introduce a methyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation followed by the introduction of a hydroxyl group via oxidation or other substitution reactions.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The methyl group is an electron-donating group by induction. In cresols, its effect on acidity depends on its position. For example, in p-cresol, the methyl group may slightly reduce the acidity by increasing electron density on the ring, but the effect is less sterically hindered than in o-cresol, where intramolecular hydrogen bonding can also play a role.",
    "explanation": "The methyl group donates electrons through the inductive effect which tends to decrease the acidity of the phenolic hydroxyl. In o-cresol, despite this donation, intramolecular hydrogen bonding may stabilize the anion, sometimes offsetting the donation effect. In p-cresol, the absence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding leads to a more pronounced reduction in acidity. m-Cresol shows an intermediate behavior. Thus, the position of the methyl group critically affects the balance between these effects.",

    "explanation": "Cresols, due to their phenolic nature, are highly reactive and can undergo further substitution or oxidation reactions. This makes them useful in manufacturing resins, adhesives, and as antiseptic agents. However, industrial applications must consider their environmental impact, toxicity, and handling safety.
