    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "3,5-Dimethylhexane-1,3,5-triol has three hydroxyl groups which can lead to extensive hydrogen bonding and higher polarity, potentially increasing its solubility in water. Its multiple hydroxyl groups may also lower its volatility. In contrast, 4-Chloro-3-ethylbutan-1-ol has one hydroxyl group along with a chlorine substituent and an ethyl group. The chlorine introduces electron-withdrawing effects, possibly altering reactivity and polarity. The presence of a single OH group leads to reduced hydrogen bonding compared to the triol. Overall, the triol is expected to be more polar and have different physical properties such as boiling point and solubility compared to the monoalcohol with a halogen substituent.",
    "explanation": "The differences in functional groups (multiple –OH groups vs. one –OH with a halogen and alkyl substituents) affect intermolecular forces, reactivity, and properties like boiling point, solubility, and melting point.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For Cyclohexylmethanol, the name indicates a methanol group (–CH2OH) with a cyclohexyl substituent attached to the methylene carbon. The naming involves identifying the longest carbon chain containing the hydroxyl group and then specifying the cyclic substituent. In 3-Cyclohexylpentan-3-ol, the parent chain is pentane with a hydroxyl group at carbon 3, and the cyclohexyl substituent is also attached at carbon 3. The process involves determining the longest continuous chain, numbering it to give the lowest locant to the functional group (OH), and then naming and placing the substituents accordingly. This comparison illustrates the importance of chain selection and the priority of functional groups in IUPAC nomenclature.",
    "explanation": "IUPAC naming requires stepwise analysis: (1) Identify the longest chain containing the highest priority group (OH), (2) Number the chain to give that group the lowest possible number, (3) Identify and name substituents, and (4) Assemble the name with appropriate locants. Both examples follow these rules, with differences arising from the points of attachment of the cyclohexyl group and the position of the OH group.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One potential synthetic route involves first protecting the hydroxyl group of phenol using a suitable protecting group such as a silyl or benzyl ether. Then, perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride and an appropriate Lewis acid such as AlCl3 to introduce an ethyl group. Sequential or controlled dialkylation could be performed to attach the second ethyl group at the desired position (taking advantage of the directing effects of the protecting group and the substituent already introduced). Finally, remove the protecting group to regenerate the free phenol. The choice of protecting group and reaction conditions must be carefully optimized to favor substitution at the 2 and 3 positions.",
    "explanation": "Phenol is highly activated toward electrophilic aromatic substitution. However, selective diethylation requires careful control. Protecting the OH group moderates its activating effect and can help guide the electrophilic substitution to the ortho and meta positions. Friedel-Crafts alkylation, when used with proper conditions and protecting groups, allows for the introduction of alkyl groups at the required positions. This route illustrates the application of electrophilic aromatic substitution and protecting group strategies in organic synthesis.",
