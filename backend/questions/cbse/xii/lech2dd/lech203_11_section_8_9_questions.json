Proton transfer occurs within this intermediate, converting the –OH group into a better leaving group (water), which is then eliminated. Finally, a deprotonation step yields the ester product.",

    "correct_answer": "Trifluoroacetic acid has a pKa of approximately 0.23, while acetic acid has a pKa of about 4.76. The presence of three strongly electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms in trifluoroacetic acid stabilizes its conjugate base much more effectively than the methyl group in acetic acid, making trifluoroacetic acid a much stronger acid.",
    "explanation": "The strong inductive effect of the fluorine atoms in trifluoroacetic acid pulls electron density away from the carboxylate ion, stabilizing its negative charge.

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Carboxylate ions benefit from resonance stabilization by having two equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge is equally delocalized over two oxygen atoms. In contrast, phenoxide ions have resonance structures where the negative charge is delocalized over one oxygen and the aromatic ring; however, the delocalization onto carbon atoms (which are less electronegative than oxygen) is less effective. This greater stabilization of the carboxylate ion makes the parent carboxylic acid a stronger acid compared to phenols.",
    "explanation": "The effectiveness of resonance stabilization depends on the electronegativity of the atoms bearing the charge. In the carboxylate ion, both oxygen atoms efficiently share the negative charge, lowering the energy of the system and making deprotonation favorable. Phenoxide ions, despite resonance, cannot delocalize the charge as effectively because part of it resides on the less electronegative carbon atoms in the aromatic ring.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism starts with the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxylic acid on the electrophilic sulfur of SOCl₂, leading to the formation of an intermediate. This is followed by the elimination of chloride ion, which then attacks the carboxyl carbon. Proton transfers occur that ultimately replace the –OH group with –Cl, yielding the acid chloride. The side products, SO₂ and HCl, are gases that rapidly leave the reaction mixture, thus shifting the equilibrium toward the product side and driving the reaction to completion.",
    "explanation": "Thionyl chloride reacts with the carboxylic acid in a multi-step mechanism that involves activation of the carbonyl group and nucleophilic substitution. The formation and escape of gaseous SO₂ and HCl reduce the concentration of by-products, making the conversion more efficient by Le Chatelier's principle.",
