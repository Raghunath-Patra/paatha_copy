    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The DNA double helix is composed of two strands that wind around each other to form a helical structure. Each strand is made up of a sugar-phosphate backbone and nucleotide bases. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases: adenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine. This specific base pairing not only stabilizes the helical structure through hydrogen bonding but also ensures accurate replication during cell division as each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.",
    "explanation": "The double helix structure, discovered by Watson and Crick, showcases a stable structure due to the alternating sugar and phosphate groups forming the backbone while hydrogen bonds between A-T and C-G pairs maintain the integrity of the molecule.

DNA not only contains the instructions for the synthesis of all proteins but also replicates itself during cell division to provide identical copies to daughter cells. RNA plays a critical role in protein synthesis: m-RNA conveys the genetic message from DNA to the ribosomes, where r-RNA is involved in the assembly and catalysis of peptide bonds, while t-RNA transports amino acids to be added to the growing protein chain.",
