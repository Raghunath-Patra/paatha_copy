    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reaction mechanism involves an addition-elimination pathway. Initially, the OH⁻ ion, provided by molten NaOH, attacks the electron-deficient aromatic ring of chlorobenzene, leading to the formation of a Meisenheimer complex (anionic intermediate). The intermediate then eliminates the chlorine ion, forming sodium phenoxide. High temperature is essential because it provides the necessary energy to overcome the significant activation energy barrier due to the deactivated benzene ring. Finally, acidification protonates the phenoxide ion, yielding phenol.",
    "explanation": "Chlorobenzene is resistant to nucleophilic attack due to the deactivating effect of the chlorine substituent. High temperature molten NaOH creates conditions where the OH⁻ ion can add to the ring, forming a transient Meisenheimer complex. The elimination of Cl⁻ from this complex yields sodium phenoxide, which, upon acidification, becomes phenol. This detailed mechanism highlights the importance of temperature and the reaction intermediate.",

    "correct_answer": "The use of chlorobenzene and molten NaOH to produce phenol, known as the Dow process, offers certain advantages, including a simplified reaction sequence and utilization of readily available raw materials. However, the need for high temperatures and the associated energy costs, as well as the formation of byproducts like NaCl and potential corrosion issues, are significant drawbacks. Additionally, the harsh reaction conditions require specialized equipment, and the process may result in lower selectivity compared to other routes such as the cumene process.",
    "explanation": "The Dow process is attractive due to its direct conversion route, but the requirement for molten NaOH at high temperature increases operational costs and material degradation risks. Evaluating these factors helps in understanding the trade-offs between industrial efficiency and economic feasibility, making it necessary to consider both technical and economic aspects in process selection.",
