    "explanation": "Benzyl chloride, due to the benzylic position, can stabilize a carbocation. In polar protic solvents, the SN1 pathway is feasible; in polar aprotic conditions with a strong nucleophile such as OH⁻, an SN2 reaction predominates.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism starts with the protonation of the double bond in propene by the acid catalyst, leading to the formation of a secondary carbocation intermediate. Water then acts as a nucleophile and attacks this carbocation. Subsequent deprotonation of the resulting oxonium ion yields propan-2-ol. The regiochemistry is governed by the Markovnikov rule, where the proton adds to the less substituted carbon, stabilizing the more substituted carbocation. The acid catalyst is regenerated in the process, and no rearrangement is needed as the carbocation formed is already optimal.",
    "explanation": "In acid-catalyzed hydration, the double bond is protonated to form the more stable secondary carbocation. Water attacks this electrophilic center to form an intermediate that, upon deprotonation, gives propan-2-ol. The overall process adheres to the Markovnikov rule and emphasizes the role of the acid in both initiating the reaction and being regenerated at the end.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For ethyl magnesium chloride, the reaction is carried out by its addition to ethylene oxide, where the nucleophilic attack opens the strained epoxide ring, followed by acid workup to yield propan-1-ol. In contrast, methyl magnesium bromide reacts with acetone, a ketone with a carbonyl group, to form a tertiary alkoxide that upon protonation forms 2-methylpropan-2-ol. The choice of electrophile determines the type of alcohol produced: ethylene oxide yields a primary alcohol while acetone yields a tertiary alcohol. Steric hindrance in acetone favors the formation of a more substituted, stable tertiary center.",
    "explanation": "The key differences arise from the nature of the electrophiles. Ethylene oxide, a three-membered ring, is highly reactive and leads to a primary alcohol when attacked by the Grignard reagent. Acetone, being a ketone, forms a more hindered tertiary alcohol upon addition. The reaction conditions must be anhydrous to preserve the reactivity of the Grignard reagents, and the steric environment plays a significant role in determining product structure and stability.",
