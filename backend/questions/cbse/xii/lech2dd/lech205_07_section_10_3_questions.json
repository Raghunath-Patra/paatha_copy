    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower energy barrier. For example, in the case of sucrase-catalyzed hydrolysis of sucrose, the enzyme reduces the activation energy from 6.22 kJ/mol (in acid hydrolysis) to 2.15 kJ/mol. This reduction accelerates the reaction rate, allowing the reaction to proceed efficiently under the mild conditions present in living cells.",
    "explanation": "The enzyme works by binding to the substrate (sucrose) and stabilizing the transition state, making it easier for the reaction to occur. The lower activation energy implies that a greater proportion of molecules have sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier, thereby speeding up the reaction rate significantly. This is a fundamental principle of enzyme catalysis.",

    "correct_answer": "Enzymes exhibit high specificity due to their unique three-dimensional structures that form active sites complementary to specific substrates. This specificity ensures that enzymes catalyze only particular reactions, thereby reducing unwanted side reactions and increasing efficiency. For example, maltase specifically targets maltose to yield glucose and oxidoreductases catalyze specific redox reactions. Such specificity allows precise metabolic regulation and minimizes interference with other cellular processes.",
    "explanation": "The structure and function of enzymes are closely related; the selective binding to specific substrates facilitates controlled biochemical pathways, maintaining homeostasis in the organism.
