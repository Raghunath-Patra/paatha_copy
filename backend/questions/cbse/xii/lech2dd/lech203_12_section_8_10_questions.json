    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Higher fatty acids have long hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains and a hydrophilic carboxyl group which allow them to react with bases in a saponification process to form soaps and detergents. Their amphiphilic nature helps emulsify oils and greases, making them essential in cleaning products.",
    "explanation": "Higher fatty acids, due to their long hydrocarbon chains, exhibit nonpolar behavior combined with a polar carboxyl group. When reacted with a base, a saponification reaction occurs leading to the formation of a salt (soap). The resulting soap molecules have a hydrophilic end that interacts with water and a hydrophobic end that interacts with oils, thereby emulsifying and removing grease.",

    "correct_answer": "Methanoic acid is used in industries such as rubber, textile, dyeing, leather, and electroplating because of its strong reactivity and small molecular size, whereas ethanoic acid is used as a solvent and vinegar in the food industry due to its mild acidity and characteristic flavor. The differences in their chemical properties, such as lower molecular size and higher reactivity for methanoic acid versus the milder nature of ethanoic acid, make each suitable for their respective applications.",
    "explanation": "Methanoic acid's small size and reactivity make it efficient in processes requiring quick reactions or where a strong acid is needed. In contrast, ethanoic acid’s milder properties are ideal for applications in food, where both safety and flavor are important. This comparison highlights how the intrinsic chemical properties of these acids dictate their suitability for different industrial processes.",
