    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To synthesize 2-Methoxy-2-methylpropane, potassium tert-butoxide is first prepared by reacting tert-butanol with a strong base. This produces the tert-butoxide ion, which, due to its steric bulk, cannot attack a bulky electrophile. Instead, it is reacted with a small methyl iodide through an SN2 mechanism. In the rate-determining step, the methyl iodide is attacked by the oxygen atom of the tert-butoxide ion, leading to the displacement of iodide and formation of the ether linkage. The reaction proceeds via a concerted backside attack, characteristic of SN2 reactions.",
    "explanation": "The mechanism involves two steps: first, the generation of the alkoxide ion, which requires deprotonating an alcohol with a base; second, the SN2 attack on an electrophilic primary alkyl halide (methyl iodide in this case), which is possible even when using a bulky nucleophile because the electrophile is very small. This combination allows for efficient synthesis of the ether.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both reactions utilize the Williamson synthesis mechanism, but there are key differences. In the synthesis of 1-Methoxyethane, sodium methoxide reacts with a primary alkyl halide (such as ethyl bromide) via an SN2 reaction, which is straightforward. In contrast, the synthesis of Ethoxybenzene involves the generation of the phenoxide ion from phenol and a base, followed by reaction with an alkyl halide (typically ethyl iodide) via SN2. However, aromatic substrates require careful control of reaction conditions because aryl halides do not generally undergo SN2 reactions. Thus, for ethoxybenzene, phenol itself is deprotonated to form a reactive phenoxide ion, which then reacts with the alkyl halide. The use of a good leaving group (iodide) and appropriate solvents helps drive the reaction.",
    "explanation": "The comparison highlights that while both reactions rely on the formation of an alkoxide (or phenoxide) ion and subsequent SN2 reaction, the aromatic system in ethoxybenzene introduces additional steric and electronic considerations. For aromatic substrates, ensuring full deprotonation and using reactive alkyl halides are crucial for a successful reaction.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An effective procedure begins with the preparation of sodium propoxide by reacting propanol with sodium metal or sodium hydride under anhydrous conditions. In a dry solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, the alkoxide is then slowly added to a solution of 1-propyl bromide maintained at a low temperature to minimize elimination side reactions. The reaction mixture is stirred under inert atmosphere. After completion, the mixture is quenched, and the product is extracted using an organic solvent like diethyl ether. The crude product is purified by distillation to isolate pure 1-Propoxypropane.",
    "explanation": "This procedure emphasizes the importance of anhydrous conditions and low temperatures to favor SN2 substitution over elimination. The choice of solvent and inert atmosphere minimizes moisture, which could deactivate the alkoxide. Purification by distillation ensures removal of unreacted starting materials and byproducts.",
