    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The common nomenclature system typically uses straightforward names such as n-propyl bromide or isopropyl chloride based on the alkyl group and halide. In contrast, the IUPAC system names compounds as halosubstituted hydrocarbons, using numbers to denote the position of substituents. For example, CH₃CH₂CH₂Br is called n-propyl bromide in the common system but 1-bromopropane in the IUPAC system, and CH₃CH(Cl)CH₂CH₃ is called isobutyl chloride commonly while its IUPAC name is 1-chloro-2-methylpropane.",
    "explanation": "The IUPAC system provides a more systematic approach by numbering the carbon chain so that the substituents receive the lowest possible numbers, ensuring consistency and clarity.

Provide detailed reasoning based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The position of the bromine atom relative to the carbon skeleton determines whether a bromide is primary, secondary, or tertiary. In CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂Br (1-bromopentane), the bromine is attached to a primary carbon because it is at the end of the chain. If the bromine is attached to a carbon that is connected to two other carbons, such as in 2-bromopentane or 3-bromopentane, it is classified as a secondary bromide. When the bromine is attached to a carbon that is connected to three other carbon atoms, as in 2-bromo-2-methylbutane, the compound is classified as a tertiary bromide. Branching (such as methyl substituents) influences both the numbering and the classification: more substituents on the carbon bearing the bromine increase the degree of substitution. The IUPAC nomenclature rules require assigning the lowest possible number to the substituent and then naming the compound according to its structure, which inherently classifies the carbon as primary, secondary, or tertiary.",
    "explanation": "Using systematic numbering and identifying the carbon(s) bonded directly to the halogen, one can determine the substitution level. This approach is crucial in understanding the reactivity and stability of the compounds, as tertiary halides tend to be more sterically hindered compared to primary halides.",
