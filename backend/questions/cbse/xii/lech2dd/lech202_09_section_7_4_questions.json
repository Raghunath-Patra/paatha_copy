    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reaction begins with syn addition of BH3 to the alkene, where boron attaches to the less substituted carbon. This forms an organoborane intermediate that, upon oxidation with H2O2 in the presence of OH⁻, is converted into an alcohol. The replacement of the boron group with a hydroxyl group occurs without rearrangement, resulting in anti-Markovnikov addition.",
    "explanation": "In hydroboration-oxidation, the initial addition of BH3 is concerted and both the hydrogen and boron add to the same face of the alkene. The boron preferentially adds to the carbon with more hydrogen atoms (less substituted), and subsequent oxidation replaces the boron with an OH group, yielding the anti-Markovnikov product.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Phenol is significantly more acidic than ethanol because, upon deprotonation, the negative charge on the oxygen in phenol is delocalized into the aromatic ring, stabilizing the phenoxide ion. In contrast, ethanol forms an alkoxide ion with a localized negative charge, making it less stable and less acidic.",
    "explanation": "The resonance stabilization available in phenol distributes the negative charge over the benzene ring, lowering its energy and increasing acidity. Ethanol lacks this stabilization, resulting in a higher pKa and weaker acidity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Alcohols exhibit higher boiling points than similar hydrocarbons due to hydrogen bonding between the –OH groups. As the number of carbon atoms in the chain increases, van der Waals forces become more significant, raising the boiling point. Conversely, branching reduces the effective surface area for intermolecular interactions, thereby lowering the boiling point. For example, straight-chain pentan-1-ol has a higher boiling point than its branched isomers.",
    "explanation": "The hydroxyl group of alcohols forms strong hydrogen bonds, significantly affecting their boiling points. Longer chains increase dispersion forces, while branching disrupts these interactions by lowering the contact area between molecules. This explains the observed trend where methanol < ethanol < propan-1-ol, and a branched alcohol like butan-2-ol has a lower boiling point than its straight-chain isomer butan-1-ol.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Primary alcohols are oxidized first to aldehydes and can then be further oxidized to carboxylic acids, while secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones. Reagents like PCC are used to stop oxidation at the aldehyde stage, whereas stronger oxidizers like KMnO4 or CrO3 lead to further oxidation. Tertiary alcohols lack a hydrogen atom on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, so they cannot form the necessary carbonyl intermediate without breaking a C–C bond, which makes them resistant to oxidation under mild conditions.",
    "explanation": "The oxidation of alcohols involves the removal of hydrogen atoms: primary alcohols lose two hydrogens (one from the –OH and one from the adjacent carbon) to form an aldehyde, while secondary alcohols form a ketone. Tertiary alcohols do not possess the required hydrogen on the carbon with the –OH group, hence they do not oxidize easily without extensive cleavage of the carbon skeleton.",
