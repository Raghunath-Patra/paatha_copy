    "explanation": "The Grignard reagent (R-Mg-X) provides a nucleophilic carbon that adds to the carbon dioxide (O=C=O) to form the carboxylate salt.

From aldehydes: RCHO →(mild oxidizing agent)→ RCOOH. The primary alcohol undergoes oxidation in a single step using stronger oxidants, while aldehydes can be oxidized under milder conditions to avoid over-oxidation or side reactions.",
    "explanation": "The oxidation of primary alcohols to acids typically requires strong oxidizing agents which convert the -CH₂OH group directly to -COOH. Aldehydes, having a carbonyl group already, need only mild oxidation to form the acid.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Alkylbenzenes are oxidized by vigorous oxidizing agents like chromic acid or alkaline potassium permanganate (KMnO₄/KOH). The entire alkyl side chain attached to the benzene ring is oxidized to a carboxyl group to yield benzoic acid, regardless of chain length. Factors affecting the reaction include the presence of a benzylic hydrogen and the degree of substitution on the side chain; tertiary alkyl groups do not undergo oxidation because they lack the necessary benzylic hydrogen. For example, toluene (methylbenzene) is oxidized to benzoic acid under these conditions.",
    "explanation": "The complete oxidation of the side chain is achieved due to the strong oxidizing conditions provided by agents like KMnO₄/KOH or chromic acid. The requirement of a benzylic hydrogen explains why only primary and secondary alkylbenzene substituents are oxidized. The conditions ensure that even if the side chain is long, it is completely converted to a single carboxyl group, as seen in reactions involving toluene and propylbenzene.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One synthetic route involves first oxidizing the methyl group in acetophenone. Acetophenone can be oxidized using alkaline KMnO₄ (in the presence of KOH and heat) to convert the methyl substituent on the aromatic ring to a carboxyl group. The reaction proceeds as follows: 4-Methylacetophenone →(KMnO₄/KOH, Δ, then H₃O⁺)→ Benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid. The use of KMnO₄/KOH ensures vigorous oxidation, and the subsequent acidification converts the intermediate carboxylate ions to the acid form.",
    "explanation": "This route is justified because the oxidation conditions (KMnO₄/KOH with heat) are strong enough to oxidize alkyl side chains attached to aromatic rings, even when a carbonyl group (as in acetophenone) is present. The reaction conditions are chosen to ensure full oxidation and formation of the desired terephthalic acid. Each step, from oxidation to acidification, is supported by established organic reaction mechanisms.",
