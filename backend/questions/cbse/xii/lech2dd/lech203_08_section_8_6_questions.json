    "correct_answer": "For carboxylic acids with a single COOH group, the IUPAC name is formed by replacing the '-e' in the alkane name with '-oic acid' and numbering begins at the carboxyl carbon. For molecules with multiple COOH groups, the base alkyl chain is numbered with the carboxyl carbon as position 1, additional COOH groups are indicated by their positions using Arabic numerals, and a multiplicative prefix (such as di-, tri-) is added before 'carboxylic acid' in the name.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the requirement for numbering and multiplicative prefixes when multiple carboxyl groups are present.

    "correct_answer": "The carboxyl group (COOH) is planar with bond angles of about 120Â° due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbon atom. Resonance delocalization occurs between the carbonyl oxygen and the hydroxyl oxygen, resulting in a distribution of electron density that stabilizes the overall structure while reducing the electrophilicity of the carbon. This resonance effect limits the reactivity of the carbonyl carbon compared to other more electrophilic carbonyl compounds.",
    "explanation": "By sharing the negative charge between both oxygen atoms, resonance minimizes the electron deficiency on the carbon atom.
