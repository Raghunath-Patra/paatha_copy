    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism begins with the hydroboration step, where 1-hexene reacts with BH3 (typically in THF) through a concerted syn addition, generating a trialkylborane intermediate. In this step, boron attaches to the less substituted carbon while hydrogen adds to the more substituted carbon, ensuring anti-Markovnikov orientation. The second step involves oxidation: the organoborane intermediate is treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of NaOH, converting the boron atom into a hydroxyl group to form 1-hexanol. This process avoids carbocation rearrangements and yields the alcohol with syn stereochemistry.",
    "explanation": "The detailed mechanism involves two distinct steps. First, during hydroboration, BH3 adds across the double bond of 1-hexene in a concerted, syn manner, leading to an alkylborane where the boron is attached at the less substituted carbon. Second, oxidation with H2O2/NaOH replaces the boron with an OH group, forming the corresponding alcohol. This method is notable for its selectivity and lack of rearrangement.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A synthetic route begins with treating the alkene with BH3 (in THF) to perform hydroboration, forming an alkylborane intermediate. This intermediate is then oxidized using H2O2 and NaOH to yield the anti-Markovnikov alcohol. The reaction proceeds via syn addition, meaning both the hydrogen and boron (later replaced by OH) add to the same face of the alkene, resulting in a specific stereochemical orientation. Compared to acid-catalyzed hydration which follows Markovnikov's rule and might involve carbocation rearrangements, hydroboration-oxidation offers a cleaner, more predictable pathway without rearrangement and uses milder conditions.",
    "explanation": "The route illustrates the use of BH3/THF for the hydroboration step and H2O2/NaOH for the oxidation step. The method ensures that the hydroxyl group attaches to the less substituted carbon (anti-Markovnikov) due to steric factors, and the syn addition mechanism preserves stereochemical information. This makes the reaction attractive over methods like acid-catalyzed hydration, which often lead to rearrangements and Markovnikov products.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the hydroboration step, steric factors play a critical role because BH3 preferentially approaches the less hindered side of the alkene, leading to addition at the less substituted carbon. Electronic factors such as the lower electron density at the less substituted carbon also facilitate the formation of the organoborane intermediate. For example, when 1-hexene undergoes hydroboration, the boron atom adds to the terminal carbon because it is less substituted, which directly influences the anti-Markovnikov outcome after oxidation.",
    "explanation": "The reaction's regioselectivity is governed by both steric hindrance and electronic distribution across the alkene. The less substituted carbon is more accessible and has a favorable orbital alignment, allowing BH3 to add in a concerted manner. This rationale explains why anti-Markovnikov alcohols are produced reliably without involving carbocation intermediates that are common in other addition reactions.",
