    "correct_answer": "One possible route is to start from isopentane and perform a selective oxidation or hydrofunctionalization reaction that introduces the OH group at the tertiary position. Once the reaction is complete, the product can be purified. Its structure can be confirmed using IR spectroscopy (to confirm the presence of the OH stretch), proton NMR (to analyze the environment of the hydrogens and confirm substitution at the tertiary carbon), and mass spectrometry (to verify the molecular weight of 88 g/mol). The tertiary nature of the alcohol is indicated by the chemical shifts and splitting patterns in the NMR spectrum, as the OH-bearing carbon in 2-methyl-2-butanol is attached to three other carbon atoms.",
