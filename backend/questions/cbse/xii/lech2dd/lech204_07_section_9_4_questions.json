    "correct_answer": "A large excess of ammonia minimizes further alkylation of the primary amine, thereby favoring its formation over secondary, tertiary, or quaternary products.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Gabriel synthesis involves converting phthalimide to its potassium salt with ethanolic KOH, followed by reaction with an alkyl halide to form N-alkylphthalimide. This intermediate is then subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to yield the primary amine and sodium phthalate. Aromatic amines cannot be obtained because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the phthalimide anion due to the stability and lack of reactivity of the aryl carbon-halogen bond.",
    "explanation": "The process starts with deprotonation of phthalimide to form its salt, which attacks the alkyl halide via an S_N2 mechanism forming N-alkylphthalimide. Subsequent base hydrolysis removes the phthalimide group, yielding the primary amine. The inability of aryl halides to participate in the S_N2 mechanism due to partial double bond character in the C–X bond explains why aromatic amines are not produced.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ammonolysis begins with the nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl halide by ammonia to form a primary ammonium salt which, under the reaction conditions, can lose a proton to form a free primary amine. This free amine can further react with another alkyl halide to form a secondary amine, and continued alkylations eventually form tertiary amine and finally a quaternary ammonium salt. To maximize primary amine yield, a large excess of ammonia is used which minimizes further alkylation of the formed primary amine.",
    "explanation": "The sequential S_N2 reactions involve initial formation of a substituted ammonium salt that can deprotonate. Each successive alkylation results in a higher substituted amine. By employing a large excess of ammonia, the probability of the free primary amine encountering additional alkyl halide is reduced, hence favoring the primary amine product.",
