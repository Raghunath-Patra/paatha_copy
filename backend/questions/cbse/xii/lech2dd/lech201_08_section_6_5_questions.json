    "correct_answer": "The electrophilic substitution method involves direct halogenation of an aromatic ring using halogens and a Lewis acid catalyst, which is straightforward and typically yields a mixture of isomers (ortho and para). The differences in physical properties like melting points allow for separation. In contrast, the Sandmeyer reaction converts an aromatic amine into a diazonium salt using NaNO₂ and cold aqueous acid, which is then substituted with a halogen via a copper(I) salt. The Sandmeyer reaction is more versatile regarding the type of halogen introduced and proceeds under milder conditions for sensitive groups, though it requires the preliminary transformation to a diazonium salt.",
    "explanation": "Both methods introduce halogens to the aromatic ring but differ significantly in mechanism and conditions.

However, its limitations include regioselectivity issues—often forming mixtures of ortho and para isomers—and its inapplicability for synthesizing fluoro compounds due to the excessive reactivity of fluorine. Additionally, reversible reactions (as seen in iodination) require oxidising agents for completion, complicating the process under certain conditions.",

    "explanation": "First, calculate moles of reactant: 20.0 g / 56.11 g/mol = 0.3566 mol. Theoretical yield: 0.3566 mol * 108.02 g/mol = 38.48 g. Actual yield is 22.5 g, so % yield = (22.5 g / 38.48 g) * 100 = 58.43%. However, recognizing that the product here is from anti-Markovnikov addition in a radical process, we need to check the calculation: Re-evaluating the process shows that the product formation should be one-to-one. If instead the moles of product are directly calculated from the given mass, 22.5 g / 108.02 g/mol = 0.2083 mol. Thus, if the theoretical moles that should form (assuming full conversion) is 0.2083 mol, the percentage yield is (0.2083/0.3566)*100 ≈ 58.4%. Given the original solution expected an 83.3% yield, rechecking the numbers using appropriate molar masses may be needed. However, using the provided numbers and conversion, the correct percentage yield calculated is approximately 58.4%.
