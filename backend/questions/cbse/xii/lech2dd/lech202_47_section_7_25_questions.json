    "correct_answer": "C) The involvement of a strong base and steric hindrance that favor elimination over substitution",

    "correct_answer": "The base in Williamson synthesis deprotonates the alcohol to form the alkoxide ion, which acts as the nucleophile. However, if the base is too strong or the substrate is sterically hindered, it may also abstract a proton from the alkyl halide, leading to competing elimination (E2) reactions.",
    "explanation": "The deprotonation step is crucial, but excessive basicity, especially in the presence of hindered substrates, can divert the reaction pathway from substitution to elimination, diminishing the yield of the desired ether.",

    "correct_answer": "An example is t-butyl methyl ether. The t-butyl group forms a tertiary center, which makes the corresponding halide very prone to elimination rather than substitution, thus rendering the Williamson synthesis ineffective.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Williamson synthesis is limited by factors such as steric hindrance, which leads to elimination side reactions especially with secondary and tertiary substrates, and by problematic nucleophilicity in cases such as phenoxides. Alternative strategies include the acid-catalyzed dehydration of alcohols and transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions (such as the Ullmann ether synthesis).",
    "explanation": "The Williamson synthesis relies on an SN2 mechanism, making it unsuitable for hindered substrates. Acid-catalyzed dehydration avoids the need for alkoxides but works best for symmetrical ethers derived from simple alcohols. Transition-metal catalysis offers a milder alternative, expanding the substrate scope to include hindered or complex structures, thus overcoming steric limitations while minimizing elimination side reactions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Steric hindrance in Williamson synthesis leads to lower yields and increased elimination reactions, especially with tertiary or secondary alkyl halides. In contrast, methods like acid-catalyzed dehydration of alcohols, though limited to symmetrical ethers, avoid the need for strong bases, thereby reducing elimination. However, dehydration reactions may have issues with rearrangements and require high temperatures. Both methods have pros and cons, making the selection dependent on the specific substrates and desired products.",
    "explanation": "This evaluation highlights that while the Williamson synthesis is versatile for primary substrates, its effectiveness decreases with increased steric bulk. The dehydration method provides an alternative for simple alcohols but lacks the generality to form unsymmetrical ethers. A careful consideration of substrate structure, reaction conditions, and potential side reactions is crucial when choosing the synthetic route.",
