    "correct_answer": "Hydrogen bonding is stronger due to the significant electronegativity difference between hydrogen and oxygen, creating a strong dipole-dipole attraction. This causes propanol molecules to adhere more strongly to one another, requiring more energy to break these interactions during boiling, unlike butane which only exhibits weaker dispersion forces.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Molecular structure plays a crucial role in determining boiling points. Propanol contains an -OH functional group, which allows for hydrogen bondingâ€”a strong intermolecular force that requires significant energy to overcome. This results in a higher boiling point. In contrast, butane is a nonpolar molecule without any functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding, relying solely on weak dispersion forces. This difference explains why propanol has a considerably higher boiling point than butane.",
    "explanation": "The boiling point of a substance depends largely on intermolecular forces. In propanol, the hydroxyl group not only introduces polarity but also enables hydrogen bonding, an interaction that is much stronger than the dispersion forces that predominate in butane. As molecular weight alone does not account for the dramatic difference, the presence and type of functional group (in this case, -OH) are key. This is a clear demonstration of how molecular structure influences physical properties. Experimental measurements of boiling points reflect these theoretical predictions and are invaluable in confirming the relationship between structure and physical behavior.",

    "correct_answer": "An experiment comparing the boiling points of propanol and butane should control for ambient pressure and purity of samples. Pros include the ability to directly observe the effect of hydrogen bonding in propanol versus the weak dispersion forces in butane. Cons include the volatility of butane and safety concerns due to its flammability, which may complicate measurements. Additionally, ensuring accurate thermal control is critical because slight variations can affect the observed boiling points. Overall, while the experiment can effectively demonstrate differences due to molecular interactions, practical challenges must be addressed.",
    "explanation": "When evaluating experimental design, considerations must include reproducibility, safety, and control of variables. The design must account for the flammable nature of butane and the need to precisely control temperature and pressure conditions. The experiment should also employ calibrated instruments to accurately measure boiling points. The key takeaway is that while hydrogen bonding in propanol results in a higher boiling point, designing an experiment to compare such properties requires careful handling of potential hazards and control over extraneous factors.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "As the carbon chain length increases, both alcohols and alkanes show higher boiling points due to increased dispersion forces. However, the alcohols continue to benefit from hydrogen bonding due to their -OH groups. Therefore, while both types of compounds will have increased boiling points with longer chains, the boiling point difference between the alcohol and its analogous alkane is likely to remain significant or even increase due to the continual contribution of hydrogen bonding in alcohols, whereas alkanes only gain relatively weaker dispersion interactions.",
    "explanation": "Longer carbon chains increase molecular surface area and polarizability, leading to stronger van der Waals forces. In alcohols, the additional chain length adds to the dispersion forces on top of the hydrogen bonding, while alkanes only benefit from the former. Consequently, the hydrogen bonding in alcohols provides an extra boost in boiling point that is not matched by alkanes, maintaining or widening the boiling point gap as chain length increases.",
