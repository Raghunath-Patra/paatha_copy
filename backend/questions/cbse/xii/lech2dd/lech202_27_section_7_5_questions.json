    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in the solubility of alcohols in water. The hydroxyl group in alcohols is polar, due to a significant electronegativity difference between oxygen and hydrogen. This polarity enables the formation of hydrogen bonds with water molecules. For instance, in methanol and ethanol, the OH group interacts with water, allowing these alcohols to mix uniformly. The hydrogen bonds help overcome the hydrophobic interactions of the non-polar parts of the alcohol molecules, thereby enhancing solubility.",
    "explanation": "The explanation involves understanding that hydrogen bonding occurs when a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen, interacts with another electronegative atom. This intermolecular attraction is strong enough to facilitate the dissolving process of alcohols in water.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The solubility of organic compounds in water is largely determined by their ability to engage in intermolecular interactions with water. Alcohols contain polar hydroxyl groups that form hydrogen bonds with water, making them more soluble. Their molecular structure typically consists of a hydrophilic OH group and a hydrophobic carbon chain, with solubility decreasing as the chain length increases. In contrast, hydrocarbons are non-polar and only engage in weak London dispersion forces, which are insufficient to disrupt water’s strong hydrogen bonding network. Thus, hydrocarbons tend to be insoluble in water. This comparison highlights the critical role of polarity and the type of intermolecular forces in determining solubility.",
