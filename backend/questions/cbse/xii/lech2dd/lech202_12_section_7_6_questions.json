The choice of reagent influences the reaction rate and mechanism; for example, HBr tends to react faster than HCl while SOCl₂ provides milder conditions with minimal rearrangement.",

However, since a yield over 100% is not possible, check if the actual product mass is mistakenly high. Assuming the reported values are correct, reevaluate: it is more likely that there was an error in the values. In a standard calculation: percentage yield = (8.35/9.0) x 100 ≈ 92.8%. Alternatively, if we assume the provided values lead to a theoretical yield less than actual, consider that the correct approach is using the formula: (actual/theoretical)x100. Using the provided numbers directly: (9.0/8.35)x100 ≈ 107.8% which indicates an experimental error. For the purpose of calculation, if we assume 9.0 g is theoretical, then actual yield would have been 8.35 g leading to a yield of (8.35/9.0)*100 ≈ 92.8%.
