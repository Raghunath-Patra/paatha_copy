    "correct_answer": "A balanced diet is crucial to provide the necessary vitamins required for proper bodily functions. For example, vitamin A, found in fish liver oil, carrots, butter, and milk, prevents night blindness and xerophthalmia. Vitamin B₁ present in milk, yeast, green vegetables, and cereals is essential to prevent beri beri. Similarly, vitamin C from citrus fruits and green leafy vegetables prevents scurvy, while vitamin D obtained from sunlight, fish, and egg yolk is important to prevent rickets and osteomalacia. These examples show that obtaining vitamins from diverse sources ensures that the body receives adequate nutrients to prevent deficiency diseases.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The statement suggests that humans depend largely on external sources for vitamins, as most cannot be synthesized endogenously. In contrast, plants have the biosynthetic capability to produce nearly all vitamins, emphasizing the importance of a plant-inclusive diet. Biochemically, this means that humans must obtain these essential compounds through diet or, in some cases, through bacterial synthesis in the gut. Nutritionally, this dependence necessitates a balanced diet to avoid deficiencies. Supplementation strategies must be carefully considered since both under-supply and over-supply can lead to health issues; for instance, fat-soluble vitamins can accumulate and cause toxicity, while water-soluble vitamins need regular intake due to their excretion. The statement underlines the need for dietary planning and medical guidance when using vitamin supplements.",
    "explanation": "This detailed answer considers the biochemical inability of the human body to synthesize most vitamins and compares it to the plant's ability. It discusses the nutritional implications and the need for a balanced diet, while also outlining the risks of excess supplementation.
