    "explanation": "Each compound is named by applying IUPAC rules for amines. Primary amines have –NH₂ attached to one carbon, secondary ones have one hydrogen replaced by an alkyl/aryl group on nitrogen, and tertiary amines have no N–H bonds.

    "correct_answer": "A common test is the Hinsberg reaction. In this test, primary amines (and to some extent benzylamines) react with benzenesulphonyl chloride to form sulphonamides that are soluble in alkali, while tertiary amines do not react. Also, the carbylamine reaction is positive only for primary amines. Thus, using a combination of the Hinsberg test and the carbylamine reaction one can distinguish between these pairs.",
    "explanation": "The Hinsberg test differentiates amines based on their reactivity with benzenesulphonyl chloride. Primary amines form sulphonamides soluble in alkali, secondary give derivatives insoluble in alkali, and tertiary amines do not react.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Answers include: (i) In aniline, the lone pair is delocalized into the aromatic ring and is less available for protonation, resulting in a higher pK₍b₎ than methylamine. (ii) Ethylamine readily forms hydrogen bonds with water due to its small hydrophobic part, whereas the larger aromatic ring in aniline reduces water solubility. (iii) Methylamine forms a complex with ferric chloride causing precipitation of hydrated ferric oxide. (iv) Under nitration conditions, protonation of the amino group occurs, forming anilinium ion which is meta-directing. (v) Aniline forms strong complexes with Lewis acids (e.g., AlCl₃), inhibiting Friedel-Crafts reactions. (vi) Aromatic diazonium salts benefit from resonance stabilization, making them more stable than aliphatic diazonium salts. (vii) Gabriel synthesis avoids over-alkylation and is effective for primary amines because aryl halides are unreactive toward the phthalimide anion.",
    "explanation": "Each part requires application of concepts such as resonance, hydrogen bonding, solvation, and reagent reactivity. The reduced basicity of aniline is due to lone pair delocalization, while solubility differences and reactivity with ferric chloride are related to structural effects. Electrophilic substitution behavior is explained by protonation and directing effects, and the stability of diazonium salts is a consequence of resonance. Finally, the limitations of alkylation are overcome by Gabriel synthesis.",

This trend is explained by the strength and number of possible intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

Alkanes, lacking any polar groups for hydrogen bonding, rely solely on weak dispersion forces.",
    "explanation": "By comparing the boiling points, it is clear that hydrogen bonding greatly influences boiling points. The higher boiling point for n-C4H9OH is due to strong hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group.

    "correct_answer": "Diazonium coupling reactions are pivotal in the synthesis of azo dyes, which are extensively used in the textile and printing industries. In these reactions, benzenediazonium chloride couples with phenol in a basic medium (pH 9-10) to produce p-hydroxyazobenzene, which is generally orange, while its coupling with aniline in an acidic medium (pH 4-5) leads to the formation of p-aminoazobenzene, a yellow dye. The pH of the medium greatly influences the reactivity of the aromatic coupling partner, with the ionization state of phenol and aniline affecting the position and rate of electrophilic substitution. As a result, careful control of reaction conditions ensures the formation of dyes with desired color intensities and stabilities.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

Primary ammonium ions, having more hydrogen atoms available, can form more hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thereby achieving greater stabilization.

This differential solvation influences the apparent basicity, often making primary amines stronger bases in water despite the inductive effects of alkyl groups.",

    "correct_answer": "Pyridine is used in the acylation reaction of amines because it acts as a base to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction, thereby driving the equilibrium toward the product side. This acylation reaction converts an amine (-NH₂) into an amide (-NHCO-), which is less reactive. This transformation is valuable in synthesis as it serves both to protect the amine functionality during further reactions and to facilitate controlled downstream modifications, such as electrophilic substitutions on aromatic amines.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Aliphatic amines are generally stronger bases than ammonia due to the +I (electron donating) effect of alkyl groups, which increases electron density on nitrogen, enhancing its ability to accept a proton. Additionally, when an aliphatic amine reacts with a proton, the resulting ammonium ion benefits from the dispersal of the positive charge by the alkyl groups. However, in aqueous solution, solvation plays a significant role. The smaller, less hindered primary ammonium ions are better solvated by water through hydrogen bonding than the bulkier secondary or tertiary ions. This solvation stabilizes the cation, making the protonation process more favorable. Therefore, while basicity in the gas phase often follows the order tertiary > secondary > primary due to the inductive effect, in aqueous solution the order is reversed (primary > secondary > tertiary) because of solvation effects.",
    "explanation": "This answer integrates both electronic (inductive effects) and physical (solvation) factors. The inductive effect increases the availability of the lone pair for protonation, while solvation stabilizes the ammonium ion.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Acetylation of aniline converts the –NH₂ group into an –NHCOCH₃ group. This transformation occurs when aniline is treated with acetic anhydride (often in the presence of pyridine) to form acetanilide. In acetanilide, the lone pair on the nitrogen is partially delocalized towards the carbonyl group, reducing its electron-donating ability to the aromatic ring. As a result, the ring becomes less activated toward electrophilic attack and the directing influence of –NH₂, which is originally strongly ortho/para directing, is moderated. This modification prevents multiple substitutions during electrophilic reactions such as nitration, allowing for the selective formation of mono-substituted products, particularly the para derivative. After nitration, the acetyl protecting group can be removed by hydrolysis to yield the desired nitroaniline.",
    "explanation": "The acetylation step is crucial to temper the high reactivity of aniline. By protecting the amino group, the reaction avoids uncontrolled substitutions and oxidation.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The basicity of alkylamines in aqueous solution results from a balance between several factors. The inductive (+I) effect of alkyl groups increases electron density on the nitrogen, making the amine more basic. However, when an amine is protonated, the resulting ammonium ion’s stability also depends on solvation. Primary ammonium ions have more available hydrogen atoms to participate in hydrogen bonding with water, leading to better solvation and stabilization, whereas steric hindrance in secondary and tertiary ammonium ions reduces the extent of solvation. This means that although in the gas phase, basicity might increase with more alkyl substitution (tertiary > secondary > primary), in aqueous solution the enhanced solvation of the primary ammonium ion outweighs the inductive donation provided by additional alkyl groups. Thus, for methyl-substituted and ethyl-substituted amines, the order in water tends to be: (CH₃)₂NH > CH₃NH₂ > (CH₃)₃N > NH₃ and (C₂H₅)₂NH > (C₂H₅)₃N > C₂H₅NH₂ > NH₃, reflecting the subtle interplay of these factors.",
    "explanation": "This explanation considers both electronic and physical interactions. While the electron-donating inductive effect increases basicity, the extent of solvation by water is crucial in aqueous environments. Steric hindrance reduces solvation efficiency, causing a reversal in the basicity trend compared to the gas phase.",

    "explanation": "The mechanism involves multiple steps. Initially, sodium nitrite reacts with HCl to produce nitrous acid, which under acidic conditions, forms the electrophilic nitrosonium ion (NO⁺).

    "explanation": "The key advantage of diazonium salts is their ability to undergo a variety of substitution reactions. In the presence of appropriate nucleophiles (such as H3PO2 for deamination or CN⁻ for cyanation), the diazo group is replaced with the desired substituent. Reaction conditions typically require low temperatures for diazotization, followed by treatment with specific reagents under controlled conditions.

Aromatic amines cannot be obtained because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the phthalimide anion due to the stability and lack of reactivity of the aryl carbon-halogen bond.",
    "explanation": "The process starts with deprotonation of phthalimide to form its salt, which attacks the alkyl halide via an S_N2 mechanism forming N-alkylphthalimide. Subsequent base hydrolysis removes the phthalimide group, yielding the primary amine.

    "correct_answer": "Ammonolysis begins with the nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl halide by ammonia to form a primary ammonium salt which, under the reaction conditions, can lose a proton to form a free primary amine. This free amine can further react with another alkyl halide to form a secondary amine, and continued alkylations eventually form tertiary amine and finally a quaternary ammonium salt. To maximize primary amine yield, a large excess of ammonia is used which minimizes further alkylation of the formed primary amine.",
    "explanation": "The sequential S_N2 reactions involve initial formation of a substituted ammonium salt that can deprotonate. Each successive alkylation results in a higher substituted amine.
