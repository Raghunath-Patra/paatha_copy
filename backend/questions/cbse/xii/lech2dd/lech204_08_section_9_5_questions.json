    "correct_answer": "The data in Table 9.2 show that n-C4H9OH has the highest boiling point, followed by n-C4H9NH2, then (C2H5)2NH, and finally the alkane, iso-pentane. This trend is explained by the strength and number of possible intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Alcohols, with oxygen, form stronger hydrogen bonds than amines, and within amines, primary types can form more hydrogen bonds than secondary or tertiary types. Alkanes, lacking any polar groups for hydrogen bonding, rely solely on weak dispersion forces.",
    "explanation": "By comparing the boiling points, it is clear that hydrogen bonding greatly influences boiling points. The higher boiling point for n-C4H9OH is due to strong hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group.

Primary amines, with two N—H bonds, exhibit the highest boiling points due to stronger and more extensive hydrogen bonding.

Steps include: measuring equal volumes of water, adding fixed amounts of each compound separately, stirring and equilibrating, and then visually observing the extent of mixing or using spectrophotometric methods to determine concentration in the aqueous phase. Controls should include water alone and a known soluble compound. Based on molecular structure, it is expected that butan-1-ol will show higher solubility due to stronger hydrogen bonding from the hydroxyl group compared to the amine group in butan-1-amine.",
    "explanation": "The experiment must systematically compare the solubility by controlling concentration, temperature, and stirring time.
