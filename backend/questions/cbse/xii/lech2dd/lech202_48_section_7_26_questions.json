    "explanation": "Primary alkyl halides do not stabilize carbocations well, making the SN1 mechanism unfavorable.

    "correct_answer": "The choice of a strong, non-nucleophilic base (such as NaH) is critical for efficient deprotonation of propan-1-ol to form the alkoxide ion without side-reactions. The solvent should be aprotic (like dimethyl sulfoxide) to favor the SN2 mechanism by stabilizing ions without interfering with the nucleophilic attack. These conditions minimize competing elimination reactions and improve the overall yield and selectivity of the ether synthesis.",
    "explanation": "A strong base ensures complete deprotonation of the alcohol, while an aprotic solvent aids in the SN2 reaction by not solvating the nucleophile too strongly, which would reduce its reactivity. In contrast, protic solvents might hydrogen bond with the nucleophile, decreasing its effectiveness. Thus, these reaction conditions play an essential role in the success of the Williamson Ether Synthesis.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism begins with the deprotonation of propan-1-ol by a strong base such as NaH to form the propoxide ion. Next, the propoxide ion attacks the primary alkyl halide in an SN2 reaction, resulting in the displacement of the halide and formation of 1‑propoxypropane. Potential side reactions include elimination reactions if the alkyl halide is sensitive, or competing reaction of the base with the alkyl halide, though these are minimized under controlled conditions using proper solvents.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines each mechanistic step: initial alkoxide formation followed by a concerted SN2 nucleophilic attack.

    "correct_answer": "The Williamson Ether Synthesis offers a high degree of control over the formation of unsymmetrical ethers, typically yielding high purity products when using a primary alkyl halide and a strong base to form the alkoxide. However, limitations include the necessity for a strong base, which can lead to side reactions and issues with sterically hindered substrates. In contrast, acid-catalyzed methods may not control regioselectivity as well and often result in symmetric ethers, but they sometimes are more straightforward for simple systems.",
    "explanation": "This response highlights that while the Williamson Ether Synthesis is highly effective for producing unsymmetrical ethers like 1‑propoxypropane by using an alkoxide and primary alkyl halide via SN2, it does require strict conditions to avoid side reactions.
