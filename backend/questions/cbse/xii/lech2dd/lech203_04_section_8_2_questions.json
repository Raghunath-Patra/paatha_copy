    "correct_answer": "Oxidation of primary alcohols leads to the formation of aldehydes and that of secondary alcohols leads to ketones, typically using oxidizing agents like PCC or CrO3. In dehydrogenation, alcohol vapors are passed over heavy metal catalysts (Ag or Cu), and the reaction involves removal of hydrogen. Primary alcohols dehydrogenate to yield aldehydes and secondary to ketones.",
    "explanation": "Oxidation involves the addition of an oxygen atom (or removal of hydrogen) through chemical reagents and is typically carried out in a solution phase, while dehydrogenation is a gas-phase catalytic process used industrially for volatile alcohols.

    "explanation": "The use of chromyl chloride converts the methyl group into an intermediate chromium complex that is resistant to further oxidation.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Aldehydes can be prepared from acyl chlorides via the Rosenmund reduction, which uses H2 over Pd/BaSO4 to reduce the acyl chloride selectively to an aldehyde. In contrast, aldehydes can also be synthesized from nitriles and esters using reducing agents like DIBAL-H or stannous chloride (in the Stephen reaction). The mechanism for the Rosenmund reduction involves hydrogenolysis of the acyl chloride, while the reduction of nitriles involves the formation of an imine intermediate that is subsequently hydrolyzed. The acyl chloride method is generally straightforward and selective but limited to available acyl chlorides. The nitrile/ester method allows for broader substrate scope but requires careful control of reaction conditions to avoid over-reduction.",
    "explanation": "The Rosenmund reduction is advantageous for its selectivity and simplicity, whereas nitrile and ester reductions offer versatility. However, the control of reduction and prevention of over-reduction are critical challenges in the latter methods. This comparison highlights how substrate nature and reagent choice influence reaction outcomes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The dehydrogenation of alcohols is an industrial process where volatile alcohol vapors are passed over heavy metal catalysts such as silver or copper. This process removes hydrogen from the alcohol, converting primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones. The advantages include continuous operation and avoidance of stoichiometric oxidizing agents, making it more economical on a large scale. However, limitations include high temperature requirements, catalyst deactivation over time, and the need for specialized equipment to handle alcohol vapors.",
    "explanation": "Heavy metal catalysts facilitate the removal of hydrogen in a controlled manner. The process is attractive industrially due to its efficiency and lower waste compared to chemical oxidation methods.
