    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A complete answer should define each derivative: For example, a cyanohydrin is a compound having the –C(OH)(CN) group formed by the addition of HCN to a carbonyl compound; an acetal is formed when an aldehyde reacts with two equivalents of an alcohol (usually under acid catalysis) forming R–CH(OR')2; a semicarbazone is formed by the reaction of a carbonyl compound with semicarbazide (H2N–NH–CO–NH2); an aldol is the β-hydroxy aldehyde or ketone obtained in an aldol reaction; a hemiacetal is the intermediate resulting from addition of one equivalent of alcohol to an aldehyde; an oxime is produced when hydroxylamine (NH2OH) reacts with a carbonyl group; a ketal is the acetal derivative of a ketone; an imine (Schiff's base) is formed by the condensation of a primary amine with an aldehyde yielding >C=N–R; and a 2,4-DNP derivative is the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone formed by reaction of a carbonyl compound with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.",
    "explanation": "Each term describes a type of derivative of aldehydes or ketones. Their formation involves characteristic nucleophilic addition (and sometimes subsequent elimination) reactions. For instance, the formation of a cyanohydrin involves nucleophilic attack by cyanide (CN–) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, while acetals are formed under acidic conditions by sequential addition of alcohols and loss of water.",

(ii) Although semicarbazide contains two –NH₂ groups, usually only the terminal –NH₂ (the one less involved in resonance with the adjacent carbonyl) is nucleophilic enough to condense with the carbonyl group. (iii) Removing water (or the ester) shifts the equilibrium toward ester formation by Le Chatelier’s principle, thereby driving the reaction to completion.",
    "explanation": "Steric hindrance impacts nucleophilic addition reactions. The electronic environment in semicarbazide makes one –NH₂ more reactive than the other. In esterification reactions, continuous removal of water avoids the reverse hydrolysis reaction, thus favoring ester formation.",

    "question_text": "An organic compound contains 69.77% carbon, 11.63% hydrogen and the rest oxygen. The molecular mass of the compound is 86. It does not reduce Tollens' reagent but forms an addition compound with sodium hydrogensulphite and gives a positive iodoform test. On vigorous oxidation it gives ethanoic and propanoic acid. Write the possible structure of the compound.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Based on the data, the compound is likely a methyl ketone with an additional methylene group between the carbonyl and an aromatic or unsaturated moiety. A plausible structure is CH₃CH₂COCH₃ (i.e., 2-butanone) but adjusting for the molecular formula C₉H₁₀O suggests an aromatic methyl ketone. Considering the oxidation products (ethanoic and propanoic acid), a possible structure is one in which a propyl group and a methyl group flank the carbonyl, such as 1-phenyl-1-propanone. However, since the oxidation gives two different acids, a structure like CH₃COCH₂CH₂Ph (where Ph is phenyl) is more likely.",
    "explanation": "The positive iodoform test indicates the presence of a CH₃CO– group. Lack of Tollens’ reactivity suggests a ketone rather than an aldehyde. The oxidation yielding two different acids indicates cleavage of a side-chain at the carbonyl. Balancing the elemental composition with a molecular mass of 86 guides the structure determination.",

    "question_text": "Although phenoxide ion has more number of resonating structures than carboxylate ion, carboxylic acid is a stronger acid than phenol. Why?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Carboxylate ions are more stabilized because the negative charge is equally delocalized over two oxygen atoms, which are more electronegative, whereas in phenoxide ions the charge is delocalized onto carbon atoms of the aromatic ring which are less electronegative.",
    "explanation": "The extent and effectiveness of resonance stabilization, as well as the electronegativity of the atoms over which the negative charge is delocalized, determine acid strength. In carboxylate ions, the equal distribution of the negative charge over two oxygens makes them significantly more stable than phenoxide ions.",
