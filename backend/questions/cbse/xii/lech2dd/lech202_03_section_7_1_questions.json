    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Monohydric alcohols are classified based on the hybridization of the carbon atom to which the –OH group is attached and the nature of the carbon (primary, secondary, tertiary). In primary alcohols, the –OH group is bonded to a carbon attached to only one other carbon. In secondary alcohols, the –OH group is bonded to a carbon attached to two other carbons, and in tertiary alcohols, the –OH group is attached to a carbon bonded to three other carbons. This classification influences the reactivity and steric hindrance around the hydroxyl group, with tertiary alcohols generally being more sterically hindered and less reactive in certain reactions compared to primary and secondary alcohols.",
