    "question_text": "Which of the following best explains why ortho and para nitrophenols are more acidic than phenol?",
    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": [
      "The nitro group donates electrons to the benzene ring increasing electron density.",
      "The nitro group withdraws electrons by resonance, stabilizing the negative charge on the phenoxide ion.",
      "Steric hindrance from the nitro group forces deprotonation.",
      "The nitro group increases the pKa of the compound."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "The nitro group withdraws electrons by resonance, stabilizing the negative charge on the phenoxide ion.",
    "explanation": "The nitro group is a strong electron withdrawing group. Its ability to pull electron density by resonance stabilizes the phenoxide ion when the proton is lost, thereby increasing the acidity of nitrophenols.",
    "topic": "Resonance structures of nitrophenoxide ions",
