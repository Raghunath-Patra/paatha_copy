    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism followed by a haloalkane largely depends on steric and electronic factors. Primary and methyl halides with minimal steric hindrance favor the SN2 mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks directly in a one-step process. In contrast, tertiary halides, which are sterically hindered, favor the SN1 mechanism because they can form a stable carbocation intermediate under polar protic conditions. Reaction conditions such as solvent type, temperature, and the strength/size of the nucleophile or base also play critical roles in determining the pathway.",
    "explanation": "Understanding the differences in substrate structure, especially steric hindrance and carbocation stability, is key. SN2 requires less hindered substrates, while SN1 benefits from conditions that stabilize a carbocation. Additionally, polar protic solvents support carbocation formation, favoring the SN1 pathway.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Grignard reagents are formed when a haloalkane reacts with magnesium metal in dry ether. The reaction involves the insertion of magnesium into the carbon-halogen bond, generating an organomagnesium halide (R–Mg–X). Dry ether is essential because Grignard reagents are highly reactive toward water and other proton donors, which would otherwise protonate the reagent to form the corresponding hydrocarbon, thus destroying the organometallic species.",
    "explanation": "The carbon-magnesium bond in Grignard reagents is polar, making the carbon nucleophilic.

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Nucleophilic substitution reactions result in the replacement of a leaving group by a nucleophile, proceeding via either a bimolecular (SN2) or unimolecular (SN1) mechanism, whereas elimination reactions involve the removal of a proton (usually β-hydrogen) along with the leaving group to form a double bond. The choice between substitution and elimination depends on factors such as the structure of the haloalkane (primary, secondary, tertiary), the strength, bulkiness and nature of the nucleophile/base, as well as reaction conditions like temperature and solvent. Strong, bulky bases and higher temperatures tend to favor elimination, while smaller, strong nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents favor substitution.",
    "explanation": "Both reaction pathways compete under many conditions; thus, understanding the role of steric effects, base/nucleophile strength, and solvent choices helps predict the major product. The Zaitsev rule further aids in predicting the predominant alkene in elimination reactions.",
