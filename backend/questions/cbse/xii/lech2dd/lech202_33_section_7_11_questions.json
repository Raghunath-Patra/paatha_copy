Finally, the protonated ethanol undergoes deprotonation to yield neutral ethanol and regenerate the acid catalyst.",

    "correct_answer": "Both the hydration of ethene and other electrophilic addition reactions begin with the protonation (or attack by an electrophile) of the alkene, forming a carbocation intermediate. However, while in the hydration of ethene water attacks the carbocation to form ethanol, in other additions different nucleophiles (such as halides in halogenation reactions) attack the carbocation or form a cyclic intermediate. The key difference lies in the identity of the nucleophile and the possibility of different stereochemical outcomes.",
    "explanation": "In electrophilic addition reactions, the initial step is similar, involving the addition of an electrophile to break the double bond and generate a carbocation. The subsequent nucleophilic attack varies with the reagent present: water in hydration, halide ions in halogenation, or other nucleophiles in various addition reactions. This leads to differences in the final products and reaction conditions.",
