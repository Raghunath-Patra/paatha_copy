    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Alkyl halides are classified based on the number of alkyl groups attached to the carbon bearing the halogen. Primary (1°) alkyl halides have the halogen bonded to a carbon attached to only one other carbon, secondary (2°) alkyl halides are bonded to a carbon connected to two other carbons, and tertiary (3°) alkyl halides have the halogen on a carbon bonded to three other carbons. This degree of substitution affects chemical reactivity; for example, tertiary halides typically undergo elimination reactions more readily due to steric hindrance and the stability of the resulting carbocation, whereas primary halides are more likely to undergo substitution reactions.",
    "explanation": "The classification into primary, secondary, and tertiary is significant because it influences both the reactivity and the mechanism of reaction. Tertiary alkyl halides form more stable carbocations, favoring unimolecular reactions, while primary alkyl halides are less hindered and favor bimolecular substitution pathways.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Compounds with sp³ C—X bonds include alkyl halides, allylic halides, and benzylic halides. In alkyl halides the halogen is bonded to an sp³ carbon of an alkyl group; in allylic halides, the halogen is attached to a sp³ carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond; in benzylic halides, it is bonded to a sp³ carbon directly attached to an aromatic ring. On the other hand, compounds with sp² C—X bonds include vinylic and aryl halides. Vinylic halides have the halogen bonded directly to a sp² carbon of a carbon–carbon double bond, while aryl halides have the halogen attached directly to an aromatic ring's sp² carbon. These differences in hybridisation not only affect molecular geometry but also influence chemical reactivity, with sp²-hybridised C—X bonds generally being stronger and less reactive compared to sp³ C—X bonds.",
    "explanation": "This answer compares the structural effects of sp³ versus sp² hybridisation on the carbon–halogen bond. It highlights that allylic and benzylic halides benefit from resonance stabilization, whereas the more rigid structures of vinylic and aryl halides lead to different reactivity patterns, such as resistance to nucleophilic substitution in many cases.",
