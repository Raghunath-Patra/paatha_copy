    "explanation": "The Williamson synthesis generally involves converting one alcohol to its alkoxide ion via deprotonation with a strong base.

This SN2 process proceeds through a single transition state with inversion of configuration at the carbon center, leading to the formation of the ether bond.",
    "explanation": "The SN2 mechanism is characterized by a concerted reaction pathway where the nucleophile makes a backside attack on the electrophilic carbon, causing the leaving group to depart and forming the new ether linkage. Inversion of stereochemistry is a hallmark of such reactions.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The design of the synthesis involves selecting the appropriate alcohol to convert to the alkoxide (often the less hindered one) and the complementary alkyl halide derivative for the SN2 attack. For 2-ethoxy-3-methylpentane, one might generate the ethoxide ion from ethanol and use a derivative (e.g., a halide) of 3-methylpentan-2-ol. A strong base such as sodium hydride is used for deprotonation. Limitations include possible elimination reactions if the electrophile is too hindered or if secondary substrates are used, and side reactions like competing SN1 processes if conditions are not optimal. The reaction conditions (solvent, temperature) must favor the SN2 pathway, minimizing steric hindrance and elimination.",
    "explanation": "A detailed discussion should consider the reactivity trends of alcohols and alkyl halides in Williamson synthesis, the importance of a strong base for effective deprotonation, and the need to select conditions that favor SN2 over SN1 or elimination pathways. Potential side reactions can reduce yield and complicate purification.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Step 1: Deprotonation - A strong base such as sodium hydride is used to deprotonate one of the alcohols (typically the less sterically hindered one) forming the alkoxide ion. Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack - The alkoxide ion undergoes an SN2 reaction with an appropriate alkyl halide (derived from the other alcohol after conversion into a good leaving group) to form 2-ethoxy-3-methylpentane. This route avoids the acid-catalyzed conditions that might lead to undesired side reactions like rearrangements or eliminations. It is preferred due to its mild reaction conditions, predictability and higher selectivity for ether formation.",
    "explanation": "The mechanism explains the formation of the alkoxide ion and its subsequent SN2 attack on an electrophilic center. Advantages of this method include its efficiency, selectivity and ability to avoid harsh reaction conditions that might lead to rearrangements, which are possible in acid-catalyzed ether syntheses.",
