    "correct_answer": "The four levels of protein structure are: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. The primary structure refers to the specific sequence of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. The secondary structure includes regular patterns like the α-helix, where the –NH group of each amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the –C=O group of another turn, and the β-pleated sheet, where extended chains form hydrogen bonds in a sheet-like arrangement. The tertiary structure represents the overall three-dimensional folding of a single polypeptide chain, stabilized by hydrogen bonds, disulphide bonds, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions. The quaternary structure is seen in proteins composed of two or more polypeptide chains (subunits) arranged in a specific spatial manner.",
    "explanation": "Each level of protein structure builds upon the previous one, with the primary sequence dictating secondary patterns, which then fold into a unique tertiary shape, and finally, in some proteins, multiple chains assemble into a quaternary structure. The interactions at each level ensure specificity and functionality of the protein.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the formation of a peptide bond, the carboxyl group (–COOH) of one amino acid reacts with the amino group (–NH₂) of another amino acid, resulting in the elimination of a water molecule (condensation reaction) and formation of an amide bond (–CO–NH–). For example, when glycine (H₂N–CH₂–COOH) reacts with alanine (H₂N–CH(CH₃)–COOH), a water molecule is removed and glycylalanine is formed. This dehydration synthesis links the amino acids into a dipeptide. The removal of water is significant because it drives the reaction forward, enabling the formation and stabilization of the peptide bond.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The primary structure, which is the unique sequence of amino acids, determines the way the protein folds into its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. Even a minor change in the primary structure can lead to significant variations in the overall 3D conformation and, consequently, the function of the protein. This is because the chemical properties of the side chains influence local interactions such as hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions, which in turn dictate larger-scale folding and stabilization. Therefore, the primary structure is crucial as it encodes all the information necessary to form the functional three-dimensional structure of the protein.",
    "explanation": "This concept underscores the central dogma of protein chemistry where the sequence of amino acids is directly linked to biological activity. Alterations in primary structure can lead to loss or change of function, which is evident in many diseases caused by protein misfolding.",
