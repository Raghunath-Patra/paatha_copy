    "correct_answer": "When numbering from the end containing the hydroxyl group, CH2OH becomes C1, the double bond is between C2 and C3, bromine is at C2, and the methyl substituent is at C3. Thus, the locants are OH at 1, Br at 2, and CH3 at 3.",
    "explanation": "The hydroxyl group has the highest priority, so numbering starts at the CH2OH end. This gives the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, bromine attached to carbon 2 and the methyl group on carbon 3, resulting in the locants 1, 2, and 3 respectively.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Challenges include determining the priority order of functional groups, selecting the proper parent chain that accommodates the highest priority group, and minimizing the locant numbers for all substituents and functional groups. For example, in compound (v), CH3–C(CH3)=C(Br)–CH2OH, determining whether to number from the CH2OH end or from the double bond end is crucial. Since the hydroxyl group has a higher priority than the double bond, numbering must start at CH2OH to give it the lowest possible number, even if that means a higher number for the double bond.",
    "explanation": "When multiple functional groups are present, the IUPAC rules require a clear hierarchy of functional group priority, which affects the numbering. The choice of the parent chain and the assignment of locants can become complicated, as seen in compounds that contain both an alcohol and a double bond or halogen substituent. The example of compound (v) clearly illustrates the need to balance these factors by prioritizing OH over other groups.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Naming open-chain compounds, such as 3-(hydroxymethyl)-4,5-dimethylhexane, involves selecting the longest carbon chain and then identifying and numbering all substituents and multiple bonds. In contrast, cyclic compounds like 3-bromocyclohexanol use the ring as the parent structure, and substituents are numbered around the ring in a way that gives the highest priority substituent (often the functional group) the lowest possible number. The main difference lies in the structural framework – linear versus ring – which influences both the numbering and the naming conventions.",
    "explanation": "For open-chain compounds, the main challenge is in selecting the longest continuous route and assigning numbers to minimize locants for substituents. For cyclic compounds, the ring itself is the parent, and numbering is done around the ring. In 3-bromocyclohexanol, the hydroxyl group takes priority in the ring, establishing the base numbering and positioning the bromine accordingly. This comparison illustrates the differing strategies that must be adopted depending on whether the compound is acyclic or cyclic.",
