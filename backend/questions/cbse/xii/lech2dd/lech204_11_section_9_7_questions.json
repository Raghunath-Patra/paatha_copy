    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reaction mechanism starts with the formation of nitrous acid in situ by the reaction of sodium nitrite with hydrochloric acid. Nitrous acid then protonates to form the nitrosonium ion, which is an electrophile. The nitrosonium ion reacts with the electron-rich amino group of aniline to form an intermediate, which then loses a proton to yield the diazonium ion. The overall stoichiometry is: C₆H₅NH₂ + NaNO₂ + 2HCl → C₆H₅N₂⁺Cl⁻ + NaCl + 2H₂O.",
    "explanation": "The mechanism involves multiple steps. Initially, sodium nitrite reacts with HCl to produce nitrous acid, which under acidic conditions, forms the electrophilic nitrosonium ion (NO⁺). Aniline, with its nucleophilic amino group, attacks NO⁺ to form an N-nitrosoamine intermediate, which rearranges and loses water to form the diazonium ion. The stoichiometry reflects the necessary balancing of all reactants and by-products.",
