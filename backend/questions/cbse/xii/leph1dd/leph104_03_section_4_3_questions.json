    "explanation": "The derivation begins by recognizing that for a particle moving in a circle, the required centripetal force is m·v²/r. Since the magnetic force, given by q·v·B when the motion is perpendicular to B, acts as this centripetal force, setting m·v²/r equal to q·v·B and solving for r yields r = m·v/(q·B).

    "correct_answer": "The angular frequency (ω) of a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by ω = q·B/m, which is independent of the particle's speed. Since the rotational frequency ν is ω/2π, it also does not depend on the speed. This independence is exploited in cyclotron design because a constant frequency of the accelerating electric field can be used to accelerate particles over a range of energies. It simplifies synchronization between the particle motion and the accelerating field, ensuring efficient energy gain at each pass through the accelerating region.",
    "explanation": "Because the magnetic force only changes the direction of the velocity and not its magnitude, the formula for angular frequency derived from equating the magnetic force to the centripetal force shows no dependency on v. As a result, even as particles gain energy and their speeds increase, their frequency remains constant.
