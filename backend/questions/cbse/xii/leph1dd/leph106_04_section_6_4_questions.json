    "correct_answer": "When a magnetic flux through a coil changes with time, an emf is induced in each turn of the coil. For a coil with N turns, each experiencing the same change in flux, the total induced emf is given by emf = -N (dΦ/dt). The negative sign indicates the direction of the induced emf is such that its magnetic field opposes the change in the original flux (Lenz's law). This is derived from Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.",
    "explanation": "Faraday's law states that a time rate of change in magnetic flux causes an induced emf equal to -dΦ/dt for a single loop. In a coil with N closely-wound turns, since each loop experiences the same change in flux, the induced emf is amplified by the number of loops. Therefore, the emf becomes emf = -N (dΦ/dt).

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Experiment 6.3, pressing the tapping key causes the current in coil C2 to rise rapidly from zero to a maximum, which in turn creates a rapidly increasing magnetic field. This results in an increase in the magnetic flux through the nearby coil C1, inducing an emf and a resulting current. When the key is held pressed, the current remains constant, so the flux is constant and the induced current drops to zero. Upon releasing the key, the current in coil C2 falls rapidly to zero, causing a rapid decrease in the magnetic flux and again inducing an emf in coil C1, which produces a current.",
    "explanation": "The process hinges on the fact that emf is induced only when there is a change in flux. A rapid change (either increase or decrease) in current in coil C2 causes a corresponding change in the magnetic field and flux through coil C1. Constant current does not change the flux, and therefore no emf is induced during that phase. This clearly demonstrates how transient changes in a circuit can induce measurable currents in nearby circuits.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Faraday's law is fundamental in designing devices like generators and transformers. For example, in generators, mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy by rotating coils in a magnetic field, creating a changing flux that induces an emf. In transformers, a changing flux in the primary coil induces a proportionally scaled emf in the secondary coil, depending on the ratio of turns. The advantages include efficient energy conversion and the ability to step up or step down voltage levels. Limitations include energy losses due to resistance and eddy currents, as well as the fact that the induced emf depends on time-varying conditions, which may require precise control.",
    "explanation": "Faraday's law underpins the operation of many electromagnetic devices. In generators, the law explains how motion in a magnetic field creates electricity, while in transformers, it provides the basis for voltage adjustments by altering coil turns. However, practical challenges such as resistive losses, heat generation, and non-ideal magnetic coupling impose limits on efficiency and performance.",
