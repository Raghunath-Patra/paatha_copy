    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The cancellation of the perpendicular magnetic field components occurs due to the symmetry of the circular loop. For every infinitesimal element that produces a field component perpendicular to the axis, there is an opposing element whose perpendicular component is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. This symmetry ensures that when these contributions are integrated over the complete loop, the net perpendicular field is zero. Consequently, only the axial component survives, simplifying the calculation to focus solely on the contributions along the axis.",
    "explanation": "The answer highlights the importance of symmetry in the problem. Because the loop is circular and uniformly carries current, every pair of diametrically opposite elements yields perpendicular components that cancel out. This principle is central to why the net magnetic field is purely axial, and it reflects the underlying uniformity in the system.",

    "correct_answer": "A complete circular loop produces a magnetic field at its center given by B = μ₀I/(2R), where all current elements contribute symmetrically. In contrast, a semicircular arc contributes half the magnitude of the current loop, as only half the circumference is present, even though the direction of the field (determined by the right-hand rule) remains the same. Additionally, any straight segments attached to the semicircular arc contribute no magnetic field at the center because the current element and the displacement vector are parallel.",
    "explanation": "The answer compares both configurations by explaining that while the curved part of the semicircular arc contributes similarly to a full circle, its net effect is halved due to the missing half, and any straight segments do not contribute as their contribution cancels out. This analysis relies on understanding both the Biot-Savart law and the symmetry present in the full loop scenario.",
