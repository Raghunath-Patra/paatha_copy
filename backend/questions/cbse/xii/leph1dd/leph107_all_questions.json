    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A capacitor can improve the power factor by providing a leading reactive current that cancels out a portion of the lagging reactive current from an inductive load. In a phasor diagram, the total current is resolved into a component in phase with the voltage (which does real work) and a perpendicular reactive component (which does not consume power). By adding a capacitor, the reactive component is reduced, moving the overall current vector closer to the voltage vector. This results in a smaller phase angle φ and an increased cos φ, thereby improving the power factor.",
    "explanation": "In circuits with inductive loads, the current lags behind the voltage, manifesting as a reactive component (Iq) perpendicular to the applied voltage. Connecting a capacitor generates an equal and opposite reactive current (Ic) that subtracts from Iq. The resultant current thus has a larger portion (Ip) that is in phase with the voltage. The phasor diagram demonstrates this cancellation, where the overall current vector tilts toward the voltage vector, reducing φ and enhancing the power factor (cos φ).",

This detunes the circuit from its resonant frequency, causing a significant change in current. The change in current is detected by the electronic circuitry, which then triggers an alarm.",
    "explanation": "Metal detectors exploit the sensitivity of LC circuits at resonance. At resonance, the impedance is minimized and the current is maximized. When metal is introduced into the coil, its magnetic properties alter the inductance, shifting the resonance condition. This shift leads to a measurable change in the circuit’s current.

The transient part arises from the energy initially stored in the inductor or capacitor and decays with time constants determined by the circuit parameters (e.g., R, L, and C).

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "In an AC circuit with only resistors, voltage and current are in phase, meaning their peaks and zero crossings occur simultaneously. However, in circuits with reactive components like capacitors or inductors, the current and voltage have a phase difference; capacitors cause the current to lead the voltage, while inductors cause the current to lag behind the voltage. This phase difference affects the power factor and overall efficiency of the circuit.",
    "explanation": "This analysis highlights that in resistor-only circuits, there is no phase shift, simplifying analysis.

    "explanation": "Given the rms current (I = 0.5 A) and knowing that Vₘ = 311 V is the peak voltage, first compute the peak current from the rms value: iₘ = I × √2 = 0.5 A × 1.414 ≈ 0.707 A. Then using Ohm's law for peak values, R = Vₘ / iₘ = 311 V / 0.707 A ≈ 440 ohms. However, verifying using rms values, V = I × R implies R = V / I = 120 V / 0.5 A. To resolve this discrepancy, note that the given 311 V is the peak voltage and the rms voltage would be 311 V / √2 ≈ 220 V. Thus, using rms values, R = 220 V / 0.5 A = 440 ohms. This demonstrates consistency because using peak values and converting between rms and peak yields the same resistance value.",

This flux links with the secondary coil, where it induces an electromotive force (emf) according to Faraday's law of induction. In an ideal transformer, the back emf in the primary counters the applied voltage, and the voltage ratio between the secondary and primary is given by the turns ratio (Vₛ/Vₚ = Nₛ/Nₚ). Conservation of power (ignoring losses) implies that the current ratio is the inverse of the turns ratio (Iₛ/Iₚ = Nₚ/Nₛ), so stepping up the voltage results in stepping down the current, and vice versa.",

However, higher voltage levels require careful insulation and safety measures. Step-down transformers are used near the consumer end to reduce the voltage to safer, usable levels.

Overall, these transformers are integral in balancing efficiency, safety, and practicality in power distribution.",

    "explanation": "Capacitive reactance, Xc = 1/(ωC), restricts the current amplitude in a capacitor-based AC circuit similarly to how a resistor limits current in a resistive circuit.

    "correct_answer": "A phasor diagram for a capacitive AC circuit shows two rotating vectors: one for voltage and one for current. The voltage phasor lags behind the current phasor by 90°. This means that when the voltage vector is at a reference angle (for instance, 0°), the current vector is 90° ahead. This 90° phase difference corresponds to the sinusoidal nature of the voltage and current, where current = i_m cos(ωt) and voltage = V_m sin(ωt), reflecting a quarter-cycle difference in their peaks.",
    "explanation": "In a phasor diagram, each vector represents the instantaneous magnitude and phase of sinusoidally varying quantities. For a capacitor, because i = d(q)/dt leads to i = ωC V_m cos(ωt), the current vector rotates in such a way that its maximum occurs a quarter cycle (90°) before the maximum voltage.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Inserting an iron rod into the inductor increases the inductance of the coil due to the enhanced magnetic permeability. This increases the inductive reactance, which in turn means that a larger portion of the AC voltage drops over the inductor. As a result, less voltage is available to the light bulb, causing it to glow less brightly.",
    "explanation": "The magnetic field inside the coil is increased by the iron rod, thereby increasing the coil's inductance. Since inductive reactance is proportional to the inductance (X_L = ωL), an increase in L leads to an increase in X_L. With a higher reactance, the voltage drop across the inductor increases, leaving a reduced voltage across the light bulb and hence reduced brightness. This explanation is rooted in the fundamental principles of AC circuit analysis and the behavior of inductor reactance.",

    "correct_answer": "In a DC circuit, when a capacitor is connected, it initially allows a current to flow as it charges up until the voltage across it equals the source voltage, at which point the current stops. In an AC circuit, however, the capacitor continuously charges and discharges in synchrony with the alternating voltage. This results in a continuous, oscillatory current flow, although the net energy transfer over one complete cycle is zero because the capacitor does not dissipate energy.",
    "explanation": "Under DC conditions, the capacitor behaves as an open circuit once fully charged because the voltage difference prevents further current flow. However, with an AC source, the applied voltage alternates in polarity causing the capacitor to alternately charge and discharge during each cycle. The periodic charging and discharging lead to a phase difference between current and voltage (with the current leading by 90°). This continuous exchange of energy without net loss is why the average power over a cycle is zero, distinguishing the behavior of the capacitor in AC versus DC circuits.",
