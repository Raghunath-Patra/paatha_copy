    "correct_answer": "A phasor diagram for a capacitive AC circuit shows two rotating vectors: one for voltage and one for current. The voltage phasor lags behind the current phasor by 90°. This means that when the voltage vector is at a reference angle (for instance, 0°), the current vector is 90° ahead. This 90° phase difference corresponds to the sinusoidal nature of the voltage and current, where current = i_m cos(ωt) and voltage = V_m sin(ωt), reflecting a quarter-cycle difference in their peaks.",
    "explanation": "In a phasor diagram, each vector represents the instantaneous magnitude and phase of sinusoidally varying quantities. For a capacitor, because i = d(q)/dt leads to i = ωC V_m cos(ωt), the current vector rotates in such a way that its maximum occurs a quarter cycle (90°) before the maximum voltage. Drawing these vectors with an appropriate angular separation visually demonstrates that current leads voltage by 90°.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Inserting an iron rod into the inductor increases the inductance of the coil due to the enhanced magnetic permeability. This increases the inductive reactance, which in turn means that a larger portion of the AC voltage drops over the inductor. As a result, less voltage is available to the light bulb, causing it to glow less brightly.",
    "explanation": "The magnetic field inside the coil is increased by the iron rod, thereby increasing the coil's inductance. Since inductive reactance is proportional to the inductance (X_L = ωL), an increase in L leads to an increase in X_L. With a higher reactance, the voltage drop across the inductor increases, leaving a reduced voltage across the light bulb and hence reduced brightness. This explanation is rooted in the fundamental principles of AC circuit analysis and the behavior of inductor reactance.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a DC circuit, when a capacitor is connected, it initially allows a current to flow as it charges up until the voltage across it equals the source voltage, at which point the current stops. In an AC circuit, however, the capacitor continuously charges and discharges in synchrony with the alternating voltage. This results in a continuous, oscillatory current flow, although the net energy transfer over one complete cycle is zero because the capacitor does not dissipate energy.",
    "explanation": "Under DC conditions, the capacitor behaves as an open circuit once fully charged because the voltage difference prevents further current flow. However, with an AC source, the applied voltage alternates in polarity causing the capacitor to alternately charge and discharge during each cycle. The periodic charging and discharging lead to a phase difference between current and voltage (with the current leading by 90°). This continuous exchange of energy without net loss is why the average power over a cycle is zero, distinguishing the behavior of the capacitor in AC versus DC circuits.",
