    "correct_answer": "A dipole in a uniform electric field has two equal and opposite forces acting on the positive and negative charges. Although these forces cancel out when considering the net linear force, they produce a torque because they are separated by a distance. The torque is calculated as the product of one force and the perpendicular distance (the arm of the couple). The resulting expression, tau = p x E, shows that the torque depends only on the magnitude of the dipole moment, the electric field, and the sine of the angle between them. Since the forces are equal and opposite, the specific point of application (or the choice of origin) does not affect the magnitude or direction of the torque; it is solely determined by the intrinsic dipole geometry and field orientation.",
    "explanation": "The explanation hinges on recognizing that while the net force is zero due to the uniformity of the field, the couple formed by the two forces creates a turning effect. This is independent of the coordinate system because the forces’ directions and distances between their lines of action remain constant.

    "correct_answer": "In a uniform electric field, a dipole experiences a torque, given by p x E, which tends to align it with the field, but there is no net force because the equal and opposite forces on the two charges cancel. In contrast, in a non-uniform electric field, the unequal field strengths at the locations of the positive and negative charges result in a net force in addition to any torque. This net force can move the dipole toward regions of stronger or weaker field depending on its orientation. A practical example is a charged comb attracting neutral pieces of paper: the non-uniform electric field of the comb induces a dipole in the paper, and the resulting net force draws the paper toward the comb.",

By applying a known electric field and measuring the equilibrium angle where the electric torque balances a restoring mechanical torque (from a calibrated torsion spring or gravitational component), one can compute the dipole moment and verify the torque relation tau = pE sinθ. Recording the angular deviation as the field strength is varied can confirm the linear relationship between torque and field strength, and control experiments with known dipoles can calibrate the system.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Polarity of charge refers to the existence of two types of electric charge—positive and negative. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, electrons are transferred from the rod to the silk. This results in the glass rod having a deficiency of electrons (making it positive) and the silk having an excess (making it negative). The law of like charges repelling and opposites attracting explains the subsequent behavior of the charged objects.",
    "explanation": "The concept of polarity of charge is fundamental in understanding electrostatic phenomena. In the example given, friction causes electrons, which are loosely bound, to move from the glass rod to the silk cloth. With the loss of electrons, the glass rod becomes positively charged. Meanwhile, the silk gains electrons and becomes negatively charged. This difference, or polarity, is why the charged bodies exhibit attraction when brought near one another, and why like-charged objects repel each other. Various experiments, including the observation with gold‐leaf electroscope, further demonstrate these principles.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiments with different material pairs show that when objects are rubbed together, they acquire charges of opposite sign. For example, a glass rod rubbed with silk becomes positive while the silk becomes negative, and similarly for a plastic rod rubbed with cat's fur. When these objects are brought near each other, the attraction between opposite charges and repulsion between like charges is consistently observed. Using various materials helps confirm that the phenomenon is due to the inherent property of electrons and not an artifact of a single substance.",
    "explanation": "The experiments are designed so that by rubbing different pairs of materials, one can observe the transfer of electrons based on the different electron affinities of the materials involved. For instance, when a glass rod and silk interact, electrons move from the glass to the silk (or vice versa in other combinations), leading to a net positive charge on one and a net negative charge on the other. The consistent observation that like charges repel and unlike charges attract across several pairs of materials reinforces the generality of the electrical force. This approach also eliminates biases that could arise from using a single pair and helps in establishing the fundamental law of electrostatics.",

Additionally, while arrow length in some diagrams might also be scaled to indicate field strength, the primary indicator in field line diagrams is the number of lines per unit area, which decreases as 1/r^2 from a point charge.",
    "explanation": "The use of electric field lines was introduced for a qualitative understanding of field variations. Since the force on a unit test charge is given by the electric field, the tangent to a field line at any point demonstrates the direction of force. The spacing of the lines shows the relative changes in magnitude; where the lines are crowded together, the field is stronger. This method correlates with Coulomb's law, which states that the field decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the charge, and hence the line density also demonstrates this dependence.",

    "correct_answer": "In two-dimensional diagrams, electric field lines are drawn on a plane to represent their direction and relative density. However, in reality, electric fields exist in three dimensions. The concept of a unit cross-sectional area perpendicular to the field lines in three-dimensional space is critical because as the distance from the point charge increases, the surface area (which is proportional to r^2) increases, leading to a decrease in the density of field lines. The solid angle helps generalize the concept of an angle to three dimensions; it relates a small area element on a spherical surface to the number of field lines passing through that area, ensuring that, for a given solid angle, the number of field lines remains constant irrespective of the distance from the charge.",
    "explanation": "While diagrams drawn on paper reduce the three-dimensional field to two dimensions, understanding the three-dimensional nature means considering that field lines spread out over a spherical surface. The area of this surface grows as r^2, which exactly compensates for the 1/r^2 decrease in field strength, maintaining consistent electric flux. The solid angle concept is essential in making this connection and ensuring that the pictorial representation adheres to Coulomb’s law.",

    "correct_answer": "Electric field lines offer a straightforward visual interpretation of both the direction and relative magnitude of electric fields; the tangent to a line gives the field direction, and the density of lines indicates magnitude. However, there are limitations. They are a qualitative tool and may be drawn differently by different observers, which introduces subjectivity. Additionally, while they are accurate for field direction, they do not provide precise numerical values of field strength. In regions free from charge, the field lines are continuous, highlighting the conservative nature of the field; yet this method may not capture complexities in non-uniform fields or near boundaries with abrupt changes.",
    "explanation": "The concept of field lines developed by Faraday simplifies the understanding of electric fields by providing an intuitive visual model. Their use reveals critical properties like the conservative nature of electrostatic fields and the inverse-square law.

    "correct_answer": "It ensures that the electric field spreads out uniformly in space, leading to the net flux being proportional to the enclosed charge.",
    "explanation": "Coulomb's law shows that the electric field from a point charge decreases as the square of the distance.

    "correct_answer": "The derivation involves dividing the spherical surface into small area elements and using Coulomb's law, where the electric field at each point on the surface is E = q / (4π epsilon naught r^2). Since the field and the surface normal are in the same direction at every point on the sphere, the flux through each element is given by (q / (4π epsilon naught r^2)) delta S. Summing over the entire surface gives total flux = (q / (4π epsilon naught)) times the total area (4π r^2), resulting in flux = q / epsilon naught. Assumptions include uniform distance of the surface from the point charge and that the charge is enclosed entirely within the sphere.",
    "explanation": "This derivation uses the symmetry of the sphere to simplify the integration of the electric field over the surface.

    "correct_answer": "Gauss's law simplifies electric field calculations by allowing the use of a Gaussian surface that takes advantage of the symmetry present in the charge distribution. For example, for a point charge, selecting a spherical surface makes the electric field constant in magnitude over the surface. Similarly, in the case of an infinite line of charge, a cylindrical Gaussian surface can be used to easily derive the field, since the field remains constant at a fixed radial distance. This approach converts a potentially complex integration into a straightforward multiplication.",
    "explanation": "By choosing a Gaussian surface that aligns with the symmetry of the charge configuration, one can assume a constant electric field over portions of the surface, thereby reducing the integral to a multiplication of the field magnitude, the area, and the cosine of the angle between the field and the surface normal. This method is illustrated in the textbook examples involving spheres and cylinders.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Gauss's law is extremely useful in cases with high symmetry such as spherical, cylindrical, or planar charge distributions. However, its practical application is limited when the charge distribution lacks symmetry. In such cases, the electric field cannot be assumed constant over a chosen Gaussian surface, making the integration difficult or impossible to simplify. Furthermore, if the Gaussian surface passes through a point charge, the field is not well defined at that point, which further complicates the calculation.",
    "explanation": "The law remains universally true, but its usefulness in calculating the electric field relies on being able to choose an appropriate Gaussian surface. Without symmetry, the surface integral does not simplify to a product of a constant field and area, hence other methods such as direct integration or numerical simulation might be needed.",

    "correct_answer": "Treating a charge distribution as continuous assumes that each macroscopic element is large enough to contain a vast number of discrete charges, thereby smoothing out any microscopic fluctuations. While this approach simplifies calculations and is valid at macroscopic scales, it fails to capture phenomena that depend on the discrete nature of charge at microscopic scales. In systems where the individual charge properties are significant, such as at nano-scales or in quantum effects, the continuous approximation may not hold.",
