    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electrons in a conductor accelerate under an electric field between collisions, which would normally increase their velocity indefinitely. However, due to random collisions with the fixed ions in the metal, their velocities are randomized and lose memory of the acceleration. Over many electrons, the average velocity immediately after collision is zero. The constant, average net acceleration between collisions produces a steady drift velocity, which is given by the product of acceleration and the average collision time (relaxation time). Thus, even though electrons continuously speed up between collisions, their frequent interruptions set an upper bound, leading to a constant average drift velocity.",
    "explanation": "This explanation utilizes the concept of relaxation time (τ) and the periodic interruption of acceleration by collisions. While the instantaneous acceleration is given by a = -eE/m, the average effect over many electrons leads to a constant drift velocity, where the random components cancel out and only the small drift related to the average time between collisions remains.

Comparing this with Ohm's law in differential form j = σ E, it follows that σ = n e^2 τ/m.",
