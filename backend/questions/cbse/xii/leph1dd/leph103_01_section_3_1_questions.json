    "correct_answer": "In a torch, the steady electric current ensures that the light source (such as an LED or bulb) receives a constant flow of charge, allowing for continuous illumination. In a cell-driven clock, a steady current is crucial for timekeeping mechanisms, such as those in quartz clocks, where uniform charge flow helps in maintaining precise oscillations. Consistency in the current prevents fluctuations that could otherwise lead to erratic performance or inaccurate time measurement.",
    "explanation": "The explanation should detail that the steady current in both devices provides reliability and uniformity, which is essential for their operation. In a torch, it means consistent light output without flickering, and in a clock, it means accurate time measurement. The stability of the current is achieved through proper circuit design and regulation, highlighting the practical application of the concepts discussed in the section.",
