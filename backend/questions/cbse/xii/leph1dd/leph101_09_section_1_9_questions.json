When the surface is perpendicular to the field (θ = 0°), cosθ is 1, yielding maximum flux. When the surface is parallel to the field (θ = 90°), cosθ is 0, resulting in no flux.

    "explanation": "In the liquid flow analogy, the rate at which liquid crosses an area is given by v dS, where v is the velocity perpendicular to the area. Similarly, electric flux is defined as E dS cosθ, signifying the 'flow' of the electric field through the surface.

As the plate is rotated, a voltmeter (connected via appropriate circuitry) measures the induced potential which correlates with the flux passing through the plate.
