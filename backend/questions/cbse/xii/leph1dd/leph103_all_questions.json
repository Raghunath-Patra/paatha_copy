To mitigate these hazards, power lines are kept away from populated areas and insulated properly, and transformers are used to step down the voltage before distribution to consumers.",

    "correct_answer": "The resistance R of a conductor is given by R = ρl/A. This implies that if the length (l) of a conductor increases while the cross-sectional area (A) remains constant, the resistance increases proportionally. For example, doubling the length doubles the resistance. Conversely, if the cross-sectional area increases while the length remains constant, the resistance decreases because the current has more pathways to flow. For instance, doubling the cross-sectional area halves the resistance. Thus, resistance is directly proportional to length and inversely proportional to area.",
    "explanation": "This analysis uses the formula R = ρl/A.

By dividing both sides by the cross-sectional area A, we define current density as j = I/A and note that the potential difference V can be expressed as E l (with a uniform electric field E). Thus, we obtain E l = j ρ l, which simplifies to E = j ρ. In its vector form, since both electric field and current density have directions, the law is written as E = ρ j or alternatively j = σ E, where σ is the conductivity (σ = 1/ρ). This vector form emphasizes that the current density vector is in the direction of the electric field, reflecting directional properties in a medium.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts with V = I R, transforms the terms into density and field expressions, and then uses the formula for resistance R = ρl/A. Dividing through by l leads to E = j ρ.

    "correct_answer": "By recognizing that symmetrically placed paths carry identical currents, one can reduce the number of independent variables in the system. In the cube, currents through symmetrically equivalent edges are equal, which allows applying Kirchhoff's rules with fewer unknowns, simplifying the analysis of the circuit.",

By assigning the same current (I) to these equivalent branches, the equations derived from Kirchhoff's junction and loop rules become simpler, enabling easier calculation of the equivalent resistance.

    "correct_answer": "Electrons in a conductor accelerate under an electric field between collisions, which would normally increase their velocity indefinitely. However, due to random collisions with the fixed ions in the metal, their velocities are randomized and lose memory of the acceleration. Over many electrons, the average velocity immediately after collision is zero. The constant, average net acceleration between collisions produces a steady drift velocity, which is given by the product of acceleration and the average collision time (relaxation time). Thus, even though electrons continuously speed up between collisions, their frequent interruptions set an upper bound, leading to a constant average drift velocity.",
    "explanation": "This explanation utilizes the concept of relaxation time (τ) and the periodic interruption of acceleration by collisions. While the instantaneous acceleration is given by a = -eE/m, the average effect over many electrons leads to a constant drift velocity, where the random components cancel out and only the small drift related to the average time between collisions remains.

This extra voltage drop affects the current distribution in the circuit. The mesh analysis would need to incorporate the internal resistance in one or more loops. Although the balance condition (Ig = 0) still yields a relation between the resistors, the measured terminal voltage would be lower than the ideal battery voltage, and the exact equations would include terms related to the internal resistance. Therefore, more complex equations would be required to achieve balance, and the simple relation R2/R1 = R4/R3 might need correction factors to account for the internal resistance.",

    "explanation": "Nominal current is I = 0.01 C / 0.002 s = 5 A. With ±10% uncertainty, ΔQ can vary between 0.009 C and 0.011 C, and Δt between 0.0018 s and 0.0022 s. The maximum current occurs with the highest ΔQ and smallest Δt: I_max = 0.011 / 0.0018 ≈ 6.11 A. The minimum current occurs with the smallest ΔQ and largest Δt: I_min = 0.009 / 0.0022 ≈ 4.09 A.

For cell 2: I2 = (4 V - 4.5 V) / 2 Ω = -0.25 A (negative indicates reverse current). The net current from the pack is I1 + I2 = 0.5 A - 0.25 A = 0.25 A. However, note that if the load voltage is forced to be 4.5 V, the actual current distribution will be such that the stronger cell (cell 1) supplies current and cell 2 might absorb current, leading to circulating currents. Alternatively, if both cells supply current to meet the load, one solves the combined equations: Using the formulas for parallel combination, 1/req = 1/1 + 1/2 = 1.5 so req ≈ 0.67 Ω and εeq calculated by (ε1/r1 + ε2/r2)/ (1/r1 + 1/r2) = ((5/1)+(4/2))/(1+0.5) = (5+2)/1.5 = 7/1.5 ≈ 4.67 V. Then total current I = (εeq - V) / req = (4.67 V - 4.5 V)/0.67 Ω ≈ 0.25 A. Thus, the net current delivered to the load is approximately 0.25 A.

When the circuit is closed by connecting a resistor R, the cell produces an emf, which drives a current through the circuit. As current flows through the resistor, electrical energy is converted into heat energy due to the resistor's opposition to the current (Ohm's law). This sequential conversion demonstrates how internal chemical energy ultimately dissipates as thermal energy in the resistor.",
    "explanation": "The cell’s electrodes, which are dipped in an electrolyte solution, develop individual potential differences due to chemical reactions. The net emf, defined as the sum of these potential differences, powers the circuit. According to Ohm's law, V = I R, a current I flows through the resistor.

    "correct_answer": "Electrolytic cells typically have lower internal resistance compared to dry cells, meaning they can deliver higher currents and have a higher terminal voltage under load. Dry cells, having higher internal resistance, suffer a greater voltage drop when current flows, thereby reducing output voltage and efficiency. As internal resistance increases, the maximum current (Imax = ε / r) that can be safely drawn decreases, affecting the overall efficiency and performance of the cell.",
    "explanation": "Lower internal resistance in electrolytic cells causes a smaller voltage drop within the cell, which results in more efficient energy transfer to the external circuit. Dry cells, although convenient, have higher internal resistance that limits the current and causes significant power losses as heat.

    "correct_answer": "Materials are classified into conductors, semiconductors, and insulators based on their resistivity values. Conductors, such as metals, have low resistivities in the range of 10⁻⁸ Ωm to 10⁻⁶ Ωm. Semiconductors have intermediate resistivities that typically decrease with increasing temperature and can be further modified by doping. Insulators, including materials like ceramics, rubber, and plastics, have extremely high resistivities, about 10¹⁸ times greater than metals.",
    "explanation": "The answer outlines the three primary categories. It explains that metals are used as conductors due to their low resistivity, semiconductors are temperature dependent and sensitive to doping, and insulators are characterized by very high resistivity, limiting current flow.",

    "correct_answer": "Temperature increases lead to a decrease in resistivity in semiconductors because more electrons gain enough energy to jump into the conduction band, resulting in enhanced conductivity. In contrast, metals typically show an increase in resistivity with rising temperature due to enhanced lattice vibrations scattering the electrons. Doping in semiconductors introduces extra charge carriers, reducing resistivity further and allowing tailored conductivity for electronic devices.",
    "explanation": "The answer compares temperature effects where metals see an increase in resistivity due to phonon scattering, while semiconductors experience a decrease due to increased carrier generation.

    "correct_answer": "When measuring the resistivity of a metal, the very low resistivity values demand precise instruments to avoid errors from contact resistance and temperature variations. In contrast, insulators have extremely high resistivities, and leakage currents or imperfect insulation can affect measurements. Factors such as sample geometry, temperature, purity of the material, and surface contact quality play significant roles in both cases.",
    "explanation": "The answer discusses the challenges in measuring low resistivity in metals (e.g., correcting for contact resistance and temperature effects) versus the challenges in measuring very high resistivity in insulators (e.g., dealing with leakage currents and ensuring accurate insulation).
