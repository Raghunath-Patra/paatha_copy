Additionally, the Biot-Savart law contains an angular dependence (sinθ) which is not present in Coulomb's law.",
    "explanation": "Both laws share a similar mathematical form in terms of distance dependence (1/r² for the magnitude), but they differ in that the electric field is produced by scalar quantities (charges) while the magnetic field arises from moving charges (current elements) and is determined by the cross product, leading to its perpendicular orientation.

This implies that the values of μ₀ and ε₀ are not arbitrary but are constrained by the constant speed of light, which is a fundamental constant in nature. This relation is significant because it bridges the concepts of electricity and magnetism with the propagation of electromagnetic waves, ultimately forming a cornerstone of Maxwell's equations.",
