    "correct_answer": "Equipotential surfaces provide a view of regions of constant potential, which can clarify the energy landscape and illustrate where no work is done in moving a charge. Electric field lines, on the other hand, clearly indicate the direction and relative strength of the field. Depending on the problem, equipotentials might better illustrate potential barriers and energy gradients, while field lines are preferable for visualizing force directions.",
    "explanation": "While electric field lines show the direction and relative magnitude of the field (the density of lines indicates strength), equipotential surfaces reveal how potential changes in space. For example, when designing experiments or understanding energy transitions, knowing the potential distribution is key. Conversely, field lines are valuable when considering the forces on charges.

For two identical positive charges, near each charge the equipotentials appear nearly spherical, but further away the surfaces begin to merge into larger, deformed shapes that reflect the influence of both charges. The equipotentials around the two-charge system eventually form a single, more complex surface enclosing both charges.",
    "explanation": "In a single point charge scenario, the potential solely depends on the radial distance, leading to spherical symmetry. When two like charges are present, their fields superimpose. At points remote from both charges, the potential is a sum of two similar contributions, and the equipotential surfaces reflect a combined field that is less symmetric than a sphere, often forming elongated ellipsoidal shapes.

Rearranging gives |E| = |ΔV| / Δl. This derivation shows that E is in the direction of maximum decrease in potential.",
    "explanation": "Consider two closely-spaced equipotential surfaces with potentials V and (V + ΔV). Moving a unit charge from one surface to the other, the work done against the electric field is E * Δl. By energy conservation, this work equals the negative of the potential difference, leading to the equation E * Δl = -ΔV. Dividing by Δl and taking magnitudes, we obtain |E| = |ΔV| / Δl.
