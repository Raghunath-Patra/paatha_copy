    "explanation": "For a circular coil, the magnetic field at the centre is given by B = (μ0 × N × I) / (2 × R). With μ0 = 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A, N = 100, I = 0.40 A, and R = 0.08 m (8.0 cm), we calculate B = (4π × 10^-7 × 100 × 0.40) / (2 × 0.08). Simplifying, (4π × 10^-7 × 40) = 160π × 10^-7, and dividing by 0.16 gives (160π/0.16) × 10^-7 = 1000π × 10^-7, which is π × 10^-4 or about 3.14 × 10^-4 T.",

The numerator calculates to about 37.8×10^-3 and the denominator to 27×10^-3, so the ratio is approximately 1.4. Voltage sensitivity is the current sensitivity divided by the resistance. Thus, the ratio is (current sensitivity of M2 / R2) / (current sensitivity of M1 / R1) = (N2 × A2 × B2 × R1) / (N1 × A1 × B1 × R2).
