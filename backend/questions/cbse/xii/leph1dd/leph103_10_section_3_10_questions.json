    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In an electrolytic cell, the chemical energy stored in the electrolyte is converted into electrical energy as a result of the redox reactions at the electrodes. When the circuit is closed by connecting a resistor R, the cell produces an emf, which drives a current through the circuit. As current flows through the resistor, electrical energy is converted into heat energy due to the resistor's opposition to the current (Ohm's law). This sequential conversion demonstrates how internal chemical energy ultimately dissipates as thermal energy in the resistor.",
    "explanation": "The cell’s electrodes, which are dipped in an electrolyte solution, develop individual potential differences due to chemical reactions. The net emf, defined as the sum of these potential differences, powers the circuit. According to Ohm's law, V = I R, a current I flows through the resistor. The resistor then converts the electrical energy into heat energy. This process exemplifies energy conversion from chemical to electrical, and finally, to thermal energy.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electrolytic cells typically have lower internal resistance compared to dry cells, meaning they can deliver higher currents and have a higher terminal voltage under load. Dry cells, having higher internal resistance, suffer a greater voltage drop when current flows, thereby reducing output voltage and efficiency. As internal resistance increases, the maximum current (Imax = ε / r) that can be safely drawn decreases, affecting the overall efficiency and performance of the cell.",
    "explanation": "Lower internal resistance in electrolytic cells causes a smaller voltage drop within the cell, which results in more efficient energy transfer to the external circuit. Dry cells, although convenient, have higher internal resistance that limits the current and causes significant power losses as heat. A high internal resistance implies that a significant fraction of the emf is lost within the cell rather than being delivered to the load, hence affecting performance.",
