    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Magnetic flux is central to Faraday's law, which states that a change in magnetic flux through a circuit induces an electromotive force (emf) in the circuit. This relationship is mathematically represented by emf = -d(φ_B)/dt. The negative sign indicates that the induced emf opposes the change in flux (Lenz's law). Thus, any variation in the magnetic field, the area of the loop, or the orientation (angle) between the field and the loop will result in an induced emf. This principle is fundamental to the operation of electrical generators, transformers, and many other devices.",
    "explanation": "Faraday's law connects a changing magnetic environment with the generation of electrical energy in a circuit. The induced emf is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux, underscoring the importance of flux as a measure of how much magnetic field penetrates a given area.

    "correct_answer": "The magnetic flux through a flat surface is given by the dot product of the magnetic field vector B and the area vector A. By definition, this is φ_B = B · A. The area vector has a magnitude equal to the area A and a direction perpendicular to the surface. When the magnetic field makes an angle θ with the area vector, the dot product evaluates to φ_B = BA cosθ. The factor cosθ accounts for the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the surface; when θ is 0°, the entire magnetic field contributes to the flux, and when θ is 90°, no flux passes through the surface.",
    "explanation": "Starting from the definition of the dot product, B · A = BA cosθ, we see that only the perpendicular component of the magnetic field contributes toward flux. This derivation shows the importance of both the magnitude of the magnetic field and its orientation with respect to the surface, providing a clear physical picture of why the flux is maximum when the field is perpendicular.",
