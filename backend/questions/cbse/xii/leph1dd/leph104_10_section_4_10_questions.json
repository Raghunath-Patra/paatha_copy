    "correct_answer": "To convert a galvanometer into an ammeter, a shunt resistor of very small value is connected in parallel with the galvanometer. This bypasses most of the current away from the galvanometer, which is highly sensitive and has a high resistance. With the shunt in place, the effective resistance of the instrument is reduced, minimizing its impact on the circuit. The full-scale current of the galvanometer is thereby increased, and the instrument can accurately measure larger currents without significantly affecting the overall circuit current.",
    "explanation": "The shunt allows the majority of the current to flow through it while only a negligible portion passes through the galvanometer coil. This modification enables accurate current measurement by preventing the galvanometer's high resistance from altering the circuit conditions.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Starting with the magnetic torque τ = NIAB (since sinθ = 1 in a radial magnetic field) and equating it to the restoring torque kφ, we have kφ = NIAB. Solving for φ gives φ = (NAB/k)I. This expression shows that the deflection is directly proportional to the current I. Increasing the number of turns N, the area A, or the magnetic field strength B will increase the sensitivity (greater deflection per unit current), while a larger torsional constant k (stiffer spring) will decrease the sensitivity.",
    "explanation": "The derivation uses the balance of torques at equilibrium. The sensitivity of the galvanometer, defined as φ/I, is thus NAB/k. This informs the design: to achieve high sensitivity, one can increase N, A, or B, or use a less stiff spring (smaller k).",

This reduces the effective resistance and diverts most of the current away from the sensitive coil, allowing for the measurement of higher currents without significantly altering the circuit. In contrast, when converting a galvanometer into a voltmeter, a large resistor is connected in series with the galvanometer. This increases the total resistance so that when the voltmeter is connected in parallel with the circuit component, it draws only a very small current, minimizing the disturbance to the circuit. Thus, the key difference is the use of a parallel resistor in the ammeter configuration and a series resistor in the voltmeter configuration.",
    "explanation": "The different configurations are dictated by the need to either divert most of the current (ammeter) or to limit the current drawn (voltmeter) so that the measurement does not affect the rest of the circuit.
