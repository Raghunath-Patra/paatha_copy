    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When an external electric field is applied to a dielectric, each molecule develops a dipole moment (either induced or from aligning permanent dipoles). Within the bulk of the material, the positive end of one dipole is nearly adjacent to the negative end of its neighbor, resulting in charge cancellation. However, at the surfaces perpendicular to the electric field, there is no adjacent dipole to neutralize the charge. Consequently, the positive ends accumulate on one surface and the negative ends on the opposite surface, creating induced surface charge densities.",
    "explanation": "This process starts at the molecular level where disruption of charge symmetry occurs upon application of the field. In the interior, the close proximity of opposite charges cancels any net charge, but at the boundaries the lack of neighboring molecules allows the dipole charges to appear as surface charges. These bound surface charges then generate an internal field that opposes the external field.",

    "correct_answer": "Non-polar molecules, such as O₂ or H₂, have symmetrical charge distributions and thus no permanent dipole moment. When placed in an external field, these molecules are polarized by a slight displacement of their electron clouds, inducing a dipole moment proportional to the field. In contrast, polar molecules, such as H₂O or HCl, already possess a permanent dipole moment due to an uneven charge distribution. At zero field, the orientations of these dipoles are random due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net polarization. However, when an external field is applied, the dipoles tend to align with the field, and the net effect is a significant polarization of the dielectric.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the origin of the dipole moments. For non-polar molecules, the dipole is entirely induced by the field, while for polar molecules, the field aligns pre-existing dipoles.

This increased polarization results in a greater induced field that opposes the external field, leading to a more noticeable reduction in the effective internal field of the dielectric.",
    "explanation": "Electric susceptibility is a measure of the material's response to an applied field. At the macroscopic level, it determines the extent to which the internal field is reduced due to polarization.
