    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electric field lines provide a visual representation where their tangent at any point gives the direction of the electric field. The arrow on the line indicates the direction from positive towards negative charges. The density of the lines represents the magnitude of the field: a higher density means a stronger field. Additionally, while arrow length in some diagrams might also be scaled to indicate field strength, the primary indicator in field line diagrams is the number of lines per unit area, which decreases as 1/r^2 from a point charge.",
    "explanation": "The use of electric field lines was introduced for a qualitative understanding of field variations. Since the force on a unit test charge is given by the electric field, the tangent to a field line at any point demonstrates the direction of force. The spacing of the lines shows the relative changes in magnitude; where the lines are crowded together, the field is stronger. This method correlates with Coulomb's law, which states that the field decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the charge, and hence the line density also demonstrates this dependence.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In two-dimensional diagrams, electric field lines are drawn on a plane to represent their direction and relative density. However, in reality, electric fields exist in three dimensions. The concept of a unit cross-sectional area perpendicular to the field lines in three-dimensional space is critical because as the distance from the point charge increases, the surface area (which is proportional to r^2) increases, leading to a decrease in the density of field lines. The solid angle helps generalize the concept of an angle to three dimensions; it relates a small area element on a spherical surface to the number of field lines passing through that area, ensuring that, for a given solid angle, the number of field lines remains constant irrespective of the distance from the charge.",
    "explanation": "While diagrams drawn on paper reduce the three-dimensional field to two dimensions, understanding the three-dimensional nature means considering that field lines spread out over a spherical surface. The area of this surface grows as r^2, which exactly compensates for the 1/r^2 decrease in field strength, maintaining consistent electric flux. The solid angle concept is essential in making this connection and ensuring that the pictorial representation adheres to Coulomb’s law.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electric field lines offer a straightforward visual interpretation of both the direction and relative magnitude of electric fields; the tangent to a line gives the field direction, and the density of lines indicates magnitude. However, there are limitations. They are a qualitative tool and may be drawn differently by different observers, which introduces subjectivity. Additionally, while they are accurate for field direction, they do not provide precise numerical values of field strength. In regions free from charge, the field lines are continuous, highlighting the conservative nature of the field; yet this method may not capture complexities in non-uniform fields or near boundaries with abrupt changes.",
    "explanation": "The concept of field lines developed by Faraday simplifies the understanding of electric fields by providing an intuitive visual model. Their use reveals critical properties like the conservative nature of electrostatic fields and the inverse-square law. However, discrepancies in representation and the inability to quantify precise field strengths are limitations. Evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of this method underscores its importance as a conceptual tool rather than a precise quantitative instrument.",
