    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Polarity of charge refers to the existence of two types of electric charge—positive and negative. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, electrons are transferred from the rod to the silk. This results in the glass rod having a deficiency of electrons (making it positive) and the silk having an excess (making it negative). The law of like charges repelling and opposites attracting explains the subsequent behavior of the charged objects.",
    "explanation": "The concept of polarity of charge is fundamental in understanding electrostatic phenomena. In the example given, friction causes electrons, which are loosely bound, to move from the glass rod to the silk cloth. With the loss of electrons, the glass rod becomes positively charged. Meanwhile, the silk gains electrons and becomes negatively charged. This difference, or polarity, is why the charged bodies exhibit attraction when brought near one another, and why like-charged objects repel each other. Various experiments, including the observation with gold‐leaf electroscope, further demonstrate these principles.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiments with different material pairs show that when objects are rubbed together, they acquire charges of opposite sign. For example, a glass rod rubbed with silk becomes positive while the silk becomes negative, and similarly for a plastic rod rubbed with cat's fur. When these objects are brought near each other, the attraction between opposite charges and repulsion between like charges is consistently observed. Using various materials helps confirm that the phenomenon is due to the inherent property of electrons and not an artifact of a single substance.",
    "explanation": "The experiments are designed so that by rubbing different pairs of materials, one can observe the transfer of electrons based on the different electron affinities of the materials involved. For instance, when a glass rod and silk interact, electrons move from the glass to the silk (or vice versa in other combinations), leading to a net positive charge on one and a net negative charge on the other. The consistent observation that like charges repel and unlike charges attract across several pairs of materials reinforces the generality of the electrical force. This approach also eliminates biases that could arise from using a single pair and helps in establishing the fundamental law of electrostatics.",

    "explanation": "The study of electric forces provides crucial insights into how individual atoms and molecules interact. Attractive forces between differently charged regions of atoms help hold molecules together, contributing to molecular cohesion. Similarly, adhesive forces, which are critical in phenomena like glue sticking, and surface tension, observed in liquids, are both manifestations of electrostatic interactions.
