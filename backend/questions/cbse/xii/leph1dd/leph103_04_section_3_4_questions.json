    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "The resistance R of a conductor is given by R = ρl/A. This implies that if the length (l) of a conductor increases while the cross-sectional area (A) remains constant, the resistance increases proportionally. For example, doubling the length doubles the resistance. Conversely, if the cross-sectional area increases while the length remains constant, the resistance decreases because the current has more pathways to flow. For instance, doubling the cross-sectional area halves the resistance. Thus, resistance is directly proportional to length and inversely proportional to area.",
    "explanation": "This analysis uses the formula R = ρl/A. The direct proportionality with length means that longer conductors have more resistance, and the inverse relationship with area indicates that a larger area allows easier current flow, reducing resistance.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ohm's law in its conventional form is V = I R. By dividing both sides by the cross-sectional area A, we define current density as j = I/A and note that the potential difference V can be expressed as E l (with a uniform electric field E). Thus, we obtain E l = j ρ l, which simplifies to E = j ρ. In its vector form, since both electric field and current density have directions, the law is written as E = ρ j or alternatively j = σ E, where σ is the conductivity (σ = 1/ρ). This vector form emphasizes that the current density vector is in the direction of the electric field, reflecting directional properties in a medium.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts with V = I R, transforms the terms into density and field expressions, and then uses the formula for resistance R = ρl/A. Dividing through by l leads to E = j ρ. The vector notation j = σ E further generalizes the relation, making it applicable even when fields vary with direction, which is crucial when analyzing anisotropic materials.",
