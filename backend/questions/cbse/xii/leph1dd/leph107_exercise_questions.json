    "correct_answer": "(a) Approximately 0.4545 A; (b) 100 W",
    "explanation": "For a purely resistive circuit, the resistor’s value can be determined using P = V²/R, so R = 220²/100 ≈ 484 Ω. The rms current is then I_rms = V_rms/R = 220/484 ≈ 0.4545 A. Since the resistor dissipates power continuously, the net (average) power over a full cycle is equal to 100 W.",

    "explanation": "The rms voltage is V_rms = V_peak/sqrt(2), so 300/1.414 is about 212 V. Similarly, the peak current is I_peak = I_rms * sqrt(2), so 10 * 1.414 ≈ 14.1 A.",

    "explanation": "Pure inductors and pure capacitors do not dissipate energy; they alternately store and return energy to the circuit.

    "explanation": "Resonance in a series LCR circuit occurs when the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance. The resonant frequency is f_r = 1/(2π√(LC)). With L = 5.0 H and C = 80 μF (80e-6 F), f_r ≈ 1/(2π√(5×80e-6)) ≈ 7.96 Hz. At resonance, the impedance Z equals R (40 Ω), so the rms current is I_rms = 230/40 ≈ 5.75 A. The reactances are X_L = ωL and X_C = 1/(ωC), where ω = 2πf ≈ 50 rad/s; both turn out to be 250 Ω. The rms voltage drops across L and C are I_rms × 250, approximately 1437.5 V each, but they are 180° out of phase so they cancel, leaving only the resistor drop equal to the source voltage.",
