    "correct_answer": "In metals, the resistivity increases with temperature because the number of free electrons remains nearly constant, and the average time between collisions (τ) decreases due to increased electron speed. The relation ρ = m / (n e² τ) implies that with constant n, the decrease in τ leads to higher resistivity. In semiconductors, however, increasing temperature causes a substantial increase in the number of free charge carriers n, which more than compensates for any decrease in τ, resulting in a decrease in resistivity. The linear relation ρT = ρ0 [1 + α (T - T0)] is typically applicable for metals over a limited temperature range, but semiconductors exhibit an inverse or non-linear relationship.",
    "explanation": "This answer contrasts the effects of temperature change on metals and semiconductors. Metals follow ρ = m / (n e² τ) where n is nearly constant; thus an increase in temperature leads to decreased τ and increased ρ.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The linear equation ρT = ρ0 [1 + α (T - T0)] is only valid for limited temperature ranges where the resistivity changes approximately linearly with temperature. Over large temperature ranges, particularly at very low temperatures, the relationship becomes non-linear due to additional quantum effects and changes in electron-phonon interactions. Deviations occur because the material properties, such as electron scattering mechanisms, are no longer constant, and the assumption of constant α fails.",
    "explanation": "The answer details that the linear approximation is based on the assumption that the temperature coefficient α remains constant.
