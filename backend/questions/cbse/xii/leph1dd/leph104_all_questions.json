With μ0 = 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A, N = 100, I = 0.40 A, and R = 0.08 m (8.0 cm), we calculate B = (4π × 10^-7 × 100 × 0.40) / (2 × 0.08).

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a solenoid is not long enough relative to its radius, edge effects become significant, and the magnetic field is no longer uniformly confined within its interior. The uniform field assumption breaks down, leading to a non-uniform field distribution with significant transverse components and a non-negligible external field.",
    "explanation": "The long solenoid approximation assumes that the field lines are parallel and uniform inside and negligible outside. When the length is not much larger than the radius, the field lines spread out near the ends, causing fringing effects that result in a decreased field strength inside and increased field irregularity at the ends. This complicates calculations and may require numerical methods or more advanced analytical techniques.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Inserting a soft iron core into a solenoid increases the magnetic field inside due to the high magnetic permeability of soft iron compared to air. This core concentrates the magnetic field lines, reducing the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, and thereby enhancing the field strength according to the relation B = µ n I, where µ becomes significantly larger.",
    "explanation": "Soft iron, being a ferromagnetic material, can be easily magnetized and has a high permeability. This leads to better confinement and concentration of the magnetic field lines inside the core, substantially increasing the effective magnetic field. This is why solenoids with soft iron cores often produce much larger and more uniform magnetic fields than air-core solenoids.",

In the experimental setup, two conductors are placed one meter apart in a controlled environment (vacuum or with stray magnetic fields eliminated). The magnetic force per unit length, which is given by f = (μ₀ I_a I_b) / (2πd) with d = 1 m, is measured accurately. The ampere is defined such that this force equals 2 × 10⁻⁷ newtons per meter when equal currents flow through the wires. Thus, by measuring the force per unit length and ensuring that experimental conditions remove external influences like the Earth’s magnetic field, the current producing this force is standardized as one ampere.",
    "explanation": "The procedure involves setting up long, parallel conductors, controlling environmental magnetic effects, and using sensitive instruments (current balance) to measure the tiny force generated by the currents.

Additionally, any straight segments attached to the semicircular arc contribute no magnetic field at the center because the current element and the displacement vector are parallel.",

The full-scale current of the galvanometer is thereby increased, and the instrument can accurately measure larger currents without significantly affecting the overall circuit current.",
    "explanation": "The shunt allows the majority of the current to flow through it while only a negligible portion passes through the galvanometer coil.

    "correct_answer": "Starting with the magnetic torque τ = NIAB (since sinθ = 1 in a radial magnetic field) and equating it to the restoring torque kφ, we have kφ = NIAB. Solving for φ gives φ = (NAB/k)I. This expression shows that the deflection is directly proportional to the current I.

In contrast, when converting a galvanometer into a voltmeter, a large resistor is connected in series with the galvanometer. This increases the total resistance so that when the voltmeter is connected in parallel with the circuit component, it draws only a very small current, minimizing the disturbance to the circuit. Thus, the key difference is the use of a parallel resistor in the ammeter configuration and a series resistor in the voltmeter configuration.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The pitch (p) of the helical path is given by p = v₍∥₎T, where v₍∥₎ is the component of velocity parallel to the magnetic field and T is the period of one complete rotation (T = 2πm/qB). Thus, it depends on the parallel velocity, mass of the particle, its charge, and the magnetic field strength.",
    "explanation": "The pitch of the helix represents the linear distance along the magnetic field achieved in one rotation. It is calculated by multiplying the parallel component of the velocity (which remains unaffected by the magnetic field) with the period of rotation determined by the magnetic field and particle properties.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Starting with the fact that the magnetic force acts as the centripetal force in circular motion, we equate q·v·B (magnetic force) to m·v²/r (centripetal force). Rearranging the equation: m·v²/r = q·v·B  -->  r = (m·v)/(q·B).",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins by recognizing that for a particle moving in a circle, the required centripetal force is m·v²/r. Since the magnetic force, given by q·v·B when the motion is perpendicular to B, acts as this centripetal force, setting m·v²/r equal to q·v·B and solving for r yields r = m·v/(q·B). This shows that the radius increases with momentum and decreases with higher charge or magnetic field strength.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The angular frequency (ω) of a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by ω = q·B/m, which is independent of the particle's speed. Since the rotational frequency ν is ω/2π, it also does not depend on the speed. This independence is exploited in cyclotron design because a constant frequency of the accelerating electric field can be used to accelerate particles over a range of energies. It simplifies synchronization between the particle motion and the accelerating field, ensuring efficient energy gain at each pass through the accelerating region.",
    "explanation": "Because the magnetic force only changes the direction of the velocity and not its magnitude, the formula for angular frequency derived from equating the magnetic force to the centripetal force shows no dependency on v. As a result, even as particles gain energy and their speeds increase, their frequency remains constant. This property is fundamental to the operation of cyclotrons, which rely on a fixed radio frequency to accelerate particles through repeated passage in the gap between dees.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a charged particle enters a magnetic field, its velocity can be decomposed into two components: one parallel to the magnetic field and one perpendicular to it. The perpendicular component causes the particle to experience a force that results in circular motion. Meanwhile, the parallel component remains unaffected by the magnetic field and causes the particle to move linearly along the field direction. The combination of circular motion (due to the perpendicular component) and linear motion (due to the parallel component) produces a helical trajectory. In contrast, if the velocity is entirely perpendicular to the field, there is no linear component and the particle follows a perfect circle.",

In particle accelerators like cyclotrons, this allows a constant-frequency alternating electric field to be used for acceleration, simplifying the design and ensuring that particles can be accelerated efficiently over many cycles.",
