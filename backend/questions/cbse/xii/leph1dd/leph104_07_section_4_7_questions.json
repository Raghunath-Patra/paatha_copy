The other sides either experience zero field or are perpendicular to the field. The enclosed current is the current I multiplied by the number of turns enclosed, which is n × h. Thus, the law gives B × h = µ0 × I(n × h) leading to B = µ0 n I.",
    "explanation": "By selecting an Amperian loop that follows the interior and exterior of the solenoid, only the segment inside contributes.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a solenoid is not long enough relative to its radius, edge effects become significant, and the magnetic field is no longer uniformly confined within its interior. The uniform field assumption breaks down, leading to a non-uniform field distribution with significant transverse components and a non-negligible external field.",
    "explanation": "The long solenoid approximation assumes that the field lines are parallel and uniform inside and negligible outside. When the length is not much larger than the radius, the field lines spread out near the ends, causing fringing effects that result in a decreased field strength inside and increased field irregularity at the ends. This complicates calculations and may require numerical methods or more advanced analytical techniques.",

    "correct_answer": "Inserting a soft iron core into a solenoid increases the magnetic field inside due to the high magnetic permeability of soft iron compared to air. This core concentrates the magnetic field lines, reducing the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, and thereby enhancing the field strength according to the relation B = µ n I, where µ becomes significantly larger.",
    "explanation": "Soft iron, being a ferromagnetic material, can be easily magnetized and has a high permeability. This leads to better confinement and concentration of the magnetic field lines inside the core, substantially increasing the effective magnetic field. This is why solenoids with soft iron cores often produce much larger and more uniform magnetic fields than air-core solenoids.",
