The magnetic force per unit length, which is given by f = (μ₀ I_a I_b) / (2πd) with d = 1 m, is measured accurately. The ampere is defined such that this force equals 2 × 10⁻⁷ newtons per meter when equal currents flow through the wires. Thus, by measuring the force per unit length and ensuring that experimental conditions remove external influences like the Earth’s magnetic field, the current producing this force is standardized as one ampere.",

The field, which is uniform along the length of the second conductor, then interacts with the current in the second conductor as described by the Lorentz force law (F = I L x B).
