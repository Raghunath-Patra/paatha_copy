This addition makes Maxwell’s equations more symmetrical and leads directly to the prediction of self-propagating electromagnetic waves, as the mutual generation of time-varying electric and magnetic fields enables wave propagation through space.",

In some texts, the flux is taken as E times area, where E = Q/(Aε₀). Then dPhi_E/dt = (A/ε₀)(d(Q/A)/dt) simplifies to (1/ε₀)(dQ/dt). Thus the answer remains 2/(8.85×10⁻¹²) ≈ 2.26×10¹¹ Wb/s.
