    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Capacitance ≈ 8.0 pF and dV/dt ≈ 1.88 × 10^10 V/s",
    "explanation": "The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by C = ε₀A/d, where A = πr² with r = 0.12 m and d = 0.05 m. Evaluating, A ≈ π × (0.12)² ≈ 0.04524 m² and then C ≈ (8.85×10⁻¹² F/m × 0.04524 m²) / 0.05 m ≈ 8.0×10⁻¹² F or 8.0 pF. The rate of change of voltage is dV/dt = i/C = 0.15 A / (8.0×10⁻¹² F) ≈ 1.88×10^10 V/s.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "0.15 A",
    "explanation": "The displacement current is defined as i_d = ε₀ (dΦ_E/dt). Since the electric flux Φ_E between the plates is given by Q/ε₀, its time derivative dΦ_E/dt equals (dQ/dt)/ε₀, which is i/ε₀. Multiplying by ε₀ gives i_d = i = 0.15 A. This shows that the displacement current equals the conduction current in this situation.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Kirchhoff's junction rule is not strictly valid if only conduction currents are considered; however, when the displacement current is included, the total current is continuous and the rule holds.",
    "explanation": "At a capacitor plate, no conduction current flows in the gap between the plates causing an apparent discontinuity. Maxwell's introduction of the displacement current, which accounts for the changing electric field between the plates, restores current continuity. Thus, when the displacement current is added to the conduction current, Kirchhoff’s junction rule is effectively valid.",
