This concept, as demonstrated by Faraday and Henry, is integral to the functioning of modern electrical devices. For example, in electrical generators, mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy by rotating coils within magnetic fields, while in transformers, alternating current in the primary coil produces a changing magnetic field that induces a voltage in the secondary coil. These devices have become essential for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, powering everything from household appliances to large-scale industrial machinery.",

    "correct_answer": "Faraday and Henry conducted experiments by observing the effects of relative motion between magnets and coils, and by varying the magnetic field intensity near closed circuits. Their methodologies involved controlling variables such as the rate of change of the magnetic field and the alignment of the magnet relative to the coil. Potential sources of error could include inconsistent motion, fluctuations in the magnetic field, and measurement inaccuracies in current detection. Despite these challenges, their experiments provided conclusive evidence of electromagnetic induction, bridging the gap between theoretical physics and practical electrical applications. This revolutionized technology by enabling the development of devices like generators and transformers, fundamentally altering the course of industrial and technological progress.",
