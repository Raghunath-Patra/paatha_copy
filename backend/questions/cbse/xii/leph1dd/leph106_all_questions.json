    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The induced current will always be in the direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux. For instance, when a North pole of a magnet approaches a loop, the induced current creates a magnetic field with its North pole facing the approaching magnet (and vice versa); for a decreasing field or a current change in a neighboring loop, Lenz's law similarly provides the qualitative direction.",
    "explanation": "According to Lenz's law, the induced current flows in such a direction that the magnetic field created by it opposes the change in magnetic flux. In the cases shown in Fig. 6.15, examine the direction of motion or change of the external magnetic field and then determine the polarity of the induced field required to oppose that change. The specific answer will depend on the details in each diagram, but the overall principle is that the induced magnetic field always opposes the flux change.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In both cases, the induced current will flow such that the magnetic field created by it opposes the change in the loop’s effective area (and hence the magnetic flux). In (a), as the irregular wire becomes more circular, the flux increases; the induced current produces a field opposing that increase. In (b), as the circular loop is deformed into a narrow straight wire, the flux decreases; the induced current will try to maintain the original flux by producing a field in the same direction as the original field.",
    "explanation": "Lenz's law states that the induced current opposes the change in magnetic flux. In these deformation problems, the effective area (and thus the flux) is changing. For the irregular-to-circular change, an increase in flux is opposed by an induced current whose magnetic field opposes the enhanced flux. Conversely, when a circular loop becomes narrow, the reduction in flux is opposed by inducing a current that reinforces the original flux.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Inserting an iron rod increases the magnetic permeability within the coils, thereby enhancing the magnetic flux coupling between them. This greater flux linkage strengthens the induced EMF in the primary coil, leading to a larger deflection in the galvanometer. The iron rod acts as a magnetic core, concentrating the magnetic field lines and facilitating more effective mutual induction.",
    "explanation": "The introduction of an iron rod in the coils enhances the magnetic flux because iron is a ferromagnetic material with high permeability, which means it channels the magnetic field more effectively than air. This improved coupling increases the induced electromotive force as per Faraday's law, resulting in a more pronounced response on the galvanometer. This concept is a practical application of magnetic circuits and is used in many electromagnetic devices.",

Experiment 6.2 replaces the magnet with a current-carrying coil, yet still shows that moving one coil relative to another produces a similar induction effect. Both experiments emphasize the role of relative motion in changing the magnetic flux, but Experiment 6.2 also introduces the concept of mutual induction between two coils, where the current in one coil induces a current in another.",

This opposition requires that external work be performed, which is converted into thermal energy (via Joule heating) rather than spontaneous acceleration, thus upholding the conservation of energy.",
    "explanation": "A detailed explanation should include the role of Faraday's law in inducing emf due to a change in flux, and then connect Lenz's law by showing that the induced current creates a magnetic field opposing the flux increase.

This conversion of mechanical work into thermal energy via Joule heating is what upholds the conservation of energy in the system.",
    "explanation": "The answer should detail that when a magnet is moved, the induced current in the coil produces a magnetic field opposing the change in flux – according to Lenz’s law.

    "correct_answer": "The induced current in a loop depends on how the magnetic flux changes, which in turn is affected by both the shape and orientation of the loop. The area vector and its alignment with the magnetic field determine the initial flux. As the loop moves, the rate of change in flux is influenced by the geometry – for example, irregular shapes may experience variable flux change rates compared to regular ones. Lenz's law dictates that the induced current sets up a magnetic field opposing the flux change. Thus, loops with different shapes can experience different magnitudes and directions of induced current based on how quickly their effective area changes with respect to the field.",
    "explanation": "This answer should stress that the orientation (angle between the area vector and magnetic field) and the physical shape affecting the effective area are crucial. Faraday’s law (emf = -dΦ/dt) relates the rate of change of flux to the induced emf, while Lenz's law determines the direction.

    "question_text": "Analyze Experiment 6.3 and describe how pressing and releasing the tapping key in coil C2 leads to the induction of current in coil C1. Your answer should include the changes in current and magnetic flux.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Experiment 6.3, pressing the tapping key causes the current in coil C2 to rise rapidly from zero to a maximum, which in turn creates a rapidly increasing magnetic field. This results in an increase in the magnetic flux through the nearby coil C1, inducing an emf and a resulting current. When the key is held pressed, the current remains constant, so the flux is constant and the induced current drops to zero. Upon releasing the key, the current in coil C2 falls rapidly to zero, causing a rapid decrease in the magnetic flux and again inducing an emf in coil C1, which produces a current.",
    "explanation": "The process hinges on the fact that emf is induced only when there is a change in flux. A rapid change (either increase or decrease) in current in coil C2 causes a corresponding change in the magnetic field and flux through coil C1. Constant current does not change the flux, and therefore no emf is induced during that phase. This clearly demonstrates how transient changes in a circuit can induce measurable currents in nearby circuits.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Faraday's law is fundamental in designing devices like generators and transformers. For example, in generators, mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy by rotating coils in a magnetic field, creating a changing flux that induces an emf. In transformers, a changing flux in the primary coil induces a proportionally scaled emf in the secondary coil, depending on the ratio of turns. The advantages include efficient energy conversion and the ability to step up or step down voltage levels. Limitations include energy losses due to resistance and eddy currents, as well as the fact that the induced emf depends on time-varying conditions, which may require precise control.",
    "explanation": "Faraday's law underpins the operation of many electromagnetic devices. In generators, the law explains how motion in a magnetic field creates electricity, while in transformers, it provides the basis for voltage adjustments by altering coil turns. However, practical challenges such as resistive losses, heat generation, and non-ideal magnetic coupling impose limits on efficiency and performance.",
