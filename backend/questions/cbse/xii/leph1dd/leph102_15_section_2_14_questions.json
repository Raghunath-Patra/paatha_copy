    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a battery is connected to capacitors in series, initial charge imbalances cause current to flow until equilibrium is reached. The connecting wires are conductors, so any net charge would create an electric field that drives further redistribution. This continues until each capacitor has equal and opposite charges on its plates, resulting in no net charge on the connecting conductors. The final state is one where the sum of the voltage drops equals the battery voltage, and all internal electric fields within the conductors vanish.",
    "explanation": "This problem relies on the principle of conservation of charge and the behavior of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. Since charges cannot accumulate in the wires, any excess is neutralized until the electric field in the conductor is zero. The same magnitude of charge appears on each capacitor plate in series, ensuring that the battery’s connection produces the required summed voltage drop. This method of redistribution guarantees that the steady state is achieved with no unnecessary internal fields.",

    "correct_answer": "Combining capacitors in parallel increases the effective capacitance as the sum of the individual capacitances, allowing for greater charge storage at the same voltage. However, this configuration also means that if one capacitor fails, it can affect the overall performance. Also, due to manufacturing tolerances, individual capacitors might have slight differences in capacitance which can lead to uneven charge distribution and potential reliability issues in high-voltage applications.",
    "explanation": "Capacitors in parallel are used when a large capacitance is required, as the total capacitance is simply the sum of the capacitances. The equal voltage across each capacitor ensures that they contribute proportionally to the total charge storage. Limitations include the physical space required for multiple capacitors, potential reliability issues if one element fails, and the need to ensure similar voltage ratings and capacitance values to maintain uniform performance.",
