    "correct_answer": "The potential difference between two points is the work done per unit charge in moving a charge from one point to another. For a positive charge moving from a higher to a lower potential, the electric field does positive work and the potential energy decreases. For a negative charge, since the sign is reversed, moving to a higher potential can lead to a decrease in potential energy. For example, a positive charge moving from 50 V to -20 V experiences a potential difference of -70 V, meaning the electric field does work that converts potential energy into kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "The work done by the electric field on a charge is given by W_field = q(V_initial - V_final). For positive charges, moving from high to low potential results in a release of potential energy, while for negative charges the situation reverses. The external work required (if moving the charge against the field) is equal but opposite in sign to the work done by the field. This relationship shows how potential difference governs energy changes during charge movement.",
