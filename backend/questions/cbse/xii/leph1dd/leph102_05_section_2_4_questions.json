    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The potential V = (p cosθ)/(4πϵ0 r^2) explicitly depends on cosθ, which means it varies with the angle between the dipole moment p and the position vector r. This indicates that not only the magnitude of p matters but also its orientation relative to the observation point. When the observation point is rotated about the axis of the dipole, the angle θ remains constant, and hence the potential remains unchanged. Thus, the potential is axially symmetric about the dipole moment.",
    "explanation": "Since cosθ determines the contribution of the dipole moment in the potential expression, any change in the relative angle between p and r will alter the potential value.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For a single charge, the electric potential decays as 1/r, meaning it has a slower decay with distance. In contrast, the potential of an electric dipole decays as 1/r^2. This faster decay for a dipole implies that its influence diminishes more rapidly with distance compared to a monopole. In molecular interactions, the dipole-dipole interaction is short-ranged compared to monopole interactions, affecting how molecules attract or repel each other. In antenna design, the radiation patterns and the near-field to far-field transitions are influenced by these decay laws, impacting the efficiency and directionality of the antennas.",
    "explanation": "Understanding the different distance dependences helps in designing systems where either long-range (monopole) or short-range (dipole) interactions are desired.
