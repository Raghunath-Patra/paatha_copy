    "correct_answer": "The phasor method represents sinusoidal voltages and currents as rotating vectors in the complex plane. In resistor-only circuits, voltage and current phasors are aligned, indicating zero phase difference. In circuits with capacitors, the current leads the voltage by up to 90 degrees, and in circuits with inductors, the voltage leads the current by up to 90 degrees. This method simplifies the analysis by converting differential equations into algebraic equations using complex numbers.",
    "explanation": "By using phasors, one can replace time-dependent functions with static vectors, where the magnitude gives the peak value and the angle gives the phase. In resistors the in-phase relationship means both phasors align, whereas capacitors and inductors shift the phase by ±90°.

    "correct_answer": "The vertical projection of a rotating phasor, whose tip follows the circumference of a circle at a constant angular speed ω, is given by amplitude multiplied by sine of the angular displacement (i.e., vm sin ωt). This arises because the y-coordinate of a point on a unit circle is sin θ. Its importance lies in showing that the instantaneous value of ac voltage or current is a simple sine wave, which aids in analyzing circuit behavior in the time domain.",
    "explanation": "Consider a phasor with magnitude vm rotating with angular speed ω; its vertical component is vm sin ωt. This is a result of the definitions of sine and cosine in a circle.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The phasor rotates at a constant angular frequency ω, meaning its angular displacement increases linearly with time. The vertical projection of the phasor gives vm sin ωt, which is a sine function. The angular frequency ω determines the period and frequency of the sinusoidal waveform; higher ω means a more rapid oscillation. Thus, ω directly relates to how quickly the voltage and current vary in the circuit.",
    "explanation": "Since the phasor rotates uniformly at ω, every complete rotation corresponds to a 2π radian change, which defines the period of the sine wave. This relationship, v(t) = vm sin ωt, illustrates that the waveform's frequency is ω/2π and underpins the fundamental behavior of alternating current as observed in circuits.",
