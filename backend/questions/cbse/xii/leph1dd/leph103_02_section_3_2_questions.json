    "correct_answer": "The net current is determined by the difference between the forward flow of positive charges and the forward flow of negative charges, represented by q = q+ - q-. This analytical approach recognizes that both types of charges contribute differently to the overall current. Understanding their individual directions and magnitudes helps in accurately calculating the net current and predicting directionality. It also accounts for complex charge interactions in non-steady currents, ultimately ensuring that the theoretical definitions align with the observed electrical behavior in various systems.",
    "explanation": "The conventional definition of current takes into account the fact that in a conductor, both positive and negative charges may contribute to the charge flow. By subtracting the negative charge contribution from the positive, we correctly represent the net effect. This nuanced understanding is essential for proper circuit analysis and for the design of devices where charge distribution may vary over time.
