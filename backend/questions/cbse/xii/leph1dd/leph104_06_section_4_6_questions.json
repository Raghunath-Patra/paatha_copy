    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ampere's circuital law simplifies the calculation of the magnetic field around a long straight current-carrying wire because the field exhibits cylindrical symmetry. By selecting a circular Amperian loop centered on the wire, the magnetic field is constant in magnitude and tangential to the loop at every point. This reduces the line integral ∮ B · dl to B multiplied by the circumference (2πr), from which the equation B × 2πr = µ₀ I is derived, leading to B = µ₀ I/(2πr).",
    "explanation": "The cylindrical symmetry ensures that the magnetic field has the same magnitude at every point on the loop and that its direction is tangential.

    "correct_answer": "For a straight current-carrying wire, the right-hand rule is applied by pointing the thumb in the direction of the current and curling the fingers, which then indicate the circular direction of the magnetic field around the wire. In contrast, for a current loop, a separate version of the right-hand rule is used where the fingers follow the direction of the loop’s current; the thumb then points along the axis of the loop, indicating the direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "explanation": "Although both applications use the right-hand rule, the roles of the thumb and fingers change depending on whether the focus is on the field around a wire or the axial field of a loop. In the straight wire case, the fingers directly trace the field lines; in the current loop case, the thumb direction is critical for establishing the field direction along the axis.",

    "correct_answer": "Ampere's circuital law is most effective in situations with high symmetry, such as infinite wires, solenoids, or toroids, where the magnetic field is uniform along segments of an Amperian loop. In asymmetrical or irregular current distributions, it becomes challenging to choose an Amperian loop such that the magnetic field is constant or zero over parts of the loop. Consequently, the integration may not simplify easily, and Ampere's law may not directly yield a simple expression for the magnetic field.",
    "explanation": "While Ampere's law is universally true, its utility lies in the simplification provided by symmetry.
