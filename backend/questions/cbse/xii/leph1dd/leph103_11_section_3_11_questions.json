However, note that if the load voltage is forced to be 4.5 V, the actual current distribution will be such that the stronger cell (cell 1) supplies current and cell 2 might absorb current, leading to circulating currents. Alternatively, if both cells supply current to meet the load, one solves the combined equations: Using the formulas for parallel combination, 1/req = 1/1 + 1/2 = 1.5 so req ≈ 0.67 Ω and εeq calculated by (ε1/r1 + ε2/r2)/ (1/r1 + 1/r2) = ((5/1)+(4/2))/(1+0.5) = (5+2)/1.5 = 7/1.5 ≈ 4.67 V.
