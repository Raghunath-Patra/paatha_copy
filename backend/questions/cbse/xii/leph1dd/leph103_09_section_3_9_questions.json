    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "As charges move from a higher potential to a lower potential, they ideally lose potential energy equal to ΔU = - I × V × t, which would increase their kinetic energy. However, due to frequent collisions with the atoms and ions in the conductor, the kinetic energy is transferred to the material in the form of thermal energy, causing the conductor to heat up. The total energy is conserved because the loss in electrical potential energy is balanced by the gain in thermal energy.",
    "explanation": "This process demonstrates the conservation of energy principle. While the ideal scenario would lead to continuous acceleration of charge carriers, in real conductors, collisions result in energy being dissipated as heat. This accounts for the observed steady drift velocity of charge carriers and the heating of the conductor.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "High voltage power transmission reduces losses because it allows the same power to be delivered at a lower current, thus reducing I²R losses in the transmission cables. However, high voltage poses significant safety hazards such as the risk of electrical shock and arcing. To mitigate these hazards, power lines are kept away from populated areas and insulated properly, and transformers are used to step down the voltage before distribution to consumers.",
    "explanation": "By raising the transmission voltage, the current decreases for a fixed power level (P = I × V). This reduction in current drastically reduces ohmic losses since power loss in the cables is proportional to the square of the current (I²R). Despite these benefits, high voltage systems require stringent safety protocols including insulation, proper spacing, and safety signs to alert the public of the high voltage risks.",

    "correct_answer": "In a DC circuit, energy conservation is maintained by ensuring that the chemical energy supplied by the external power source is completely accounted for as electrical energy, which is then converted into thermal energy due to ohmic losses in the resistive loads. While ideally, the decrease in electrical potential energy (ΔU = - I × V × t) would be converted into kinetic energy of the charge carriers, in practice, collisions cause this energy to be transferred to the lattice of the conductor as heat. This thorough energy transformation process, from chemical to electrical to thermal energy, upholds the law of conservation of energy.",
    "explanation": "The external power source (e.g., a battery or cell) provides the necessary energy to overcome resistive losses. The Ohm's law relationship and the power formulas (P = I × V, P = I²R, and P = V²/R) illustrate how energy is distributed and lost as heat. The entire process is an excellent demonstration of energy conservation where energy is neither lost nor created but transformed from one form to another, with the total energy remaining constant.",
