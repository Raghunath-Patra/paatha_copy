    "correct_answer": "The magnetic core enhances the magnetic field inside the solenoid by adding an additional field contribution from the material's magnetisation, M. The core material becomes magnetised in response to the applied magnetic intensity H produced by the solenoid's current, and this magnetisation creates its own magnetic field Bₘ equal to μ₀ M.

The magnetising current Iₘ is defined as the extra current that would be needed in the solenoid to produce the same magnetic field in the absence of the core.

This opposition results in a decrease in the net magnetic field within the material, and the negative sign of χ indicates that the induced magnetisation is in the opposite direction to the magnetic intensity H.",
    "explanation": "The concept of diamagnetism is based on the fact that the induced microscopic currents in a diamagnetic material create a magnetic moment that opposes the external field, as described by Lenz's Law.

First, μ₀ n = 4π x 10^-7 x 1000 = 4π x 10^-4 ≈ 0.0012566. Then, μ_r μ₀ n = 400 x 0.0012566 = 0.50264. So, 1.0 = 0.50264 (I + Iₘ) hence I + Iₘ = 1/0.50264 ≈ 1.99 x 10^0 which approximates to 2 A? However, referring to the example in the section, the calculated Iₘ is given as 794 A. On reviewing, the example uses a different approach where B = μ_r n (I + Iₘ) leads to Iₘ determined by comparing the field due to the core and that from the winding current.
