    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a dielectric slab of thickness less than the plate separation is inserted, the capacitor effectively behaves as two capacitors in series: one part with dielectric and the other without. In Example 2.8, the slab has thickness (3/4)d and vacuum occupies (1/4)d. The electric fields in these two regions differ: E in the dielectric is E0/K while in vacuum it remains E0. The overall potential difference becomes V = E0*(1/4)d + (E0/K)*(3/4)d. Since the free charge on the plates remains constant, the capacitance increases relative to C0 by the factor (4K)/(K+3).",
    "explanation": "The explanation uses the concept of series capacitors. The effective voltage drop across the capacitor accounts for different fields in the dielectric and vacuum regions.

The resulting field between the plates becomes E = sigma / (epsilon0 * K), and the potential difference is V = E * d = sigma * d / (epsilon0 * K). Since Q = sigma * A remains unchanged, the new capacitance is C = Q / V = (epsilon0 * K * A) / d.",

    "correct_answer": "Dielectric polarization occurs when an external electric field induces dipole moments within the material. This polarization creates bound surface charges that oppose the free charges on the capacitor plates. Consequently, the effective electric field inside the dielectric is reduced by a factor of K, such that E = E0 / K. With the reduced field, the potential difference for the same free charge distribution decreases, leading to an increase in capacitance (C = Q/V). This increase in capacitance is quantified by the relation C = K * C0, where C0 is the capacitance in vacuum.",
    "explanation": "The answer elaborates on the physical process of dielectric polarization. By creating opposing surface charges, the dielectric lessens the net field, thereby reducing the voltage drop across the plates.
