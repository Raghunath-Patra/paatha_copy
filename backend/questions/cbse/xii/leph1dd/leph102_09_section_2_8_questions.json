Next, for charge q2, the work includes both the work done against the external field, q2V(r2), and the work done against the field due to q1, given by (q1q2)/(4πε0r12).

    "correct_answer": "The work done by an external torque in rotating a dipole from an initial angle θ0 to a final angle θ1 in a uniform external field is given by W = ∫ from θ0 to θ1 of pE sinθ dθ, which evaluates to pE(cosθ0 - cosθ1). By choosing the reference angle where the potential energy is zero (commonly θ0 = π/2), the potential energy associated with the dipole at any angle θ becomes U(θ) = -pE cosθ. This shows that the work done in reorienting the dipole is stored as its potential energy.",

    "correct_answer": "Choosing a reference point in defining potential energy is crucial because potential energy is only determined up to an arbitrary constant.
