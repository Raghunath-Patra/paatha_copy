    "correct_answer": "In a conductor, when charge is applied, it redistributes itself evenly over the entire surface due to the free movement of electrons. For example, a metal sphere quickly spreads out any extra charge uniformly. In contrast, in an insulator, charge remains localized because the electrons are not free to move. For instance, if you charge a plastic rod, the charge stays exactly where it was applied.",
    "explanation": "This answer tackles the core difference: the mobility of free electrons in conductors versus the lack of such mobility in insulators. In metals, electron delocalization ensures uniform distribution, while insulators do not allow such movement. Examples such as a metal sphere and a plastic rod help illustrate these concepts.",

The metal rod serves as a pathway for the charge to reach the leaves, while the leaves visually demonstrate the presence of charge due to their repulsion.",
    "explanation": "A detailed explanation includes the method of charge transfer via the metal rod and the resulting repulsion between the similarly charged gold leaves.

    "correct_answer": "Charging by friction occurs when two different materials are rubbed together, causing electrons to transfer from one to the other. With a plastic comb, the material is an insulator and retains the acquired charge at the point of contact. In contrast, metallic objects are conductors; any charge generated by friction spreads quickly over the entire surface and often discharges to the ground, thus making the charging process less noticeable.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines the differences in electron mobility in insulators and conductors. In the case of the plastic comb, the insulating properties allow the charge to remain localized, while in metal, the free movement of electrons results in rapid charge distribution and dissipation.",
