Setting this equal to zero for x between the charges gives 5/(x) = 3/(16 - x), which leads to x = 10 cm.

The work required to move a unit charge against this field is the potential difference V.

In capacitor design, it limits the maximum potential difference that can be applied between the conductors. If the field exceeds this limit, the dielectric may ionize, leading to charge leakage. Therefore, to store a large charge without breakdown, a capacitor must have a high capacitance so that the charge required produces only a low potential difference, keeping the electric field below the dielectric's breakdown threshold.",
    "explanation": "A dielectric's strength determines the maximum electric field permissible without causing breakdown. Since V = Q/C, a larger capacitance results in a smaller potential difference for the same charge.

Additionally, employing materials with higher dielectric constants can further enhance capacitance, allowing for significant charge storage at lower voltages.",
    "explanation": "High electric fields can ionize the surrounding medium (for example, air), causing leakage of charge from the capacitor plates. To mitigate this, it is crucial to design capacitors that allow high charge storage at low potential differences, which can be achieved through larger plate areas, closer plate spacing, and improved dielectric materials.

With two capacitors, the total energy becomes half of the initial energy, resulting in 5 µJ, with the rest lost due to transient effects such as resistive heating and radiation.",

    "correct_answer": "Electrostatic potential is defined as the work done per unit positive test charge by an external force in bringing it from infinity to a specified point. It is significant because it provides a measure of potential energy that is independent of the magnitude of the test charge and characterizes the electric field created by a charge configuration.",

    "correct_answer": "To derive the expression, first consider an infinitesimal test charge dq. The work done by an external force to move this charge from infinity to a point P in an electric field is dW. By definition, the work done per unit charge is dW/dq, which defines the potential V at point P. Since the force experienced by the test charge is qE and the work done (against the field) is integrated over a path, for a unit charge the potential difference between two points (say infinity and P) is V_P - V_infinity. With V_infinity chosen as zero, we obtain V_P = work done per unit charge. This derivation demonstrates that electrostatic potential is an intrinsic property of the electric field.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts with the notion of work done on a small test charge and then divides out the test charge to get a property characteristic of the field itself.

    "correct_answer": "Electrostatic potential, by definition, gives the work done per unit charge in moving a test charge from a reference point (usually infinity) to a particular location in an electric field. Since this work is independent of the path taken, it confirms that electrostatic forces are conservative. For instance, whether a test charge is moved along a curved or straight-line path between two points, the work done remains the same, which is a hallmark of conservative forces. This property is crucial in energy conservation, allowing us to define potential energy functions. An example includes the work done in moving a charge in the field of a point charge, where the potential depends only on the radial distance, regardless of the path taken.",
    "explanation": "The concept of electrostatic potential encapsulates the conservative nature of electrostatic forces by reducing the work done to a function solely of the initial and final positions. This enables the assignment of a scalar potential energy to every point in the field, thereby simplifying problems in electromagnetism and confirming that the field is conservative because the net work over any closed path is zero.",

Assume that the potential difference between two points separated by a fixed distance in Region A is 10 V and in Region B is 30 V. The problem demonstrates that the magnitude of the electric field (and hence the density of field lines) is directly related to the potential difference, given by E = ΔV/Δr. Thus, Region B, with a higher potential difference for the same distance, exhibits a stronger electric field. This analysis can be used to derive that if the density of field lines triples, the potential gradient—and therefore the electric field strength—triples as well.",
    "explanation": "The problem correlates the qualitative observation (denser field lines indicate a higher field strength) with the quantitative relationship E = ΔV/Δr.

    "correct_answer": "The conservative nature of the electrostatic force implies that the work done in moving a charge between two points is independent of the path taken. This means that the total work required to assemble a configuration of charges depends solely on the final arrangement rather than the sequence of steps taken.",
    "explanation": "Because the electrostatic force is conservative, any work done against this force (or work done by the field) is stored as potential energy. This property simplifies calculations because it allows using the concept of potential energy, which is defined for the final configuration without considering how the charges were brought together. It also means that if the configuration is disassembled, the same amount of work (in magnitude) is recovered, thus ensuring energy conservation in electrostatic processes.",

    "explanation": "This process starts at the molecular level where disruption of charge symmetry occurs upon application of the field. In the interior, the close proximity of opposite charges cancels any net charge, but at the boundaries the lack of neighboring molecules allows the dipole charges to appear as surface charges. These bound surface charges then generate an internal field that opposes the external field.",

    "correct_answer": "Non-polar molecules, such as O₂ or H₂, have symmetrical charge distributions and thus no permanent dipole moment. When placed in an external field, these molecules are polarized by a slight displacement of their electron clouds, inducing a dipole moment proportional to the field. In contrast, polar molecules, such as H₂O or HCl, already possess a permanent dipole moment due to an uneven charge distribution. At zero field, the orientations of these dipoles are random due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net polarization. However, when an external field is applied, the dipoles tend to align with the field, and the net effect is a significant polarization of the dielectric.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the origin of the dipole moments. For non-polar molecules, the dipole is entirely induced by the field, while for polar molecules, the field aligns pre-existing dipoles. Examples include oxygen (non-polar, with induced dipoles) versus water (polar, with permanent dipoles that align).",

The connecting wires are conductors, so any net charge would create an electric field that drives further redistribution.

The final state is one where the sum of the voltage drops equals the battery voltage, and all internal electric fields within the conductors vanish.",
    "explanation": "This problem relies on the principle of conservation of charge and the behavior of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. Since charges cannot accumulate in the wires, any excess is neutralized until the electric field in the conductor is zero. The same magnitude of charge appears on each capacitor plate in series, ensuring that the battery’s connection produces the required summed voltage drop.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The potential difference between two points is the work done per unit charge in moving a charge from one point to another. For a positive charge moving from a higher to a lower potential, the electric field does positive work and the potential energy decreases. For a negative charge, since the sign is reversed, moving to a higher potential can lead to a decrease in potential energy. For example, a positive charge moving from 50 V to -20 V experiences a potential difference of -70 V, meaning the electric field does work that converts potential energy into kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "The work done by the electric field on a charge is given by W_field = q(V_initial - V_final). For positive charges, moving from high to low potential results in a release of potential energy, while for negative charges the situation reverses. The external work required (if moving the charge against the field) is equal but opposite in sign to the work done by the field. This relationship shows how potential difference governs energy changes during charge movement.",
