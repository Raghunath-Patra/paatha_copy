    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a coil rotates in a uniform magnetic field, the effective area exposed to the field changes as A cos θ, where θ = ωt. This change in area causes the magnetic flux through the coil to vary sinusoidally with time. According to Faraday's Law, a changing magnetic flux induces an emf. Mathematically, the induced emf is given by ε = NBAω sin ωt, showing that it alternates as the sine function varies between positive and negative values over one complete rotation.",
    "explanation": "The rotation of the coil causes its orientation relative to the magnetic field to change with time, affecting the effective area that intercepts the magnetic field lines. The change in the magnetic flux through the coil, given by ΦB = BA cos ωt, when differentiated with respect to time yields a sine function (ε = NBAω sin ωt) according to Faraday's Law. This sinusoidal variation results in an alternating emf that periodically reverses polarity.",

    "correct_answer": "The maximum voltage, defined as ε₀, is reached when sin ωt equals 1 or -1, which occurs when ωt is π/2, 3π/2, etc. Under these conditions, the coil's orientation relative to the magnetic field changes most rapidly, resulting in the greatest rate of change of magnetic flux and thereby the maximum induced emf.",
    "explanation": "In the equation ε = ε₀ sin ωt, ε₀ represents the peak value of the emf. The sine function has a maximum absolute value of 1. Thus, the maximum voltage is achieved when sin ωt = ±1, which corresponds to angles where the coil is at 90° or 270° relative to the magnetic field. This is when the projection of the area perpendicular to the field changes most rapidly, maximizing the rate of change of flux and inducing the highest emf.",

    "correct_answer": "Rotating the electromagnets rather than the coils can simplify the electrical connections by eliminating the need for slip rings. However, it might lead to practical challenges in maintaining uniform magnetic fields and may affect the generator's efficiency and stability. Detailed design considerations and trade-offs must be examined in context.",
    "explanation": "When designing a generator, rotating the electromagnets instead of the coils can offer advantages such as simpler wiring since the coils remain stationary. On the downside, it may be more challenging to ensure a consistent and uniform magnetic field, which is essential for efficient emf induction. Additionally, energy losses and mechanical stresses in the rotating parts must be carefully evaluated. Thus, while the approach may reduce certain complexities, it introduces new design challenges that must be balanced.",
