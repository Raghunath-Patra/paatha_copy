    "explanation": "Gauss's law for magnetism is fundamental because it establishes that magnetic field lines do not start or end at any point, reinforcing the experimental evidence that magnetic monopoles have not been observed.

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A freely suspended bar magnet aligns itself in the direction of the external magnetic field. The north pole of the magnet points toward the geographic north because it experiences a force that aligns it with the field lines. The magnetic field lines, which emerge from the north pole and enter the south pole, exert torque on the magnet, causing it to rotate until equilibrium is reached.",
    "explanation": "The explanation involves understanding that external magnetic fields exert a torque on the bar magnet. This is due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the bar magnet and the external magnetic field. The forces align the magnet along the magnetic field lines, which are defined as continuous loops from the north to the south pole. Such analysis helps in visualizing how field lines and magnetic moments interact in real physical systems.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The statement is true because according to the text, when a bar magnet is broken into two pieces, each piece becomes a smaller bar magnet with both north and south poles. This occurs since magnetic monopoles do not exist, and the magnetic field lines always form closed loops.",
    "explanation": "This evaluation is based on experimental evidence and the theoretical understanding of magnetism. The non-existence of magnetic monopoles is a key principle, meaning that any division of a magnet results in each fragment still displaying both poles. Gauss's law for magnetism further supports this by stating that the net magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero.
