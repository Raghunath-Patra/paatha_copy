    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Resistor = 17 Ω; Terminal Voltage = 8.5 V",
    "explanation": "In a series circuit the total emf is divided between the internal resistance and the external resistor. The voltage drop across the internal resistance is I × r = 0.5 A × 3 Ω = 1.5 V, so the terminal voltage is 10 V – 1.5 V = 8.5 V. The resistor’s value is then given by R = terminal voltage / current = 8.5 V / 0.5 A = 17 Ω.",

Using R = R0 [1 + α (T – T0)], the temperature rise is (82.14 – 71.88) Ω / (71.88 Ω × 1.70×10^-4 °C^-1) ≈ 840 °C.

    "explanation": "By applying Kirchhoff's junction and loop rules to the bridge circuit and taking advantage of the symmetry (or balanced condition) in the network, the current through the cross-arm (bridge resistor) is zero. The remaining current divides between the other two branches according to their resistances. Detailed circuit analysis shows that the series current is approximately 1.0 A, splitting into about 0.6 A and 0.4 A in the two parallel branches.",
