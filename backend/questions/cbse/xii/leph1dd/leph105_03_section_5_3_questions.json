    "correct_answer": "Gauss's law for magnetism states that the net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero, whereas Gauss's law for electrostatics states that the net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge (q/ε₀). The key difference is that electric charges act as sources or sinks for electric fields, while magnetic fields do not have analogous point sources. This is because magnetic poles always come in north-south pairs, meaning isolated magnetic monopoles have not been observed.",
    "explanation": "The absence of magnetic monopoles means that every magnetic field line that enters a closed surface must exit it, resulting in zero net flux. In contrast, an enclosed net electric charge results in a nonzero net electric flux.

    "correct_answer": "Some diagrams correctly depict magnetic fields by showing closed loops that enclose regions with a current (such as the diagram of a wire or toroid), while others incorrectly show field lines emanating from a point or crossing each other. Incorrect depictions, such as field lines originating or terminating at a point, violate Gauss's law for magnetism which requires the net flux to be zero. Additionally, field lines that cross imply multiple directions for the field at one point, contradicting the unique vector nature of the magnetic field.",
    "explanation": "Correct diagrams, like those representing a toroid or properly drawn solenoid, ensure that field lines are continuous and enclose the current-carrying region, satisfying Ampere's law and Gauss's law for magnetism.

    "correct_answer": "The statement is false. A current element does not exert a force on itself because the magnetic field generated by that element does not act back upon it. However, different elements of the same wire, when separated by a distance, can exert forces on each other through their respective magnetic fields. In the special case of a straight wire, the net internal forces cancel out.",
    "explanation": "According to electromagnetic theory, self-interaction that would lead to a net force or torque on an element from its own field is not permitted.
