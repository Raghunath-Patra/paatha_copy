    "explanation": "In purely reactive components like inductors or capacitors, the phase difference between voltage and current is π/2, leading to a cosine term of zero (cos 90° = 0) in the power calculation. This means that no real (average) power is dissipated over a cycle.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A capacitor can improve the power factor by providing a leading reactive current that cancels out a portion of the lagging reactive current from an inductive load. In a phasor diagram, the total current is resolved into a component in phase with the voltage (which does real work) and a perpendicular reactive component (which does not consume power). By adding a capacitor, the reactive component is reduced, moving the overall current vector closer to the voltage vector. This results in a smaller phase angle φ and an increased cos φ, thereby improving the power factor.",
    "explanation": "In circuits with inductive loads, the current lags behind the voltage, manifesting as a reactive component (Iq) perpendicular to the applied voltage. Connecting a capacitor generates an equal and opposite reactive current (Ic) that subtracts from Iq. The resultant current thus has a larger portion (Ip) that is in phase with the voltage. The phasor diagram demonstrates this cancellation, where the overall current vector tilts toward the voltage vector, reducing φ and enhancing the power factor (cos φ).",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A metal detector contains a coil connected to a capacitor forming an LC circuit tuned to resonate at a specific frequency. When a person carrying metal passes through the detector, the metal perturbs the magnetic field, thereby changing the effective inductance of the coil. This detunes the circuit from its resonant frequency, causing a significant change in current. The change in current is detected by the electronic circuitry, which then triggers an alarm.",
    "explanation": "Metal detectors exploit the sensitivity of LC circuits at resonance. At resonance, the impedance is minimized and the current is maximized. When metal is introduced into the coil, its magnetic properties alter the inductance, shifting the resonance condition. This shift leads to a measurable change in the circuit’s current. The detection system senses this deviation from the expected resonant behavior and activates an audible signal to alert security personnel.",
