    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The potential energy arises due to the work done by an external force that moves a charge slowly from one point to another against the electrostatic repulsive force. Since the charge is moved without acceleration, all the work done is stored as potential energy. When the external force is removed, the stored potential energy transforms into kinetic energy, maintaining the conservation of energy.",
    "explanation": "The process involves applying an external force that exactly cancels the electric force, ensuring that the charge moves with an infinitesimally slow constant speed. The work performed in this process increases the charge's potential energy. Later, if the force is released, this stored energy is converted to kinetic energy as the charge accelerates. This phenomenon is a direct example of energy conservation in a conservative field.",

    "correct_answer": "Both gravitational and electrostatic forces obey inverse square laws and are conservative, meaning the work done depends only on the initial and final positions. Gravitational potential energy involves masses while electrostatic potential energy involves charges. The main difference lies in the proportionality constants and the nature of the interacting entities, yet both systems allow only potential energy differences to have physical significance.",
    "explanation": "Gravitational and electrostatic fields share similar mathematical forms because both depend on 1/r^2, leading to similar integration techniques for work done. However, the constants (gravitational constant versus Coulomb's constant) and the interacting properties (mass versus charge) differ. In practice, these similarities ensure that energy conservation applies similarly in both cases, even though the physical forces act on different types of particles.",
