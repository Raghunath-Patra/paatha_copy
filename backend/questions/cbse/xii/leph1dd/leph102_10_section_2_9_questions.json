    "correct_answer": "The electric field is zero inside a conductor because free electrons move in response to any external field. They redistribute until the internal field is canceled. Gauss's law supports this result by showing that any closed surface inside the conductor encloses no net charge, leading to zero electric flux and hence zero field.",
    "explanation": "Under static conditions, free electrons in a conductor move to neutralize any applied field. When a Gaussian surface is drawn inside the conductor, the electric flux through it is zero due to the cancellation of internal fields, indicating no net charge present within that surface.

    "explanation": "If the electric field had a tangential component at the surface, it would exert a force on free charges, causing them to move and alter the distribution. The requirement for the field to be normal ensures that no lateral forces act on the charges, hence maintaining a static and balanced charge distribution on the surface.

A robust design could involve enclosing the instrument in a hollow metallic conductor (a Faraday cage) that evenly distributes any external charges, thereby nullifying internal fields.",
    "explanation": "Because free charges in a conductor rearrange to cancel external electric fields, sensitive instruments placed inside a hollow metallic enclosure are protected from these fields.
