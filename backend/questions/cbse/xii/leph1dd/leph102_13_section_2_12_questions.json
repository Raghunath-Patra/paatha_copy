    "explanation": "The derivation uses the infinite plane sheet approximation where the field from one plate is σ/(2ε₀). Since the fields from both plates add in the gap, the resultant field is E = σ/ε₀. The potential difference is then obtained by integrating this field over the distance d, leading to V = (σd)/(ε₀).

However, in practical capacitors with finite size, edge effects (or fringing) result in non-uniform fields near the boundaries.
