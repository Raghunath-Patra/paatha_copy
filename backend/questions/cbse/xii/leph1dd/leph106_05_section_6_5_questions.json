    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Lenz's law states that the direction of induced current is such that its own magnetic field opposes the change in the magnetic field that produced it. As a bar magnet approaches a conductive coil, the increasing magnetic flux induces a current that creates a magnetic field opposing the magnet's approach. This opposition requires that external work be performed, which is converted into thermal energy (via Joule heating) rather than spontaneous acceleration, thus upholding the conservation of energy.",
    "explanation": "A detailed explanation should include the role of Faraday's law in inducing emf due to a change in flux, and then connect Lenz's law by showing that the induced current creates a magnetic field opposing the flux increase. This opposition means that work must be done to move the magnet, and the energy from this work is dissipated as heat.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Joule heating plays a critical role in dissipating the energy transferred when work is done to move a magnet relative to a coil. As the magnet approaches or recedes from the coil, an induced emf drives a current through the coil. Due to the resistance in the coil, this current results in energy loss in the form of heat. This conversion of mechanical work into thermal energy via Joule heating is what upholds the conservation of energy in the system.",
    "explanation": "The answer should detail that when a magnet is moved, the induced current in the coil produces a magnetic field opposing the change in flux – according to Lenz’s law. Overcoming this opposition requires mechanical work, which is not stored but instead dissipated as heat in the coil's resistance (Joule heating).

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The induced current in a loop depends on how the magnetic flux changes, which in turn is affected by both the shape and orientation of the loop. The area vector and its alignment with the magnetic field determine the initial flux. As the loop moves, the rate of change in flux is influenced by the geometry – for example, irregular shapes may experience variable flux change rates compared to regular ones. Lenz's law dictates that the induced current sets up a magnetic field opposing the flux change. Thus, loops with different shapes can experience different magnitudes and directions of induced current based on how quickly their effective area changes with respect to the field.",
    "explanation": "This answer should stress that the orientation (angle between the area vector and magnetic field) and the physical shape affecting the effective area are crucial. Faraday’s law (emf = -dΦ/dt) relates the rate of change of flux to the induced emf, while Lenz's law determines the direction. Variations in loop shape lead to differences in the change rate of flux, thus affecting both the magnitude and direction of the induced current.",
