    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The potential is zero at 10 cm from the positive charge (between the charges) and at 40 cm from the positive charge (beyond the negative charge).",
    "explanation": "Assume the positive charge is at x = 0 and the negative at x = 16 cm. For a point at distance x from the positive charge, the net potential is k[5×10⁻⁸/x – 3×10⁻⁸/(16 - x)]. Setting this equal to zero for x between the charges gives 5/(x) = 3/(16 - x), which leads to x = 10 cm. Considering a point on the right of the negative charge, the equation becomes 5/(x) = 3/(x - 16), solving to give x = 40 cm.",

    "correct_answer": "The potential at the centre is 2.7 × 10⁹ V.",
    "explanation": "In a regular hexagon, the distance from the centre to any vertex equals the side length, 0.1 m. The potential due to one charge is kq/R, where k = 9 × 10⁹ Nm²/C² and q = 5 × 10⁻³ C. Thus, V_single = (9×10⁹ × 5×10⁻³)/0.1 = 4.5×10⁸ V.

    "explanation": "For equal and opposite charges separated by 6 cm, the potential is zero along the perpendicular bisector.

    "explanation": "When a dielectric is inserted while the capacitor is connected to a constant voltage source, the effective capacitance increases.

    "correct_answer": "Approximately 6 × 10⁻⁶ J of energy is lost.",
    "explanation": "Initially, the energy stored in the 600 pF capacitor is U_initial = 0.5 × 600×10⁻¹² × (200)² = 0.5 × 600×10⁻¹² × 40000 = 12×10⁻⁶ J. After connection, the two capacitors (total capacitance 1200 pF) share the charge equally, giving a final voltage of 100 V. The final energy is U_final = 0.5 × 1200×10⁻¹² × (100)² = 6×10⁻⁶ J.
