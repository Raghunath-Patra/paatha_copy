    "explanation": "When the magnet is approached, the magnetic flux through the coil increases, inducing a current in one direction.

    "correct_answer": "Inserting an iron rod increases the magnetic permeability within the coils, thereby enhancing the magnetic flux coupling between them. This greater flux linkage strengthens the induced EMF in the primary coil, leading to a larger deflection in the galvanometer. The iron rod acts as a magnetic core, concentrating the magnetic field lines and facilitating more effective mutual induction.",
    "explanation": "The introduction of an iron rod in the coils enhances the magnetic flux because iron is a ferromagnetic material with high permeability, which means it channels the magnetic field more effectively than air. This improved coupling increases the induced electromotive force as per Faraday's law, resulting in a more pronounced response on the galvanometer.

    "correct_answer": "Experiment 6.1 involves a stationary coil and a magnet that is moved either towards or away from it, demonstrating that a change in magnetic flux due to motion results in an induced current. Experiment 6.2 replaces the magnet with a current-carrying coil, yet still shows that moving one coil relative to another produces a similar induction effect. Both experiments emphasize the role of relative motion in changing the magnetic flux, but Experiment 6.2 also introduces the concept of mutual induction between two coils, where the current in one coil induces a current in another.",
