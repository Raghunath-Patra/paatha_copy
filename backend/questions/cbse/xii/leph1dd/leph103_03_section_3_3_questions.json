    "correct_answer": "A battery or cell maintains a steady electric field by continuously supplying charge to the conductor, thus preventing the neutralization of the applied charges and ensuring a constant drift velocity of electrons.",
    "explanation": "When a battery is connected to a conductor, it creates a constant potential difference between the ends of the conductor. This potential difference generates a steady electric field within the conductor. The field continuously exerts a force on the free electrons, causing them to accelerate and then scatter off ions, which creates a uniform drift velocity. Because the battery replenishes the charges that are neutralized by the moving electrons, the electric field remains steady, and a continuous current is sustained. This mechanism is fundamental to direct current circuits.",

    "explanation": "In metals, the conduction electrons are not bound to any particular atom and can move freely in response to an electric field, whereas the positive ions remain fixed in a lattice structure. In contrast, electrolytic solutions contain ions that are dissolved in a solvent; here, both cations and anions are free to move, each responding to the electric field according to their charge.

Initially, measure the current with no applied field to confirm no net movement. Then, apply the charges to create an electric field and observe the transient current as electrons drift to neutralize the imposed charges. Finally, monitor the current reduction as neutralization progresses. Measurement devices like ammeters and oscilloscopes would track the current flow over time.",
    "explanation": "A suitable experiment would start with a cylindrical metal conductor and attach two thin circular discs (electrodes) at its ends. By first ensuring that no external charge is applied, one can verify that the random thermal motion results in no net current. Then, applying a positive charge to one electrode and an equivalent negative charge to the other creates an electric field inside the conductor. As electrons begin drifting towards the positive electrode to neutralize the charges, a transient current will be observed. The current will decrease as the charges are neutralized. Instruments like ammeters should be connected in series to record the current, while an oscilloscope might capture the transient behavior. This setup clearly demonstrates the effect of an applied electric field and the importance of continuous charge replenishment for sustained current.",
