When a person comes into contact with a conductive object, the accumulated charge may discharge in the form of a spark or shock. In everyday situations, such as opening a car door, this discharge can cause a noticeable shock.",
    "explanation": "When two insulating materials are rubbed together, electrons may transfer from one material to the other, creating a net positive and negative charge on each. This charge separation remains until a conductive path allows the charges to neutralize. In the case of a car door, the human body, having accumulated charges, discharges its static electricity upon touching the conductive metal, producing a spark or a shock. This event is governed by the principles of electrostatics, which include the behavior of static charges and their discharge.",

    "correct_answer": "Friction causes the transfer of electrons between insulating materials and thereby creates a static charge imbalance. An experimental method could involve using a Faraday pail connected to an electrometer to measure the charge accumulated on a surface after rubbing two materials together.",
    "explanation": "Friction between two materials, especially insulators, leads to electron transfer, causing one to become negatively charged and the other positively charged. To measure this, a Faraday pail, which is sensitive to static charge, can be used. The insulating material is rubbed against another surface and then brought into or near the pail without direct contact (or with controlled contact) while an electrometer records the charge transferred. This method allows quantitative analysis of static charge accumulation and provides insight into the efficiency of different materials in charge storage.",
