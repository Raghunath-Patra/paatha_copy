    "correct_answer": "A transformer operates by using an alternating current in the primary coil to create a changing magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic core. This flux links with the secondary coil, where it induces an electromotive force (emf) according to Faraday's law of induction. In an ideal transformer, the back emf in the primary counters the applied voltage, and the voltage ratio between the secondary and primary is given by the turns ratio (Vₛ/Vₚ = Nₛ/Nₚ). Conservation of power (ignoring losses) implies that the current ratio is the inverse of the turns ratio (Iₛ/Iₚ = Nₚ/Nₛ), so stepping up the voltage results in stepping down the current, and vice versa.",
    "explanation": "This answer discusses the operation starting with the alternating current in the primary coil, the resulting magnetic flux in the core, and how that flux induces an emf in the secondary coil.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the coils are wound on top of each other on a single limb, the flux produced by the primary coil is more effectively linked to the secondary coil, which reduces flux leakage and improves efficiency. In contrast, when the coils are wound on separate limbs, there is a greater chance for some magnetic flux to escape without linking both coils, thereby reducing efficiency. The overlapping configuration is generally preferred for better magnetic coupling and transformer performance.",
    "explanation": "This answer requires analyzing the physical arrangement of transformer windings. The overlapping configuration ensures tighter coupling and minimized leakage, while separate limbs may lead to reduced flux linkage.

    "correct_answer": "Step-up transformers are used to increase the voltage from generators before long distance transmission, which reduces the current and minimizes I²R losses, thereby making the transmission more efficient. However, higher voltage levels require careful insulation and safety measures. Step-down transformers are used near the consumer end to reduce the voltage to safer, usable levels. The trade-off is that while stepping up voltage reduces current losses, stepping it down is necessary for safe distribution, and each transformation stage can introduce small energy losses. Overall, these transformers are integral in balancing efficiency, safety, and practicality in power distribution.",
    "explanation": "This answer details the process of stepping up voltage to reduce transmission losses and then stepping it down for consumer use. The discussion includes benefits such as reduced I²R losses when transmitting at high voltage and the necessary safety considerations when using lower voltage levels for end users, as well as the inherent trade-offs in transformer operation.",
