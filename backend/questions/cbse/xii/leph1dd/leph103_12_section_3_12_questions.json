One method is to add the equations: (7I1 - 6I2 - 2I3) + (I1 + 6I2 + 2I3) = 10 + 10, giving 8I1 = 20, so I1 = 2.5 A. Substituting I1 into the second equation: 2.5 + 6I2 + 2I3 = 10 implies 6I2 + 2I3 = 7.5. Now, using the third equation: 2(2.5) - 4I2 - 4I3 = -5 gives 5 - 4I2 - 4I3 = -5, or 4I2 + 4I3 = 10, so I2 + I3 = 2.5.

Using I = emf / R_total = 10 V / 5 Ω = 2 A would be incorrect because the correct sign convention must be checked. However, if following the proper loop rule where current flows from N to P inside the battery, we use V_drop = I*r. In this case, if we assume the given voltage source is 10 V, then the loop equation becomes: - (I*4.5) - (I*0.5) + 10 = 0, or I = 10/5 = 2 A.
