    "correct_answer": "The electromagnetic spectrum is classified according to frequency and wavelength, with categories such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The classification is based on how the waves are produced and detected. However, there is no sharp division between the different types because the transitions between wavelengths are gradual and some properties overlap, meaning that the boundaries between the categories are only approximate.",
    "explanation": "The spectrum is divided based on practical considerations such as production mechanisms and detection methods. For example, radio waves are produced by antennas and detected by receiver aerials, while X-rays are generated by high-energy electron interactions and detected by photographic film or Geiger tubes. The overlap in characteristics means that there is no precise cutoff between one type and another.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic waves determine their interaction with matter and the type of detectors or transmitters that can be used. For communication systems, longer wavelengths (lower frequencies) like radio waves can travel long distances and penetrate obstacles, making them ideal for broadcasting and mobile communications. In contrast, higher frequency waves such as X-rays have very short wavelengths, which allow them to interact with matter at the atomic level, making them suitable for detailed imaging in medical diagnostics. This difference in properties requires specific design considerations for antennas, transmitters, and detectors in communications as well as specialized equipment for X-ray production and imaging.",
    "explanation": "The relationship between wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) is given by the equation c = f × λ, where c is the speed of light. In communication systems, lower frequencies (longer wavelengths) are less prone to scattering and can cover larger areas, while in medical imaging, the high energy and short wavelengths of X-rays allow them to detect fine details within biological tissues. This illustrates how fundamental wave properties directly affect the design and applicability of various technologies.",

Overexposure can lead to serious health hazards such as tissue damage, increased cancer risk, and radiation sickness. In medical and industrial settings, strict protocols and safety guidelines are enforced to minimize these risks.",
    "explanation": "High-energy electromagnetic waves have enough energy to ionize atoms and damage biological tissues. Protective equipment like lead aprons and specialized shields are used to block these rays, while controlled exposure times reduce the cumulative dose. Establishing safety protocols and using dosimeters ensure that the exposure remains within safe limits. Failure to follow these measures can result in detrimental long-term health effects.",
