    "correct_answer": "Electromagnetic waves are generated by accelerated charges, such as oscillating charges, which create time-varying electric fields. These fields induce magnetic fields that, in turn, induce new electric fields, leading to a self-sustaining propagation of the wave. The energy carried by the electromagnetic wave comes at the expense of the energy supplied to the accelerating charge.",
    "explanation": "When a charge oscillates, the resulting electric field varies with time and space. This time-varying electric field produces a magnetic field due to the displacement current as per Maxwell's equations. The oscillating magnetic field generates an electric field, and the cycle continues, allowing the wave to propagate. The process of mutual regeneration means the wave can travel through vacuum without a medium. However, the energy carried by the wave is drawn from the source that accelerates the charge, as it loses energy to sustain the oscillations.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In vacuum, electromagnetic waves propagate at speed c, which is determined solely by the vacuum permittivity (ε₀) and permeability (μ₀). In a material medium, these constants are replaced by the medium's permittivity (ε) and permeability (μ), resulting in a slower propagation speed given by v = 1/√(με). The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to that in the medium, reflecting how the medium's properties affect wave propagation.",
    "explanation": "Electromagnetic waves travel in vacuum with a speed c ≈ 3×10^8 m/s, determined by 1/√(μ₀ε₀). In a material medium, the intrinsic properties are altered by the presence of matter, where ε and μ replace ε₀ and μ₀ respectively. This leads to a reduced speed of propagation, v = 1/√(με). The refractive index n is defined as c/v, and it quantifies the bending (refraction) of light as it enters a different medium.
