    "correct_answer": "To derive the expression, first consider an infinitesimal test charge dq. The work done by an external force to move this charge from infinity to a point P in an electric field is dW. By definition, the work done per unit charge is dW/dq, which defines the potential V at point P. Since the force experienced by the test charge is qE and the work done (against the field) is integrated over a path, for a unit charge the potential difference between two points (say infinity and P) is V_P - V_infinity. With V_infinity chosen as zero, we obtain V_P = work done per unit charge. This derivation demonstrates that electrostatic potential is an intrinsic property of the electric field.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts with the notion of work done on a small test charge and then divides out the test charge to get a property characteristic of the field itself. It uses the integral of the force over distance and recognizes that the work is path-independent in a conservative field.

    "correct_answer": "Electrostatic potential, by definition, gives the work done per unit charge in moving a test charge from a reference point (usually infinity) to a particular location in an electric field. Since this work is independent of the path taken, it confirms that electrostatic forces are conservative. For instance, whether a test charge is moved along a curved or straight-line path between two points, the work done remains the same, which is a hallmark of conservative forces. This property is crucial in energy conservation, allowing us to define potential energy functions. An example includes the work done in moving a charge in the field of a point charge, where the potential depends only on the radial distance, regardless of the path taken.",
    "explanation": "The concept of electrostatic potential encapsulates the conservative nature of electrostatic forces by reducing the work done to a function solely of the initial and final positions. This enables the assignment of a scalar potential energy to every point in the field, thereby simplifying problems in electromagnetism and confirming that the field is conservative because the net work over any closed path is zero.",

Assume that the potential difference between two points separated by a fixed distance in Region A is 10 V and in Region B is 30 V. The problem demonstrates that the magnitude of the electric field (and hence the density of field lines) is directly related to the potential difference, given by E = ΔV/Δr. Thus, Region B, with a higher potential difference for the same distance, exhibits a stronger electric field. This analysis can be used to derive that if the density of field lines triples, the potential gradient—and therefore the electric field strength—triples as well.",
    "explanation": "The problem correlates the qualitative observation (denser field lines indicate a higher field strength) with the quantitative relationship E = ΔV/Δr.
