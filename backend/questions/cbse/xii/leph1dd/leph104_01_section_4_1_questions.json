    "correct_answer": "Oersted set up a demonstration where a current-carrying straight wire was placed near a magnetic compass. He observed that the compass needle deflected, aligning tangentially to an imaginary circle centered on the wire. By noting that the deflection was more pronounced when the current was increased or when the needle was moved closer to the wire, and by observing that reversing the current reversed the deflection, he concluded that moving charges produce a magnetic field in the surrounding space.",
    "explanation": "The experimental setup involved a straight wire perpendicular to the plane of the paper with a ring of compass needles placed around it. Oersted's observation that the needle deflected in a specific pattern revealed that the magnetic field lines were circular, which directly linked the phenomenon of electricity (current) with magnetism. This was the first empirical evidence that moving charges generate magnetic fields, laying the foundation for the unified theories of electromagnetism.",

This paved the way for the development of radio, television, and later, the entire field of wireless communications.",
    "explanation": "By unifying the laws, Maxwell provided a comprehensive theoretical framework that not only explained known phenomena but also predicted new ones, such as electromagnetic waves. Hertzâ€™s confirmation of electromagnetic waves validated Maxwell's theory, while later experiments and inventions by Bose, Marconi, and others utilized these principles to develop technologies that have transformed modern life.
