    "correct_answer": "Non-ohmic devices do not exhibit a constant ratio between voltage and current. For example, diodes have a V-I curve where minimal current flows until a certain threshold is reached, after which the current increases rapidly. This deviation occurs because the device's resistance changes with applied voltage, making the relationship non-linear and polarity dependent.",
    "explanation": "Ohm's law applies to materials where V and I have a direct proportionality (V = IR). In non-ohmic devices like diodes, the V-I curve is characterized by a threshold voltage after which the current rises sharply, and the relationship can be non-symmetrical depending on the direction of applied voltage. This behavior stems from the material properties and the junctions within the diode, which control the flow of charge carriers differently under forward and reverse biases.",

    "explanation": "In a non-linear V-I curve, the overall resistance changes with voltage and current. The dashed tangent line represents the best linear approximation locally.

    "correct_answer": "Non-ohmic behavior can complicate circuit design by introducing non-linear and unpredictable responses to voltage and current. However, these properties are also harnessed in devices like diodes and transistors, where thresholds, rectification, and amplification are needed. In essence, while non-ohmic behavior deviates from the ideal linear behavior for resistors, it is essential for the operation of many modern electronic devices.",
    "explanation": "Non-ohmic components require more careful design considerations due to their non-linear V-I characteristics. Although they may pose challenges in circuits that assume constant resistance, these properties enable functionalities like switching, modulation, and rectification.
