    "correct_answer": "A dipole in a uniform electric field has two equal and opposite forces acting on the positive and negative charges. Although these forces cancel out when considering the net linear force, they produce a torque because they are separated by a distance. The torque is calculated as the product of one force and the perpendicular distance (the arm of the couple). The resulting expression, tau = p x E, shows that the torque depends only on the magnitude of the dipole moment, the electric field, and the sine of the angle between them. Since the forces are equal and opposite, the specific point of application (or the choice of origin) does not affect the magnitude or direction of the torque; it is solely determined by the intrinsic dipole geometry and field orientation.",
    "explanation": "The explanation hinges on recognizing that while the net force is zero due to the uniformity of the field, the couple formed by the two forces creates a turning effect. This is independent of the coordinate system because the forces’ directions and distances between their lines of action remain constant.

    "correct_answer": "In a uniform electric field, a dipole experiences a torque, given by p x E, which tends to align it with the field, but there is no net force because the equal and opposite forces on the two charges cancel. In contrast, in a non-uniform electric field, the unequal field strengths at the locations of the positive and negative charges result in a net force in addition to any torque. This net force can move the dipole toward regions of stronger or weaker field depending on its orientation. A practical example is a charged comb attracting neutral pieces of paper: the non-uniform electric field of the comb induces a dipole in the paper, and the resulting net force draws the paper toward the comb.",

    "correct_answer": "An experimental design could involve suspending a dipole (for example, a small bar magnet or a charged rigid rod) from a low-friction pivot within a uniform electric field produced by parallel plates. A laser pointer attached to the dipole could measure the angular displacement. By applying a known electric field and measuring the equilibrium angle where the electric torque balances a restoring mechanical torque (from a calibrated torsion spring or gravitational component), one can compute the dipole moment and verify the torque relation tau = pE sinθ. Recording the angular deviation as the field strength is varied can confirm the linear relationship between torque and field strength, and control experiments with known dipoles can calibrate the system.",

The apparatus needs to minimize extraneous forces and friction, and the use of a laser pointer for precise angle measurement provides the required accuracy to validate the theoretical relationship between torque, dipole moment, and electric field.",
