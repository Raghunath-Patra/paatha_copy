    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The inconsistency arises because applying Ampere's law to a loop enclosing a capacitor appears to yield different currents depending on the surface chosen: one that passes through the wires (with conduction current) and one that spans the gap between capacitor plates (with no conduction current). Maxwell resolved this by introducing the displacement current, which represents the effect of a changing electric field between the plates. This term, when added to the conduction current, restores the continuity of current in Ampere's law and ensures that both surfaces give the same total current.",
    "explanation": "Ampere's circuital law originally considered only conduction current. However, in the case of a capacitor, no charge is physically crossing the gap. Maxwell's insight was to account for the rate of change of the electric field (or electric flux) in the gap, effectively treating it as a current (displacement current). This addition reconciles the law with the principle of continuity and conservation of charge and forms a cornerstone of Maxwell's equations.",

This unification laid the groundwork for modern technologies such as radio, television, and wireless communication.",
