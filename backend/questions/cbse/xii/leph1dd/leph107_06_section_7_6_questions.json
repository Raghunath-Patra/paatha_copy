After a long time, the transient solution becomes negligible because its effects decay exponentially, leaving only the steady-state sinusoidal response.",
    "explanation": "When an AC voltage is first applied, both the transient and steady-state responses contribute to the current. The transient part arises from the energy initially stored in the inductor or capacitor and decays with time constants determined by the circuit parameters (e.g., R, L, and C). The steady-state solution, which is periodic and in sync with the source voltage, persists indefinitely. Thus, for practical purposes and long time durations, the circuit is analyzed using only the steady-state solution.",
