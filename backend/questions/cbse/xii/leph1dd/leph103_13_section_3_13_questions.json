    "correct_answer": "Kirchhoff's rules are applied by first using the junction rule at nodes B and D, which in the balanced case (Ig = 0) equates the currents in the corresponding branches (I1 = I3 and I2 = I4). Then, Kirchhoff's loop rule is applied to two independent loops (for example, ADBA and CBDC) which results in the equations -I1R1 + I2R2 = 0 and I2R4 - I1R3 = 0. Combining these equations leads to the balance condition R2/R1 = R4/R3.",
    "explanation": "The answer must include the step-by-step application: First, the junction rule at nodes where currents meet gives the necessary current relations. Second, applying the loop rule around two different loops allows writing independent voltage equations. Solving these simultaneously yields the balance condition.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The inclusion of battery internal resistance would introduce an additional resistance in series with the battery, thereby altering the voltage drops across the resistive arms of the bridge. This extra voltage drop affects the current distribution in the circuit. The mesh analysis would need to incorporate the internal resistance in one or more loops. Although the balance condition (Ig = 0) still yields a relation between the resistors, the measured terminal voltage would be lower than the ideal battery voltage, and the exact equations would include terms related to the internal resistance. Therefore, more complex equations would be required to achieve balance, and the simple relation R2/R1 = R4/R3 might need correction factors to account for the internal resistance.",
    "explanation": "When the battery internal resistance is non-zero, it cannot be ignored in the loop equations. Its presence modifies the potential differences and currents in the circuit loops.
