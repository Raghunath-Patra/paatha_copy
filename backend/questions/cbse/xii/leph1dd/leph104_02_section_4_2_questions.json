This gives a direct link between mechanical force and the magnetic field. The Gauss, on the other hand, is a smaller unit equal to 10^-4 tesla. While the Tesla is used in most scientific applications due to its convenient scale in laboratory and industrial contexts, the Gauss is often used in fields like magnetism in astrophysics and geophysics where field strengths are much smaller.",
    "explanation": "The Tesla's definition through the Lorentz force equation (F = q(v × B)) ensures that the unit reflects the direct influence of the magnetic field on moving charges. In practical experiments, establishing a 1 T field requires controlling the force and charge parameters accurately. The Gauss is simply a scaled-down version (1 G = 10^-4 T) and is useful for measuring weaker magnetic fields such as the Earth’s magnetic field.
