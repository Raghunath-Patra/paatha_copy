    "correct_answer": "The potential difference V between the plates of a capacitor is defined as the work done per unit positive charge in moving a test charge from one plate to the other. Since the electric field between the plates is directly proportional to the charge Q, V is also directly proportional to Q. This linear relationship allows us to define the capacitance C as the constant ratio Q/V.",
    "explanation": "When a capacitor is charged, one plate accumulates charge Q while the other accumulates -Q, creating an electric field. The work required to move a unit charge against this field is the potential difference V. Because the relation between Q and V is proportional (as indicated by Coulomb's law and the superposition principle), the ratio C = Q/V remains constant for a fixed geometry and dielectric. This is the fundamental definition of capacitance, emphasizing that capacitance is independent of the actual charge or voltage but rather depends on the physical characteristics of the capacitor.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "Dielectric strength is the maximum electric field a dielectric material can withstand before breakdown occurs. In capacitor design, it limits the maximum potential difference that can be applied between the conductors. If the field exceeds this limit, the dielectric may ionize, leading to charge leakage. Therefore, to store a large charge without breakdown, a capacitor must have a high capacitance so that the charge required produces only a low potential difference, keeping the electric field below the dielectric's breakdown threshold.",
    "explanation": "A dielectric's strength determines the maximum electric field permissible without causing breakdown. Since V = Q/C, a larger capacitance results in a smaller potential difference for the same charge. This reduces the electric field strength between the plates, thereby preventing dielectric breakdown.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Practical constraints in capacitor design include the potential for dielectric breakdown and charge leakage, which occur if the electric field becomes too strong. To optimize the design, one must increase the capacitance either by increasing the area of the conductors or by decreasing the separation between them, and by using dielectric materials with higher dielectric strength. Additionally, employing materials with higher dielectric constants can further enhance capacitance, allowing for significant charge storage at lower voltages.",
    "explanation": "High electric fields can ionize the surrounding medium (for example, air), causing leakage of charge from the capacitor plates. To mitigate this, it is crucial to design capacitors that allow high charge storage at low potential differences, which can be achieved through larger plate areas, closer plate spacing, and improved dielectric materials. Materials with a high dielectric constant increase the capacitance without requiring a decrease in the separation, thereby reducing the risk of breakdown. This evaluation shows the balance between increasing capacitance and maintaining the dielectric integrity.",
