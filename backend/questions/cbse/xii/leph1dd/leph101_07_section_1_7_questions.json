    "explanation": "The acceleration in an electric field is given by a = eE/m. For an electron, m is very small, leading to a very high acceleration and a shorter time of fall compared to a proton, whose mass is much larger.

This supports the view that electromagnetic fields have independent dynamics and physically real existence.",
    "explanation": "In dynamic situations, such as accelerated charges, the effect of changes is not instantaneous but propagates as electromagnetic waves. This propagation with speed c implies that the field itself evolves over time, transports energy, and can influence other charges after a delay.
