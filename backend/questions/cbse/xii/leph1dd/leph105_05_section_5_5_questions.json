Ferromagnetic materials possess very large positive susceptibility and extremely high permeability, resulting in strong attraction and the formation of magnetic domains.",
    "explanation": "Diamagnetic materials oppose the applied magnetic field and show a slight decrease in the internal magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials have randomly oriented dipoles that align gradually in an external field, enhancing the field inside the material.

    "correct_answer": "When an external magnetic field is applied, the individual magnetic domains in a ferromagnetic material begin to align with the field. Domains that are already aligned grow at the expense of those that are not, leading to an overall increase in magnetization. This reorientation involves both the rotation of domain magnetizations and the movement of domain walls.",
    "explanation": "Initially, ferromagnetic materials have many randomly oriented domains, resulting in no net magnetization. Upon applying a magnetic field, domains aligned with the field expand while others shrink, drastically increasing the material's net magnetization.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Meissner effect is the expulsion of magnetic field lines from a superconductor when it is cooled below its critical temperature, resulting in a magnetic susceptibility of -1 and a permeability of 0. This perfect diamagnetism means that superconductors repel magnetic fields entirely, making them useful in applications such as magnetically levitated trains and powerful superconducting magnets.",
    "explanation": "In superconductors, the induced currents create magnetic fields that counteract the applied field completely. This complete expulsion eliminates internal magnetic fields, which is why the magnetic permeability becomes zero.
