    "explanation": "The greatest integer function [x] is constant between integers and jumps by 1 at each integer value. \nAt x = 1, the limit from the left yields a derivative of 0 (since the function is constant) while the limit from the right also yields 0 almost everywhere but the jump causes the derivative to be undefined at the point of discontinuity. \nA formal analysis shows that the function has no unique tangent (difference quotient) at x = 1 and similarly at x = 2.
