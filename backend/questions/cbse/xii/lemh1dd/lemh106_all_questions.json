As this limit exists and equals f'(x₀), the slope of the tangent line, which is the limiting case of the secant line, is f'(x₀).

In fact, a careful optimization shows that the maximum volume occurs when h = 2R and r = (R√3)/√?

    "explanation": "In the interval (0, π/2), cos x is positive and f(x) simplifies to log(cos x).
