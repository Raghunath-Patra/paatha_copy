    "correct_answer": "f is injective because if 1 + x₁|x₁| = 1 + x₂|x₂| then x₁|x₁| = x₂|x₂| which implies x₁ = x₂ after considering the cases x ≥ 0 and x < 0. It is surjective because for any y ∈ ℝ one can find an x ∈ ℝ (x = √(y – 1) for y ≥ 1 and x = –√(1 – y) for y < 1) such that f(x) = y.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: To prove injectivity, assume f(x₁) = f(x₂). That is, 1 + x₁|x₁| = 1 + x₂|x₂|. Cancel 1 to get x₁|x₁| = x₂|x₂|. Now, consider two cases:\n(a) For nonnegative x, |x| = x so the equation becomes x₁² = x₂² and since both x₁ and x₂ are nonnegative, we deduce x₁ = x₂.\n(b) For negative x, |x| = –x so the equation becomes –x₁² = –x₂², implying x₁² = x₂² and since both are negative, x₁ = x₂. Also, if one of x₁, x₂ is negative and the other nonnegative, the left–sides will have different signs, a contradiction.\nStep 2: To prove surjectivity, take any y ∈ ℝ. Notice that for x ≥ 0, f(x) = 1 + x², so if y ≥ 1, let x = √(y – 1) which yields f(x) = y. For x < 0, f(x) = 1 – x²; thus, if y < 1, set x = –√(1 – y) to obtain f(x) = y. Therefore every y ∈ ℝ has a pre–image, proving surjectivity.",
