Similarly, expanding along any other row (say the second row) gives |A| = a₂₁C₂₁ + a₂₂C₂₂ + a₂₃C₂₃. \n\nUsing the properties of cofactors (specifically, their relation through the Laplace expansion theorem) and the multilinearity and alternating nature of determinants, one can show that these two expansions must yield the same value.

Thus, it is established that the determinant is independent of the row or column chosen for expansion.",
