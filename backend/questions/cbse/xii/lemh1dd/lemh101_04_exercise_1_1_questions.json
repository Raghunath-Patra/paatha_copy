    "correct_answer": " (i) Since x - y = 0 if and only if x = y, the relation is the equality relation. It is reflexive (every element equals itself), symmetric (if x = y then y = x) and transitive (if x = y and y = z then x = z). \n(ii) For R = {(x, y): y = x + 5 with x < 4}, no element x satisfies x = x + 5 so the relation is not reflexive. Moreover, symmetry fails because if y = x + 5 it does not imply x = y + 5, and transitivity fails in general since chaining such relations does not yield the required form. \n(iii) In R = {(x, y): y is divisible by x} on A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, every number divides itself so it is reflexive. However, symmetry does not hold (e.g. 2 divides 4 but 4 does not divide 2) while transitivity holds (if x divides y and y divides z then x divides z). \n(iv) For R = {(x, y): x - y is an integer} on ℤ, note that the difference of any two integers is an integer. Hence R = ℤ × ℤ, which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. \n(v) (a) 'Works at the same place' is reflexive (everyone works at their own place), symmetric (if x works with y then y works with x) and transitive (if x and y work together and y and z work together, then x and z work together), so it is an equivalence relation. \n(b) 'Lives in the same locality' is similarly an equivalence relation. \n(c) 'x is exactly 7 cm taller than y' is not reflexive (no one is 7 cm taller than themselves), not symmetric (if x is 7 cm taller than y then y is not 7 cm taller than x) and not transitive (if x is 7 cm taller than y and y is 7 cm taller than z, then x is 14 cm taller than z, not 7 cm), so none of the properties hold. \n(d) 'x is wife of y' is not reflexive (no one is her own wife), not symmetric (wifehood does not reverse) and not transitive. \n(e) 'x is father of y' is similarly not reflexive, not symmetric and not transitive.",
    "explanation": "For (i), recognize that x - y = 0 precisely when x = y; hence every element is related only to itself. For (ii), check for reflexivity by testing if x equals x+5 (which is impossible) and similarly observe that the condition does not reverse for symmetry. For (iii), use the fact that divisibility is reflexive and transitive by definition but fails symmetry in many cases. For (iv), note that every difference of two integers is an integer, so the relation is universal.
