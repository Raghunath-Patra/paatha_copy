    "correct_answer": "For (i): The expression (2x – 1)² is always ≥ 0, so the minimum value is 3 (attained at x = 1/2) and there is no maximum value. For (ii): A detailed derivative analysis shows that the function has neither an absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum on ℝ (the behavior is determined by the asymptotic limits). For (iii): (x – 1)² is minimized at x = 1, giving a minimum value of 10; there is no maximum value. For (iv): Since as x → ∞, g(x) → 1 and as x → –∞, g(x) → 0, the function has no absolute extreme values over ℝ.",
    "explanation": "For (i), note that (2x – 1)² ≥ 0 so f(x) ≥ 3 with equality when 2x – 1 = 0, i.e. x = 1/2. In (ii), analyze the derivative and asymptotic behavior to see that the function does not attain a fixed maximum or minimum over all real numbers. In (iii), (x – 1)² reaches its minimum 0 at x = 1, hence f(1) = 10; the quadratic term grows without bound so no maximum exists. For (iv), examine the limits: as x → ∞, both numerator and denominator tend to infinity but their ratio tends to 1, and as x → –∞, the ratio tends to 0.",

    "explanation": "Set up the relationship between the cone’s height and radius using the geometry of the sphere. Express the cone's volume V = 1/3·πr²h in terms of R and one other variable, differentiate with respect to that variable, set the derivative equal to zero, and solve for the optimum. Substituting back gives the maximum volume as 1/27 of the sphere's volume.",

    "correct_answer": "Using the volume constraint and expressing the curved surface area in terms of the base radius, one differentiates the surface area with respect to the radius and finds that the optimum occurs when the height h is equal to 2r.",
    "explanation": "For a cone with base radius r and height h, the curved surface area is πr√(r² + h²) and the volume is (1/3)πr²h. With the volume fixed, express h in terms of r and substitute into the surface area expression. Differentiating with respect to r and setting the derivative to zero yields the condition h = 2r.",
