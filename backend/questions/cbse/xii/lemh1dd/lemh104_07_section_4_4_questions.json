This sum can be written as ∑₍ⱼ₎ a₁ⱼ Aᵢⱼ. If we expand the determinant Δ along both the first row and the iᵗʰ row, the fact that the iᵗʰ row's expansion is independent of the first row forces this sum to be zero since it corresponds to an expansion of a determinant where two rows are identical. Therefore, ∑₍ⱼ₎ a₁ⱼ Aᵢⱼ = 0.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Express Δ as an expansion along the first row: Δ = ∑₍ⱼ₎ a₁ⱼ A₁ⱼ.\nStep 2: Consider instead expanding along row i. Changing only one row in the expansion formula while keeping the other rows unaltered leads to a determinant with two proportional (or identical) rows if we, say, replace the iᵗʰ row elements with the first row’s elements. Since a determinant with identical rows is zero, the sum ∑₍ⱼ₎ a₁ⱼ Aᵢⱼ must be zero.\nStep 3: This is a consequence of the linearity property and the alternating sign property of determinants.\nThus, the result is proven.",
