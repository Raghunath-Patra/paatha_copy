    "explanation": "Step 1: Compute |A| = 2×2 − 4×4 = 4 − 16 = −12. \nStep 2: The property of determinants tells us that for a 2×2 matrix, if each entry is multiplied by k, then the determinant is multiplied by k². Here, 2A means each entry is multiplied by 2 so |2A| should equal 2²|A| = 4|A|. \nStep 3: Explicitly, 2A = [[4, 8], [8, 4]] and its determinant is 4×4 − 8×8 = 16 − 64 = −48, which confirms that |2A| = 4|A|.",
