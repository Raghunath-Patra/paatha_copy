Thus, 2 divides (b - a) and (b, a) ∈ R.\n3. Transitivity: If 2 divides (a - b) and 2 divides (b - c), then (a - b) + (b - c) = a - c is even.

    "correct_answer": "Proof:\n1. Symmetry: Assume L₁ is perpendicular to L₂. By definition of perpendicularity, L₂ is also perpendicular to L₁, so (L₂, L₁) ∈ R.\n2. Not Reflexive: For any line L, it is not possible for L to be perpendicular to itself, so (L, L) ∉ R.\n3. Not Transitive: Consider three lines L₁, L₂, and L₃ such that L₁ ⟂ L₂ and L₂ ⟂ L₃. In Euclidean geometry, if two lines are each perpendicular to a third line, they are parallel but not necessarily perpendicular to each other. Therefore, (L₁, L₃) ∉ R.\nThus, R is symmetric but fails reflexivity and transitivity.",
    "explanation": "The proof involves direct application of definitions. The symmetric property follows immediately from the definition of perpendicularity.
