The (i, j) entry of the product A × (adj A) is given by Σₖ (aᵢₖ × Cⱼₖ) (note the use of cofactors from the transpose structure). When i = j, this sum equals the determinant |A| (by the Laplace expansion using cofactors) and when i ≠ j, the sum equals 0 (since the expansion along different rows gives zero due to properties of determinants). Thus, the product is a diagonal matrix with |A| along its diagonal, which is |A| I.",
