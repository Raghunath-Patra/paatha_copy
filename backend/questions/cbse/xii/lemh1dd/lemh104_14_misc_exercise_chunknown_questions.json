    "correct_answer": "The determinant evaluates to 0 for all values of θ (or to a constant independent of θ). One may show this by either expanding the determinant or by noticing that the third row has all identical entries so that if two rows become proportional or if one row can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, the determinant is independent of the parameter.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Write the matrix as shown. Notice that the third row is (x, x, x).\n\nStep 2: Subtract the first column from the other two columns; this creates two identical columns or produces zeros in suitable locations.\n\nStep 3: After appropriate elementary operations, it can be shown that the determinant simplifies to an expression that does not involve θ (in fact, the algebra leads to the conclusion that the determinant is 0, which is independent of θ).\n\nThus, the determinant does not vary with θ and is independent of the angle parameter.\n\n(The exact numerical value may be 0 provided the row dependencies force the cancellation, which is a common occurrence when a row has identical entries.)",

First term: cosα cosβ × [cosβ · cosα – 0 × sinα sinβ] = cosα cosβ · cosα cosβ = cos²α cos²β.\n2. Second term: – cosα sinβ × [ (– sinβ · cosα) – 0 × (sinα cosβ) ] = – cosα sinβ × (– sinβ cosα) = cos²α sin²β.\n3. Third term: (– sinα) × [ (– sinβ × sinα sinβ) – (cosβ × sinα cosβ) ] = – sinα × [ – sinα sin²β – sinα cos²β ] = – sinα × [ – sinα (sin²β + cos²β) ] = sinα × sinα = sin²α.\n\nAdding up:\ncos²α cos²β + cos²α sin²β + sin²α = cos²α (cos²β + sin²β) + sin²α = cos²α + sin²α = 1.\n\nThus the value of the determinant is 1.",
