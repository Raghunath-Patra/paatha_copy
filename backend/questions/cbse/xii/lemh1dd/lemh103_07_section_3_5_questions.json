Therefore, the original matrix A is recovered.",

    "explanation": "To prove the property, we begin by expressing the matrices A and B in terms of their individual elements.

On the other hand, B' is 3×2 and A' is 2×3, and their product B'A' produces a 3×3 matrix whose (j, i) element is ∑ₖ bᵢₖ aₖⱼ. By renaming the summation index (since scalar addition is commutative), these two sums are identical, thus proving (AB)' = B'A'.",
    "explanation": "The proof involves comparing the (i, j) elements of AB and then noting that transposition reverses the indices.
