    "explanation": "One way to show collinearity is to compute the area of the triangle with vertices A(a, b+c), B(b, c+a), and C(c, a+b) using the determinant method. \nSet up the determinant:\n  Area = ½ | a[(c+a) − (a+b)] + b[(a+b) − (b+c)] + c[(b+c) − (c+a)] |\nNotice that each difference simplifies:\n  (c+a) − (a+b) = c − b,\n  (a+b) − (b+c) = a − c,\n  (b+c) − (c+a) = b − a.\nSo the expression becomes:\n  ½ | a(c − b) + b(a − c) + c(b − a) |.\nThis expression simplifies to 0 (through algebraic cancellation), which shows that the triangle's area is zero and, hence, the points are collinear. \nAn alternative observation is that for each point, the sum of the coordinates is constant:\n  For A: a + (b+c) = a+b+c,\n  For B: b + (c+a) = a+b+c,\n  For C: c + (a+b) = a+b+c.\nSince they all lie on the line x + y = a + b + c, they are collinear.",

The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from (2, 6) to the line y = 4, which is 2.
