      "(A) AÂ·B (with some erroneous condition)",

      "(D) AB = BA = I"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "(D) AB = BA = I",
    "explanation": "For two square matrices A and B to be inverses of each other, by definition their product in both orders must equal the identity matrix, i.e., AB = I and BA = I. Option (D) directly states this condition. Options (A) and (C) either provide erroneous conditions or do not satisfy the definition of inverse. Hence, (D) is the correct answer.",
