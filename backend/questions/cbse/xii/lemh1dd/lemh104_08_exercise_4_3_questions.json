    "explanation": "To find the minor of an element in a determinant, delete its row and column; the cofactor is then (–1)^(i+j) times the minor. For the identity matrix, most off-diagonal elements become 0, and the diagonal ones produce a minor of 1. For the second matrix, each element’s minor is computed from its corresponding 2×2 submatrix and then multiplied by the sign factor. The steps include forming the submatrix, calculating its determinant, and then applying the sign factor (–1)^(i+j) to obtain the cofactor.",
