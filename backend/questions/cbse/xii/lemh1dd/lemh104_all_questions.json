    "correct_answer": "Proof (by induction on the order n of the matrix):\n\nBase Case (n = 2): For a 2×2 matrix, the determinant is a·d − b·c, which is independent of whether we consider the first or second row for expansion.\n\nInductive Step: Assume that for all (n − 1)×(n − 1) matrices, expansion along any row or column gives the same determinant. For an n×n matrix, consider the expansion along the ith row: |A| = Σ (aᵢⱼ · Cᵢⱼ), where Cᵢⱼ = (−1)^(i+j) · Mᵢⱼ (with Mᵢⱼ being the minor). By the multilinearity property of determinants and the induction hypothesis applied to the (n − 1)×(n − 1) minors, changing the row or column along which the expansion is performed does not affect the overall sum. Hence, all such expansions yield the same result, proving that the determinant is invariant under the choice of expansion row or column.",
    "explanation": "The proof involves an induction argument where the base case is verified directly for a 2×2 matrix, and then it is shown that if the property holds for (n − 1)×(n − 1) matrices, it must also hold for n×n matrices via the Laplace expansion and the properties of multilinearity and alternating signs in the determinant function.",

    "correct_answer": "The determinant remains invariant regardless of the row or column chosen for expansion because the development formula (also known as Laplace expansion) satisfies the property that the determinant is equal to the sum of the products of the elements of any row (or column) and their corresponding cofactors.",
    "explanation": "The invariance of the determinant under expansion along different rows or columns is due to the inherent multilinear and alternating properties of determinants.

This sum can be written as ∑₍ⱼ₎ a₁ⱼ Aᵢⱼ. If we expand the determinant Δ along both the first row and the iᵗʰ row, the fact that the iᵗʰ row's expansion is independent of the first row forces this sum to be zero since it corresponds to an expansion of a determinant where two rows are identical. Therefore, ∑₍ⱼ₎ a₁ⱼ Aᵢⱼ = 0.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Express Δ as an expansion along the first row: Δ = ∑₍ⱼ₎ a₁ⱼ A₁ⱼ.\nStep 2: Consider instead expanding along row i. Changing only one row in the expansion formula while keeping the other rows unaltered leads to a determinant with two proportional (or identical) rows if we, say, replace the iᵗʰ row elements with the first row’s elements. Since a determinant with identical rows is zero, the sum ∑₍ⱼ₎ a₁ⱼ Aᵢⱼ must be zero.\nStep 3: This is a consequence of the linearity property and the alternating sign property of determinants.\nThus, the result is proven.",
