Therefore, if x ∈ [-π/2, π/2], then sin⁻¹(sin(x)) = x, but for x outside this interval, the periodicity of sine means that sin(x) = sin(x') for some x' in [-π/2, π/2] and thus sin⁻¹(sin(x)) = x' ≠ x in general.",

This allows us to define inverse functions like sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, and tan⁻¹, where every value in the range corresponds to exactly one value in the domain.",
