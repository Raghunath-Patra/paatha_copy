The graph of sin(x) over this interval shows a continuous increase from -1 to 1, thereby ensuring a unique mapping from output to input. This restriction is crucial in solving equations and integrals in calculus where the inverse sine function (arcsin) is applied.",
    "explanation": "The sine function is periodic over ℝ, meaning that without restriction, each y in [-1, 1] would have infinitely many x-values satisfying sin(x)=y. By restricting the domain to [-π/2, π/2], the sine function becomes one-one.
