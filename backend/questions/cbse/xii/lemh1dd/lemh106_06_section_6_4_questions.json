Consider x = c + δ with δ > 0: (f(c + δ) – f(c)) / δ ≤ 0. Similarly, for x = c – δ with δ > 0: (f(c – δ) – f(c)) / (–δ) ≤ 0, which implies (f(c – δ) – f(c)) / δ ≥ 0. Taking the limit as δ → 0, we obtain f′(c) ≤ 0 and f′(c) ≥ 0. Therefore, f′(c) = 0. A similar argument holds for a local minimum.",
    "explanation": "The proof relies on considering the difference quotient from both sides of the point c. Since f is differentiable at c, the left-hand derivative and right-hand derivative must both exist and equal f′(c).

    "explanation": "Even though the derivative is zero at x=0 for f(x)=x³, the function does not change from increasing to decreasing or vice versa at the origin. Instead, it continues to increase (or flatten in the case of an inflection point).
