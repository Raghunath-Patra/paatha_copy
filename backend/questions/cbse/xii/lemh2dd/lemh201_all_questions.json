Adding the original and this new expression gives 2I = π ∫₀ᴨ (sin x)/(1 + cos² x) dx. Next, substitute t = cos x, dt = -sin x dx. Changing limits: when x=0, t=1; when x=π, t=-1.

    "correct_answer": "Explanation and Proof: Partition [a, b] into n subintervals of equal width Δx = (b - a)/n. For each subinterval, choose a sample point xᵢ*. Form the Riemann sum Sₙ = Σ f(xᵢ*)Δx. As n → ∞, Δx → 0 and Sₙ converges to a limit if f is integrable. This limit is defined as the definite integral ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx. The proof involves showing that, given any ε > 0, there exists a partition such that the difference between the upper and lower sums is less than ε, ensuring the unique value of the limit. Thus, the limit of the Riemann sums equals the definite integral.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Partition the interval and define Δx = (b – a)/n. Step 2: Formulate the Riemann sum Sₙ = Σ f(xᵢ*) Δx. Step 3: Show that as the norm of the partition (maximum Δx) approaches zero, the difference between the upper and lower sums becomes arbitrarily small, ensuring convergence. Step 4: Conclude that the limit exists and is unique, defining the definite integral ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx.",
