    "correct_answer": "Algebraically, vectors are represented as ordered pairs (or triples in 3D) and can be added component-wise. For example, if A = (a₁, a₂) and B = (b₁, b₂), then A + B = (a₁ + b₁, a₂ + b₂). Geometrically, vectors are represented as arrows; vector addition is performed using the tip-to-tail method. For instance, if we have a displacement vector A from point P to Q and another vector B from Q to R, the resultant displacement from P to R is given by the vector obtained when A and B are added.",
    "explanation": "The algebraic properties include operations like addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication, conducted by operating on corresponding components. Geometrically, these operations are visualized using diagrams where vectors are drawn as arrows. The tip-to-tail method is used in the geometric interpretation of vector addition.

    "correct_answer": "To prove commutativity, let A and B be two vectors such that A = (a₁, a₂) and B = (b₁, b₂). Then A + B = (a₁ + b₁, a₂ + b₂) and B + A = (b₁ + a₁, b₂ + a₂). Since addition of real numbers is commutative, (a₁ + b₁) = (b₁ + a₁) and (a₂ + b₂) = (b₂ + a₂), thus A + B = B + A. To prove associativity, let A = (a₁, a₂), B = (b₁, b₂), and C = (c₁, c₂). Then (A + B) + C = ((a₁ + b₁) + c₁, (a₂ + b₂) + c₂) and A + (B + C) = (a₁ + (b₁ + c₁), a₂ + (b₂ + c₂)). Again, by the associativity of real number addition, these expressions are equal, and hence vector addition is associative.",
    "explanation": "The proof is based on using the definitions of vector addition in components along with the properties of real numbers. Commutativity follows from the fact that addition of real numbers does not depend on the order. Similarly, the associative property of real numbers implies the associative property of vector addition when performed component-wise.",
