The left-hand side simplifies to uv, so we have: uv = ∫ u dv/dx dx + ∫ v du/dx dx. Rearranging gives: ∫ u dv/dx dx = uv - ∫ v du/dx dx, which is commonly written as ∫ u dv = u v - ∫ v du.",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins with the product rule for differentiation: d(uv)/dx = u dv/dx + v du/dx. Since the derivative of uv is known, integrating both sides recovers uv on the left.

Now, for ∫ eˣ cos x dx, again choose u = eˣ and dv = cos x dx, yielding du = eˣ dx and v = sin x, so that ∫ eˣ cos x dx = eˣ sin x − ∫ eˣ sin x dx = eˣ sin x − I. Substituting back gives: I = −eˣ cos x + eˣ sin x − I. Therefore, 2I = eˣ (sin x − cos x) and I = (eˣ/2)(sin x − cos x) + C.",
