This is derived by considering the area function A(x) = ∫ₐˣ f(t) dt. By the first part of the theorem, A'(x) = f(x) and hence F and A differ by a constant. Evaluating A(x) from a to b gives A(b) - A(a) which equals F(b) - F(a) since A(a)=0.",

Given that A(a)=0, the constant is –F(a) and so A(x)= F(x) - F(a). Setting x = b yields A(b)=F(b)-F(a). Thus, ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx = F(b)-F(a).",
