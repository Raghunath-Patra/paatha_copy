(2) If the first toss is not a multiple of 3, a coin is tossed. The event 'the coin shows a tail' can only occur in branch (2). However, when a coin is tossed, the first toss is not a multiple of 3, so there is no die showing 3. In branch (1), although a die (the first toss) could be 3, no coin toss occurs. Thus, there is no outcome in which both 'the coin shows a tail' and 'at least one die shows a 3' occur, so the required conditional probability is 0.",

    "correct_answer": "Since A and B are disjoint, we have A ∩ B = ∅. Therefore, (A ∪ B) ∩ F = (A ∩ F) ∪ (B ∩ F) and these two intersections are also disjoint. By additivity, P((A ∪ B) ∩ F) = P(A ∩ F) + P(B ∩ F). Dividing both sides by P(F) gives P((A ∪ B)|F) = [P(A ∩ F) + P(B ∩ F)]/P(F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F).",
    "explanation": "1. Recognize that if A and B are disjoint, then the events A ∩ F and B ∩ F are also disjoint.\n2. Therefore, by the additivity axiom, P((A ∪ B) ∩ F) = P(A ∩ F) + P(B ∩ F).\n3. Using the definition of conditional probability, P((A ∪ B)|F) = P((A ∪ B) ∩ F) / P(F).\n4. Substitute the sum to obtain P((A ∪ B)|F) = [P(A ∩ F) + P(B ∩ F)]/P(F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F).",
