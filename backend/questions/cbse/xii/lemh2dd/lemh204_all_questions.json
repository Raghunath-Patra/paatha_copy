Since addition of real numbers is commutative, (a₁ + b₁) = (b₁ + a₁) and (a₂ + b₂) = (b₂ + a₂), thus A + B = B + A. To prove associativity, let A = (a₁, a₂), B = (b₁, b₂), and C = (c₁, c₂).

    "correct_answer": "Magnitude ≈ 10.0 and direction θ such that tanθ = (6 sin 60°) / (8 + 6 cos 60°) ≈ (6×0.866)/(8+3) ≈ 5.196/11 ≈ 0.472, so θ ≈ 25° above the direction of a.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Represent vectors a and b. Using the parallelogram law, the magnitude R of the resultant is given by R = √(8² + 6² + 2×8×6×cos60°) = √(64 + 36 + 96×0.5) = √(64 + 36 + 48) = √148 ≈ 12.17. However, note that the provided answer key indicates a different approach using components:\nStep 2: Resolve b into components: b_x = 6 cos60° = 3, b_y = 6 sin60° ≈ 5.196.\nStep 3: Sum with a’s components (a is along the horizontal, assume a = (8,0)): Resultant = (8+3, 0+5.196) = (11, 5.196).\nStep 4: Magnitude = √(11² + 5.196²) ≈ √(121 + 27) ≈ √148 ≈ 12.17.\nStep 5: Direction = tan⁻¹(5.196/11) ≈ tan⁻¹(0.472) ≈ 25° above the horizontal.\nThus, the resultant vector has a magnitude of approximately 12.17 and is directed 25° above the horizontal direction of vector a.",

    "question_text": "A vector has a magnitude of 10 units and is directed along a certain line. Construct a vector with the same magnitude but in the opposite direction.

    "correct_answer": "To construct the opposite vector, retain the same magnitude (10 units) but reverse the direction. The constructed vector is -v. When added to the original vector v, we have v + (-v) = 0, because they have equal magnitudes and opposite directions, canceling each other out.",
    "explanation": "The construction involves drawing the original vector v, and then drawing a vector of equal length in the opposite direction, denoted as -v. This is based on the concept that reversing the direction of a vector gives the negative vector. The additive identity property for vectors implies that any vector added to its negative results in the zero vector.",
