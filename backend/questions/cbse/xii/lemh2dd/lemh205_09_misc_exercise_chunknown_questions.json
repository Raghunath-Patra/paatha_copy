    "explanation": "Let the direction ratios of the first line be U = (a, b, c) and of the second line be V = (b – c, c – a, a – b). The angle θ between the two lines is given by cos θ = (U · V) / (|U||V|). Compute the dot product:\n\n  U · V = a(b – c) + b(c – a) + c(a – b) = ab – ac + bc – ab + ca – bc = 0.\n\nSince the dot product is zero, cos θ = 0, which implies θ = 90°.\n\nThus, the two lines are perpendicular.",
