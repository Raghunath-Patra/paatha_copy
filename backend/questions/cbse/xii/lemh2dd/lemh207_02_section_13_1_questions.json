    "correct_answer": "The correct answer is Option C. Kolmogorov’s axioms include non-negativity (P(A) ≥ 0), normalization (P(S) = 1), and countable additivity (for mutually exclusive events, P(∪ Aᵢ) = Σ P(Aᵢ)). The statement in Option C is not an axiom because the probability of the intersection of two events is not generally the sum of their probabilities.",
    "explanation": "Kolmogorov's axioms are: (i) Non-negativity: P(A) ≥ 0 for any event A. (ii) Normalization: P(S) = 1, where S is the sample space. (iii) Countable additivity: For any countable sequence of mutually exclusive events, P(∪ Aᵢ) = Σ P(Aᵢ).
