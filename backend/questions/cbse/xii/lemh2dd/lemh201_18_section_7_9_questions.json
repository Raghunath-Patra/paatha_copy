By the chain rule, the antiderivative of f(x) with respect to x can be expressed via t. Changing the limits: when x = a, t = g⁻¹(a); when x = b, t = g⁻¹(b). Hence, ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx = ∫₍g⁻¹(a)₎ᵍ⁻¹(b) f(g(t)) g'(t) dt. This derivation uses the chain rule and the substitution rule, thereby proving that the substitution method preserves the value of the definite integral.",
    "explanation": "The proof relies on the chain rule from calculus. It shows that under the substitution x = g(t), the differential dx transforms to g'(t) dt, and the integral limits adjust with the inverse function.
