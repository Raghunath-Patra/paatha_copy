Step 2: Using the continuity of f, invoke the Mean Value Theorem for integrals on [x, x+h] to obtain F(x+h) - F(x) = f(c)·h. Step 3: Divide by h and let h → 0, leading to F'(x) = f(x).

Form the Riemann sum Sₙ = Σ f(xᵢ*)Δx. As n → ∞, Δx → 0 and Sₙ converges to a limit if f is integrable. This limit is defined as the definite integral ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx. The proof involves showing that, given any ε > 0, there exists a partition such that the difference between the upper and lower sums is less than ε, ensuring the unique value of the limit. Thus, the limit of the Riemann sums equals the definite integral.",
