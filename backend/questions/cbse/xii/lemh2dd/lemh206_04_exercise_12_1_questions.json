    "correct_answer": "The optimal solution cannot be determined uniquely since the full constraint(s) are not specified.",
    "explanation": "In a linear programming problem the complete set of constraints is required to determine the feasible region. Typically, one would graph all the constraint inequalities (including non-negativity constraints) to identify the feasible region, determine its vertices and then evaluate the objective function Z = 3x + 4y at these vertices. The vertex (or vertices) which gives the maximum value of Z is the optimal solution. Here, however, the constraint 'x + y …' is incomplete; therefore, the problem statement is insufficient to find a unique solution.",

    "explanation": "To solve a linear programming problem graphically one must know all the constraint inequalities which define the feasible region. In this problem, although the objective function Z = 5x + 3y is given, the constraint is incomplete (only '3x + 5y' is specified without a relation such as ≤, ≥, or = and a numerical bound).
