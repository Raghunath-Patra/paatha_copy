Convert constraints into linear equations by replacing the inequality sign with an equality to graph the corresponding line. 3. Plot these lines on a coordinate plane. 4. Determine the half-planes that satisfy each inequality, and find the intersection of these half-planes; this intersection is the feasible region. 5. Identify the vertices (corner points) of the feasible region. 6. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex, and the vertex that gives the optimum (maximum or minimum) value is the optimal solution. The reason for the optimal solution lying at a vertex is explained by the convexity of the feasible region—any line (objective function) will touch the boundary at a vertex, ensuring that if an improvement is possible, it can be traced to one of the vertices.",
    "explanation": "The explanation begins by converting the inequalities into equations to visualize the boundaries of the feasible region on a graph.

By setting x = 0 in 2500x + 500y = 50000, we get y = 100, but this violates x + y ≤ 60. Similarly, setting y = 0 gives x = 20, which is within x + y ≤ 60. The intersection of x + y = 60 and 2500x + 500y = 50000 is obtained by substituting y = 60 - x into the cost equation, yielding: 2500x + 500(60 - x) = 50000 ⇒ 2500x + 30000 - 500x = 50000 ⇒ 2000x = 20000 ⇒ x = 10, then y = 50.

    "explanation": "The process involves first identifying the intercepts of the cost equation. Although y-intercept from 2500x + 500y = 50000 is (0,100), it is not feasible due to the storage constraint (x+y ≤ 60). The point (20,0) is obtained by setting y=0 and is feasible. Finally, solving simultaneously x + y = 60 and 2500x + 500y = 50000 gives (10,50) which satisfies both constraints. Checking all intersections ensures the correct vertices of the feasible region.",
