    "explanation": "First rewrite the integrand by factoring the denominator: x - x³ = x(1 - x²) = x(1 - x)(1 + x). Thus, 1/(x - x³) = 1/[x(1 - x)(1 + x)]. Decompose into partial fractions by writing 1/(x(1 - x)(1 + x)) = A/x + B/(1 - x) + C/(1 + x). Multiplying by the common denominator gives: 1 = A(1 - x²) + B x(1 + x) + C x(1 - x). Setting x = 0 gives A = 1. Next, using x = 1 yields 1 = A(0) + B·1·2 + C·1·0 so that 2B = 1 and B = 1/2. Similarly, for x = -1, we obtain 1 = A(0) + B(–1·0) + C(–1·2) so that –2C = 1 and C = –1/2. Integrate each term separately, using ∫1/x dx = ln|x|, ∫ dx/(1 - x) = -ln|1 - x|, and ∫ dx/(1 + x) = ln|1 + x|. Combining the results gives the answer.",
