    "explanation": "Step 1: Recall that the direction cosine along an axis is the cosine of the angle the line makes with that axis. \nStep 2: For the x-axis, the angle is 90°, so cos 90° = 0. \nStep 3: For the y-axis, the angle is 135°; note that cos 135° = -cos 45° = -1/√2. \nStep 4: For the z-axis, the angle is 45°, so cos 45° = 1/√2. \nThus, the direction cosines are given by (0, -1/√2, 1/√2).",

    "correct_answer": "If the line makes equal angles with all three axes, then each direction cosine is 1/√3 (assuming the positive direction). Therefore, the direction cosines are: l = 1/√3, m = 1/√3, n = 1/√3.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Let the common angle be θ. Then cos θ = k for each axis. \nStep 2: Since the direction cosines must satisfy l² + m² + n² = 1, we have 3k² = 1. \nStep 3: Solving gives k² = 1/3, so k = ±1/√3. \nStep 4: Typically, if the line is taken in the positive direction, use k = 1/√3, and hence the direction cosines are (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).",
