    "correct_answer": "Proof: Consider a parallelogram ABCD with vectors a and b assigned as follows: Let AB = a and BC = b. By the triangle law, a + b is represented by the diagonal AC in triangle ABC. In the same parallelogram, the side AD is equal and parallel to BC (hence AD = b) and DC is equal and parallel to AB (thus DC = a). Therefore, in triangle ADC, the diagonal AC is also given by b + a. Since the diagonal AC is the same in both cases, we conclude that a + b = b + a.",
    "explanation": "The proof relies on the properties of parallelograms where opposite sides are equal and parallel. By applying the triangle law to both triangles ABC and ADC within the same parallelogram, we show that the resultant vector (diagonal AC) is identical regardless of the order of addition, hence establishing the commutativity of vector addition.",

    "correct_answer": "Derivation: To find a - b, we recognize that a - b = a + (-b). First, take vector b and reverse its direction to obtain -b (which has the same magnitude as b but points in the opposite direction). Next, using the triangle law, place the tail of -b at the tip of a. The vector drawn from the tail of a to the tip of -b represents the sum a + (-b), which is by definition a - b. Thus, the expression for vector subtraction is derived as a - b = a + (-b).",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts by defining vector subtraction in terms of addition and the negative vector. Reversing vector b gives us -b, and by adding this to a using the triangle law, we obtain the resultant vector that represents the difference. Each step utilizes the fundamental principles of vector addition, ensuring that the method remains consistent regardless of the orientation or magnitude of the vectors involved.",
