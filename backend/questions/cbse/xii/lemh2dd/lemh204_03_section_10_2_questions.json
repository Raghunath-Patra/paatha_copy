    "explanation": "The primary distinction is normalization: direction cosines are always normalized (their squares sum to 1) because they arise from the unit vector in the direction of the given vector. In contrast, direction ratios are the actual components that might not satisfy this unit condition unless explicitly normalized.

    "correct_answer": "Let a point P have coordinates (x, y, z) and let r = √(x² + y² + z²) be the magnitude of the position vector OP. The direction cosines l, m, n are defined by l = x/r, m = y/r, n = z/r. Multiplying each of these equations by r gives x = l·r, y = m·r, z = n·r, thereby expressing the coordinates in terms of the magnitude and direction cosines. Moreover, since l² + m² + n² = 1, it is consistent with the geometry of the unit vector along OP.",
    "explanation": "Starting with the vector OP having magnitude r, we note that the angles made with the coordinate axes have cosines l, m, and n. By definition, l = cos α = x/r, m = cos β = y/r, and n = cos γ = z/r. Rearranging these expressions yields x = l·r, y = m·r, and z = n·r, which demonstrates how the coordinates of point P are directly determined by the vector's magnitude and its orientation. The consistency check, l² + m² + n² = 1, confirms that these cosines indeed correspond to a unit direction vector.",

Therefore, r1 can be expressed as a scalar multiple of r2, which by definition means they are parallel.",
    "explanation": "To prove the vectors are parallel, express the vectors in component form: r1 = (l·r1, m·r1, n·r1) and r2 = (l·r2, m·r2, n·r2). Since l, m, and n are common to both vectors, we can write r1 = (r1/r2)·r2. A vector expressed as a scalar multiple of another vector is, by definition, parallel to the original vector.
