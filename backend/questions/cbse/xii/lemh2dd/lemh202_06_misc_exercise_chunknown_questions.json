    "correct_answer": "The antiderivative of |x + 3| is found by considering the two cases: when x + 3 ≥ 0 (i.e., x ≥ -3) and when x + 3 < 0 (i.e., x < -3). For x ≥ -3, |x+3| = x+3 so ∫ (x+3) dx = (x²/2) + 3x + C₁. For x < -3, |x+3| = -(x+3) so ∫ -(x+3) dx = -(x²/2) - 3x + C₂. (The constants of integration may differ on each interval.)",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Recognize that the function |x+3| is defined piecewise:\n  • For x ≥ -3, |x+3| = x+3\n  • For x < -3, |x+3| = -(x+3)\nStep 2: For x ≥ -3, integrate: ∫ (x+3) dx = x²/2 + 3x + C₁.\nStep 3: For x < -3, integrate: ∫ -(x+3) dx = -x²/2 - 3x + C₂.\nStep 4: Sketch the graph by noting that the vertex of the V-shape occurs at x = -3, and the graph is symmetric about the line x = -3. The graph is linear on either side with slopes 1 and -1 respectively.\nStep 5: Thus, the general antiderivative is given piecewise as above.",
