If a red ball is drawn first, it is returned and 2 additional red balls are added so the urn has 7 red and 5 black balls (total 12), and the probability of red in the second draw is 7/12. If a black ball is drawn, then after returning it and adding 2 extra black balls, there are 5 red and 7 black balls with the probability of drawing a red ball being 5/12. Thus, using the law of total probability, the overall probability that the second ball is red is (1/2 × 7/12) + (1/2 × 5/12) = (7 + 5) / 24 = 12/24 = 1/2.",
