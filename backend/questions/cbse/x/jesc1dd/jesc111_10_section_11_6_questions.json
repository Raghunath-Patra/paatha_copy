    "correct_answer": "In Activity 11.5, after setting up the series circuit, the experiment involves first measuring the overall voltage (V) across the entire series combination using a voltmeter.

The process entails comparing the sum of these individual voltage readings (V1 + V2 + V3) with the total battery voltage (V).",
    "explanation": "This step-by-step procedure verifies Kirchhoff's Voltage Law. The experiment confirms that the battery voltage is distributed among the resistors in direct relation to their resistances: each resistor drops a portion of the total voltage, and the sum of these drops equals the battery's terminal voltage.
