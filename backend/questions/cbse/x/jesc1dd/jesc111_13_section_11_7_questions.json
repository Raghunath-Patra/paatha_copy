    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The iron is designed with elements that alter their resistance with temperature. At maximum heating, the designed circuit has a lower resistance to allow higher current flow resulting in more heat (higher power consumption). Conversely, at minimum heating, the resistance is increased, reducing the current and thereby lowering the heat produced.",
    "explanation": "Electric irons often have adjustable heating settings. A lower resistance at maximum heating allows more current (using P = VI) to flow, while higher resistance at a lower setting limits the current, which in turn reduces the heating effect. This regulation of resistance controls energy conversion into heat.",

    "explanation": "The process includes these steps: 1) Calculating current by rearranging Joule’s law: I = √(H/(Rt)). With H = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, and t = 1 s, I comes out as 5 A. 2) Using Ohm’s law (V = IR) to determine voltage: V = 5 A × 4 Ω = 20 V.",

Depending on the change, the overall heat production might decrease, but it is not solely determined by current reduction; the resistance term also contributes directly, so the effect must be evaluated in total.",
    "explanation": "Although an increased resistance for a constant voltage source does lower the current, the heat produced is given by H = I²Rt. Substituting I = V/R gives H = (V²/R)t, which shows that the heat produced is inversely proportional to the resistance. Therefore, if resistance increases, the heat produced actually decreases.",
