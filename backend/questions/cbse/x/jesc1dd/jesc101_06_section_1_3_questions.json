    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Corrosion has a significant impact on infrastructure by causing the deterioration of metals used in constructing bridges, railway tracks, ships, and buildings. This degradation leads to safety hazards and requires frequent repair and replacement, which in turn incurs high economic costs. Preventing corrosion through design, material selection, and protective coatings is essential to reduce financial losses and extend the lifespan of structures.",
    "explanation": "The corrosion of metals, especially iron, leads to the weakening of structural integrity. Continuous maintenance and replacement not only incur direct financial costs but also indirect costs like accidents and downtime.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Oxidation in fats and oils is a free radical chain reaction that begins with the initiation phase, where fatty acids lose a hydrogen atom to form a radical. This is followed by the propagation phase, during which the radical reacts with oxygen to form peroxy radicals and hydroperoxides. Finally, in the termination phase, these radicals combine to form non-radical products. The hydroperoxides can decompose to form aldehydes, ketones, and shorter chain fatty acids, which are responsible for the off-flavors and odors observed in rancid fats.",
    "explanation": "This multi-step process involves radical formation, reaction with molecular oxygen, and subsequent decomposition to various compounds. The formation of aldehydes and ketones is what primarily contributes to the unpleasant sensory changes. Effective prevention involves reducing oxygen exposure and using antioxidants to interrupt the chain reaction.",
