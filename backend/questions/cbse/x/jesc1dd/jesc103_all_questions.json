    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For sodium, the electron-dot structure is shown as Na•; for oxygen, as :O: (indicating the need for two electrons to complete its octet); and for magnesium, as Mg:. To form Na₂O, two sodium atoms (Na•) each lose one electron, transferring a total of two electrons to an oxygen atom, so the reaction is: 2 Na• + :O: → 2 [Na]⁺ + [O]²⁻. For MgO, magnesium loses its two valence electrons in one step: Mg: + :O: → [Mg]²⁺ + [O]²⁻. Thus, Na₂O contains Na⁺ and O²⁻ ions, and MgO contains Mg²⁺ and O²⁻ ions.",
    "explanation": "Electron-dot structures represent the number of valence electrons in an atom. Sodium (Na) has one valence electron (shown as Na•), oxygen (O) has six electrons and needs two more to complete its octet (illustrated as :O:), and magnesium (Mg) has two valence electrons (depicted as Mg:). When forming ionic compounds, metals lose electrons to form cations and non-metals gain electrons to form anions. In Na₂O, two Na atoms each lose one electron resulting in two Na⁺ ions while oxygen gains two electrons to become O²⁻. Similarly, in MgO, magnesium loses both its electrons to yield an Mg²⁺ ion and oxygen becomes O²⁻ by gaining the two electrons. These oppositely charged ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces, leading to the formation of ionic bonds.",

    "correct_answer": "Ionic compounds have high melting points because their crystal lattices are held together by strong electrostatic forces between oppositely charged ions. A significant amount of energy is required to overcome these forces, breaking the ionic bonds and allowing the compound to melt.",
    "explanation": "In ionic compounds, the ions are arranged in a rigid, repeating crystal lattice. The strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged cations and negatively charged anions (ionic bonds) requires a considerable amount of thermal energy to break. This is why ionic compounds such as NaCl or MgO exhibit high melting and boiling points.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ionic compounds consist of a lattice structure in which positively and negatively charged ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces. These forces require high amounts of energy to be overcome, which explains the high melting and boiling points. Their solubility in polar solvents like water is due to the ability of polar molecules to stabilize and surround the individual ions, effectively separating them. Furthermore, in molten form or in aqueous solution, the lattice breaks down and the ions are free to move, which allows them to conduct electricity.",
    "explanation": "The crystalline lattice of ionic compounds is characterized by a regular array of alternating charges. The energy needed to disrupt this arrangement—known as lattice energy—is high, leading to high melting and boiling points. In polar solvents, the partial charges of the solvent molecules interact with the ions, dissolving the lattice.

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Displacement reactions occur when a more reactive metal reduces the oxide of a less reactive metal. In this case: • ZnO: Reaction takes place when heated with magnesium (Mg + ZnO → MgO + Zn), but not with copper since Cu is less reactive than Zn. • MgO: No displacement reaction occurs when heated with either zinc or copper because magnesium is the most reactive among these metals. • CuO: Displacement reactions occur when heated with magnesium (Mg + CuO → MgO + Cu) and with zinc (Zn + CuO → ZnO + Cu).",
    "explanation": "A displacement reaction occurs if the metal used for heating is more reactive than the metal present in the oxide. Since the reactivity series given is Mg > Zn > Cu, magnesium can displace both zinc and copper from their oxides, while zinc can displace copper from its oxide.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Displacement reactions involve a more reactive metal displacing a less reactive metal from its salt solution. In Activity 3.12, when an iron nail is placed in a copper sulphate solution, iron displaces copper from the solution, forming iron sulphate and depositing copper metal on the nail. The balanced equation is: Fe(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → FeSO₄(aq) + Cu(s). This reaction demonstrates that iron is more reactive than copper, which is one of the pieces of evidence used to construct the reactivity series.",
    "explanation": "Displacement reactions directly show the relative reactivity of metals. A metal that can displace another from its compound in solution is more reactive. This method is simple, observable, and forms the empirical basis for establishing the reactivity series.",

    "correct_answer": "The experimental procedure involved taking samples of metals and burning them over a flame with proper safety precautions (using tongs and eye protection as necessary). The flame colors observed—such as yellow for sodium, dazzling white for magnesium, bluish-green for zinc, and red for copper—are significant because they provide qualitative evidence of the metal’s reactivity and the type of metal oxide formed. These observations, along with the differing ease of burning and changes in the metal’s surface, help in arranging the metals in order of their reactivity towards oxygen.",

Additionally, you can perform a conductivity test by setting up a simple circuit (battery, bulb, switch, wires) and inserting each sample into the circuit; metals will conduct electricity to light the bulb, whereas non-metals will not (with the exception of graphite which conducts due to its structure). b) These tests are useful because most metals exhibit malleability and conductivity. However, there are exceptions (e.g., some non-metal allotropes and soft alkali metals) so the tests may need to be supplemented by chemical analysis for a definitive classification.",

    "correct_answer": "Reduction.",
    "explanation": "The process used to obtain a metal from its oxide is reduction. In a reduction reaction, the metal oxide loses oxygen, usually by reacting with a reducing agent such as carbon (coke) or by using a more reactive metal in a displacement reaction. In some cases the process is carried out electrolytically. For example, the reduction of zinc oxide with carbon is shown as: ZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g).

    "correct_answer": "The extraction process begins with the concentration of the ore by removing gangue using physical or chemical processes. Next, if the ore is in the form of sulphides or carbonates, it is converted into the oxide by roasting (for sulphides) or calcination (for carbonates). The oxide is then reduced to the metal either by heating with carbon (for moderately reactive metals) or via electrolysis (for highly reactive metals). Finally, the produced metal is refined to remove any remaining impurities, often through electrolytic refining.",
    "explanation": "Each step is designed to address specific challenges: concentration increases the metal content, roasting or calcination converts the ore to a workable form, reduction isolates the metal, and refining ensures high purity.

Metals at the bottom (e.g., gold, silver) are less reactive and are found in their native state, requiring minimal extraction procedures. Metals in the middle (e.g., zinc, iron, lead) are moderately reactive; they are typically found as sulphides or carbonates which are converted to oxides via roasting or calcination and then reduced using carbon. Highly reactive metals at the top (e.g., sodium, magnesium, aluminium) cannot be reduced by carbon because they bind oxygen more strongly, so they are extracted by electrolytic reduction.",
    "explanation": "This categorization ensures that each metal is extracted by the most effective method according to its chemical reactivity.

    "correct_answer": "The iron nail in test tube B did not rust because the boiled distilled water contained little dissolved oxygen due to the oil layer placed on top. Without sufficient oxygen, the oxidation reaction necessary for rusting could not occur.",
    "explanation": "Rusting requires oxygen dissolved in water. The oil barrier prevented oxygen from entering the water, thereby inhibiting the rusting process.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Rust formation in iron involves a redox reaction where iron reacts with oxygen and water to form iron hydroxides that further dehydrate to form rust. The simplified reaction is: 4Fe + 3O₂ + 6H₂O → 4Fe(OH)₃, which then converts to Fe₂O₃·nH₂O (rust). Key environmental conditions include the presence of both moisture and oxygen. Higher humidity and the presence of electrolytes can accelerate the process.",
    "explanation": "This process is a series of oxidation reactions where iron loses electrons to oxygen. The presence of water facilitates ion movement, making the prolonged exposure of iron to a moist environment particularly conducive to corrosion.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Alloying involves mixing iron with other elements to alter and improve its properties. For instance, adding a small amount of carbon (about 0.05%) to iron produces steel, which is significantly stronger than pure iron. Additionally, when iron is alloyed with nickel and chromium, it produces stainless steel, which resists rusting and is widely used in kitchenware, architecture, and medical instruments.",
    "explanation": "The process of alloying changes the crystal structure and reactivity of the metal, enhancing mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. This method is critical in tailoring metals for specific uses in various industries.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One experimental design would involve placing identical iron nails in several tightly sealed containers, each maintained at a different level of humidity (for example, 20%, 50%, and 80%) using humidifiers and dehumidifiers. All other factors such as temperature, volume of water (if added), and exposure to oxygen should be kept constant. Controls should include a container with standard laboratory conditions. The expected result is that nails in environments with higher humidity levels will show more rapid rust formation due to the increased availability of moisture, which facilitates oxidation.",
    "explanation": "This experiment isolates humidity as the independent variable affecting rust formation. By controlling other variables, the effect of moisture on the oxidation rate of iron can be accurately assessed.",
