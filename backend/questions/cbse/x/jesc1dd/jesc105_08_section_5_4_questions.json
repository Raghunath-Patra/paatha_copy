    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Double circulation refers to the two separate circuits (pulmonary and systemic) through which blood circulates in the body. It prevents mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood and allows for more efficient oxygen delivery to tissues.",
    "explanation": "In double circulation, blood passes through the heart twice for each complete cycle – first to the lungs for oxygenation and then to the rest of the body – which is crucial for animals with high metabolic rates.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In one cardiac cycle, oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the left atrium, which then contracts to send blood into the left ventricle. After filling, the left ventricle contracts, pumping oxygen-rich blood into the aorta and systemic circulation. Simultaneously, deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium, moves into the right ventricle as the atrium contracts, and is then pumped to the lungs via the pulmonary artery during right ventricular contraction.",
    "explanation": "Each chamber has a distinct role: atria receive blood and serve as reservoirs while ventricles, with thicker walls, generate the force needed to circulate blood. The separation by the septum ensures oxygenated and deoxygenated blood remain distinct, which is critical for efficient oxygen supply.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Phloem translocation involves the active loading of sugars (like sucrose) into sieve tube elements from source tissues (e.g., leaves) using ATP. This increases the osmotic pressure in the phloem, causing water to enter and generating a pressure gradient that drives the movement of sap from sources to sinks (e.g., roots or growing buds). In contrast, water transport in the xylem primarily relies on physical processes: root absorption creates a continuous column of water and transpiration from leaves generates a suction force that pulls water upward.",
    "explanation": "While xylem transport is largely passive, relying on forces like transpiration pull and root pressure, phloem transport is an active process involving energy expenditure and osmotic gradients. Both systems are essential for plant survival and nutrient distribution.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Haemoglobin levels are influenced by several factors: in adults, males generally have higher levels due to the stimulatory effects of testosterone on red blood cell production, while females may have lower levels partly due to menstrual blood loss. In children, the ranges differ because of developmental and metabolic differences compared to adults. Hormonal influences, nutritional status, and metabolic rate all contribute to these variations.",
    "explanation": "The differences in haemoglobin levels are reflective of the body’s oxygen demand, muscle mass, and physiological processes such as menstruation, which affects adult females. Similarly, infants and children have different metabolic rates and developmental needs, leading to variations in their haemoglobin ranges.",
