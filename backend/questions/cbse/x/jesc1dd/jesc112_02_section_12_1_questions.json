    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": [
      "A) The needle is a small bar magnet that aligns with the external magnetic field",
      "B) The needle is attracted to the metal of the bar magnet",
      "C) The needle has an electric charge that interacts with the bar magnet",
      "D) The needle vibrates due to thermal energy near the magnet"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A) The needle is a small bar magnet that aligns with the external magnetic field",
    "explanation": "A compass needle is a bar magnet with its own north and south poles. When it is near a bar magnet, the magnetic force due to the external magnetic field causes the needle to reorient so that its north-seeking end points toward the field direction.",

      "A) Because magnetic fields repel each other",
      "B) Because at the crossing the magnetic field strength would be zero",

      "D) Because magnetic flux is conserved"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C) Because crossing lines would imply two directions for the magnetic field at the same point",
    "explanation": "If magnetic field lines were to cross, a compass placed at the crossing would be forced to point in two different directions simultaneously, which is physically impossible. This is why field lines are drawn as non-intersecting curves.",

    "correct_answer": "Magnetic field lines are imaginary lines used to represent the direction and relative strength of a magnetic field. They show the path that a north magnetic pole would follow if placed in the field and become denser where the magnetic field is stronger.",
    "explanation": "Magnetic field lines help us visualize how the magnetic field is directed and how its intensity varies spatially. The lines emerge from the north pole and converge at the south pole outside the magnet, while inside the magnet they run from the south to the north pole.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A compass needle aligns with the magnetic field because it is a small bar magnet itself. The north pole of the needle is attracted to the magnetic south pole of the field source, and it rotates until it is aligned with the direction of the force exerted by the external magnetic field.",
    "explanation": "When placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic forces act on the magnetic moments of the compass needle, causing it to rotate. The needle will point in the direction in which the magnetic field lines are oriented, effectively indicating the magnetic field direction.",

    "correct_answer": "Outside the bar magnet, magnetic field lines emerge from the north pole and enter the south pole. Inside the magnet, however, the field lines travel from the south pole towards the north pole.",
    "explanation": "This difference in direction is due to the continuity of the magnetic field lines—they form closed loops from the north pole to south pole outside the magnet and return through the inside, thus maintaining conservation of magnetic flux.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To draw magnetic field lines using a compass and a bar magnet, first fix the magnet on a paper and mark its boundaries. Place the compass near the north pole of the magnet and note the orientation of its needle. Then, move the compass so that the south end of the needle takes the place where the north end was previously, marking each new position. Connecting these marked points with a smooth curve gives one magnetic field line. Repeat the procedure beginning at different points around the north pole to trace multiple field lines.",
    "explanation": "This activity uses the natural alignment of the compass needle to determine the direction of the magnetic field at various points around the magnet. By stepping the compass along the path where its needle points, one can map out the continuous path of the magnetic field. The density of the drawn lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field, with closely spaced lines near the poles.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiment with iron filings involves sprinkling iron filings on a paper with a bar magnet placed underneath. The filings align themselves along the magnetic field lines, visibly tracing out the pattern of the magnetic field. Observations from the experiment include that the filings form curved lines extending from the north pole to the south pole outside the magnet. Additionally, the filings are denser near the poles where the magnetic field is stronger, indicating that the force is higher in those regions. This experiment thus provides a simple and effective visualization of both the direction (indicated by the line curves) and the magnitude (inferred from the density of the filings) of the magnetic field.",
    "explanation": "By using iron filings—which are magnetic particles—the experiment visually represents the invisible magnetic field. It confirms theoretical predictions: field lines are continuous, do not cross, and show varying intensity across different regions. This tangible demonstration makes the abstract concept of magnetic fields more accessible, linking theoretical principles to real-world phenomena.",
