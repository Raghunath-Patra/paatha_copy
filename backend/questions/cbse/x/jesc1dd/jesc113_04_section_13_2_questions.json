    "correct_answer": "Ozone (O3) is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms, while oxygen (O2) is a molecule with two oxygen atoms. O2 is essential for aerobic life, whereas O3, although toxic near the surface, provides crucial protection by absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the stratosphere.",

    "correct_answer": "Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are chemicals such as CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform. They damage the ozone layer by releasing chlorine and bromine atoms when they are broken down by UV radiation, which then catalyze the destruction of ozone molecules.",
    "explanation": "ODS are harmful because even a small number of these compounds can catalyze a reaction that destroys ozone in a repetitive cycle, reducing the protective ozone concentration in the stratosphere.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun splits molecular oxygen (O2) into two free oxygen atoms. Each free oxygen atom then reacts with another O2 molecule to form ozone (O3). The process can be summarized by the reactions: O2 --(UV)--> O + O and O + O2 â†’ O3. This process is essential as the ozone formed in the stratosphere absorbs harmful UV rays, protecting living organisms on Earth.",
    "explanation": "This process, known as the Chapman cycle, is vital to maintaining the balance of stratospheric ozone. Although this cycle creates ozone, it is offset by natural and human-induced destruction of ozone molecules, leading to concerns about ozone depletion.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Non-biodegradable waste, such as plastics, glass, and metals, remains in the environment for long periods, contributing to pollution, harming wildlife, and disrupting ecosystems. Current waste management strategies include reducing consumption, recycling, and proper segregation of waste. Biodegradable plastics are being developed to decompose faster than conventional plastics; however, they generally require specific conditions like industrial composting facilities for proper breakdown and may not be effective in all environments. Overall, while these strategies are steps in the right direction, a combination of reducing waste generation, enhancing recycling processes, and developing more efficient biodegradable alternatives is necessary to mitigate environmental impacts.",
    "explanation": "The long-lasting nature of non-biodegradable waste presents significant challenges for the environment. While biodegradable plastics offer a promising solution, their success is contingent on proper disposal and processing conditions.
