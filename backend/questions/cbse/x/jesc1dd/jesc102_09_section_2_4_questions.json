    "explanation": "For example, copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄·5H₂O) contains five water molecules per formula unit; these water molecules are essential for its characteristic blue color.

It is named 'Plaster of Paris' because it was originally made from gypsum found near Paris. A common application of Plaster of Paris is in the medical field for making casts to support fractured bones.",
    "explanation": "When gypsum is heated at about 373 K (100 °C), it loses part of its water of crystallisation to form a fine white powder (Plaster of Paris). This substance sets again when mixed with water, making it valuable in construction and decorative arts, as well as in medicine.",

The balanced chemical equation is: 2 NaCl(aq) + 2 H₂O(l) → 2 NaOH(aq) + Cl₂(g) + H₂(g). Chlorine gas is produced at the anode, hydrogen gas at the cathode, and sodium hydroxide remains in solution near the cathode. Industrial applications include the production of chlorine (used in water treatment and PVC manufacturing), hydrogen (used as a fuel and in margarine production), and sodium hydroxide (used in soap making, paper production, and many other industrial processes).",

The main uses of bleaching powder include bleaching textiles (cotton and linen), paper pulp processing, disinfecting water by killing germs, and acting as an oxidizing agent in various chemical industrial processes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The pH of a salt solution is determined by the relative strengths of the acid and base from which the salt is formed. Salts derived from strong acids and strong bases (e.g., NaCl from HCl and NaOH) are neutral as neither ion hydrolyzes in water. In contrast, salts from strong acids and weak bases (e.g., NH₄Cl from HCl and NH₄OH, or AlCl₃ from HCl and Al(OH)₃) produce an acidic solution because the weak base does not fully neutralize the acid’s effect. Conversely, salts formed from weak acids and strong bases (e.g., sodium acetate from CH₃COOH and NaOH) yield basic solutions as the weak acid does not impart significant acidity, and the strong base’s conjugate ion undergoes hydrolysis to form OH⁻ ions.",
    "explanation": "The concept of hydrolysis is central here: when a salt dissolves, its ions may react with water. If the anion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will react with water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic. Similarly, if the cation is the conjugate acid of a weak base, it tends to generate H⁺ ions, making the solution acidic. Examples from the text, such as NH₄Cl and CH₃COONa, demonstrate these principles clearly.",
