    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Carbon prefers to form covalent bonds because forming ions by gaining or losing four electrons is energetically prohibitive. The ionization energy required to remove four electrons (to form C4⁺) is extremely high, and the electron affinity for carbon is not sufficient to stabilize the addition of four extra electrons (to form C4⁻). Instead, by sharing electrons with other atoms, carbon achieves a stable octet in a more energy-efficient manner.",
    "explanation": "The high ionization energy means that removing electrons to form a cation is very energy-intensive, and the low electron affinity means that adding electrons to form an anion does not release enough energy to compensate for the repulsion and instability caused by overcrowding the outer shell. Therefore, covalent bonding, which involves sharing electrons, allows carbon to reach a stable noble gas configuration without the significant energy cost associated with ionic bonding.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Diamond consists of carbon atoms each bonded to four other carbon atoms in a rigid three-dimensional structure, resulting in extreme hardness and a very high melting point. Graphite is made up of layers of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, where each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three others in a plane, with delocalized electrons between layers contributing to its electrical conductivity and lubricity. Fullerenes, such as C₆₀, have carbon atoms arranged in a spherical configuration resembling a soccer ball, resulting in unique chemical and physical properties that differ from both diamond and graphite.",
    "explanation": "The differences in bonding dictate the physical properties of each allotrope. Diamond's 3D network of strong covalent bonds makes it extremely hard and optically transparent. Graphite's two-dimensional layers bonded by covalent bonds with weak van der Waals forces between layers allow it to conduct electricity and act as a lubricant. Fullerenes have a closed-cage structure which imparts high symmetry and unique reactivity, finding use in nanotechnology and materials science.",
