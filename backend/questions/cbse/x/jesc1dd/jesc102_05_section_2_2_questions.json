    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When diluting concentrated H₂SO₄, always add the acid slowly to water with constant stirring, never water to acid. This is because the dissolution process is exothermic, releasing a significant amount of heat. Safety precautions include wearing protective gear (gloves, goggles), working in a well-ventilated area, and using a container that can withstand thermal stress. The exothermic nature arises due to the strong interaction between the acid and water molecules, where water molecules hydrate the H⁺ ions, releasing energy.",
    "explanation": "The recommended procedure minimizes the risk of splashing and overheating. By adding acid to water, the heat is dispersed more evenly in a larger volume of water, reducing the chance of localized high temperatures that can cause burns or container breakage. The reaction is exothermic because the hydration of H⁺ ions and the breaking and formation of hydrogen bonds release energy.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Water plays a critical role in the ionization of acids. When HCl is dissolved in water, it reacts with water molecules to produce hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻) according to the reaction: HCl + H₂O → H₃O⁺ + Cl⁻. Dry HCl gas does not ionize in the absence of water; therefore, it does not produce H₃O⁺ ions and cannot turn dry blue litmus paper red. However, in the presence of moisture, HCl gas absorbs water to form H₃O⁺ and exhibits acidic properties.",
    "explanation": "The ability of HCl to produce H₃O⁺ ions is dependent on water. The presence of water molecules is necessary to stabilize the dissociated ions by hydration. Without water, the HCl remains in its molecular form and does not display the characteristic acidic behavior, such as changing the color of litmus paper.",
