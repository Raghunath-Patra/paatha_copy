    "correct_answer": "A battery consists of one or more electrochemical cells where a chemical reaction takes place between the electrodes and the electrolyte, generating a separation of charges. This separation creates a potential difference across the battery's terminals. When the battery is connected to a conductor, the potential difference provides an electric field that drives the electrons to flow from the lower potential to the higher potential region within the circuit, thus creating an electric current.",
    "explanation": "The chemical reactions within the battery convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy by establishing a voltage between its terminals. This voltage establishes an electric field along the circuit's conductive path, prompting electrons to move, which is observed as an electric current.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The analogy compares water flow and charge flow by highlighting the role of potential differences. In a water system, water flows from a higher level (tank) to a lower level, driven by gravitational potential energy differences. Similarly, electrons in a conductor move from a point of higher electric potential to a lower one when there is a potential difference provided by a battery. This analogy helps visually and conceptually understand that without a potential difference (just as in a horizontal tube with no height difference), there is no driving force for the flow.",
    "explanation": "The water flow analogy simplifies the abstract concept of electric potential difference by comparing it to a more tangible scenario of flowing water. Both scenarios require an energy difference to initiate flow: gravitational energy differences in water flow and chemical/electrical energy differences in circuits.",
