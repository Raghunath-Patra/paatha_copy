    "correct_answer": "The sky appears blue because the tiny molecules and small particles in the atmosphere scatter sunlight, and they scatter shorter wavelengths (blue) more effectively than longer wavelengths (red).",

    "explanation": "Particles with sizes much smaller than the wavelength of light (such as air molecules) scatter blue light predominantly, whereas larger particles scatter light of longer wavelengths.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The scattering intensity of light by particles is highly dependent on the size of the particles relative to the wavelength of light. According to Rayleigh's scattering theory, particles that are much smaller than the wavelength of light scatter short wavelengths (blue light) more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red light). This is because the scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. As a result, when sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered in all directions by the small molecules and particles in the air, making the sky appear blue.",
    "explanation": "Rayleigh scattering explains that the amount of light scattered decreases dramatically as the wavelength increases. This is why even though sunlight contains all visible colors, blue light is scattered much more than red. The relationship can be mathematically described by a dependence on the inverse fourth power of the wavelength. This detailed understanding underpins the observation of a blue sky during daylight hours.",

    "correct_answer": "The Tyndall effect can be observed in several everyday scenarios, such as when sunlight streams through a canopy in a dense forest, making the beams visible due to scattered light by water droplets or dust, and in a smoke-filled room where a beam of light from a small opening becomes visible. Its significance lies in helping us understand how light interacts with particles, which has broader implications in fields like meteorology, environmental science, and even in medical imaging where scattering principles assist in diagnostics.",
    "explanation": "Observations of the Tyndall effect provide insights into the behavior of light in colloidal systems. This phenomenon highlights the importance of particle size in scattering and is relevant in real-world contexts such as weather patterns, air quality assessments, and technological applications involving light propagation through media.",

    "correct_answer": "False; the visibility is due to the scattering by colloidal particles which are larger than the molecules present in a true solution.",
    "explanation": "In a true solution, the dispersed particles are too small to scatter light appreciably, which is why the path of the beam is not visible. In contrast, the larger colloidal particles effectively scatter light, resulting in the observable Tyndall effect.",
