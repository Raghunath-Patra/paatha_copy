    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "f = 16 cm",
    "explanation": "For spherical mirrors, the focal length (f) is given by f = R/2. Here, the radius of curvature (R) is provided as 32 cm. Substituting the value, we get f = 32 cm / 2 = 16 cm. In convex mirrors (using the given sign convention), the focal length is taken as positive in this context.",

    "question_text": "A concave mirror produces a three times magnified (enlarged) real image of an object placed at 10 cm in front of it. Where is the image located?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The image is located 30 cm in front of the mirror.",
    "explanation": "For a concave mirror forming a real, enlarged image, the magnification (m) is given by the formula m = -v/u, where v is the image distance and u (given as -10 cm according to the sign conventions for mirrors) is the object distance. With m = -3, we have -3 = -v/(-10 cm), which simplifies to v = -30 cm. The negative sign indicates that the image is real and formed in front of the mirror. Thus, the image is located 30 cm from the mirror.",
