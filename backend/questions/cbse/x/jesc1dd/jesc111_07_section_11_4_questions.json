    "correct_answer": "In Activity 11.1, students set up a circuit consisting of a nichrome wire, an ammeter, a voltmeter, and a variable number of cells. By successively increasing the number of cells, they recorded corresponding values of current (I) and potential difference (V) across the wire. The ratio V/I was calculated for each setup and found to be nearly constant. Plotting V against I produced a straight line through the origin. This linear relationship confirms that the voltage across the conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it (Ohm’s law).",
    "explanation": "The procedure demonstrates Ohm’s law by showing consistent resistance (V/I) regardless of the number of cells.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ohm’s law, V = IR, is fundamental in controlling the current in electrical circuits. By varying the resistance in the circuit while keeping the voltage constant, the current can be controlled. Devices such as rheostats (variable resistors) allow gradual adjustment of resistance. In applications like light dimmers or motor speed controllers, adjusting the resistance changes the current flowing through the circuit. This application of Ohm’s law enables safe and efficient regulation of electrical devices.",
    "explanation": "The equation I = V/R shows that current is inversely proportional to resistance. In practical circuits, the inclusion of a rheostat or a variable resistor offers a means to fine-tune the current without altering the applied voltage.
