    "correct_answer": "(a) For 1 Ω and 10^6 Ω in parallel: 1/Rp = 1/1 + 1/(10^6) ≈ 1 + 0.000001 = 1.000001. So, Rp ≈ 1/1.000001 Ω ≈ 0.999999 Ω (slightly less than 1 Ω).\n(b) For 1 Ω, 10^3 Ω, and 10^6 Ω in parallel: 1/Rp = 1/1 + 1/1000 + 1/(10^6) ≈ 1 + 0.001 + 0.000001 = 1.001001. So, Rp ≈ 1/1.001001 Ω ≈ 0.999 Ω (slightly less than 1 Ω).",
    "explanation": "In parallel circuits, the total equivalent resistance is determined by the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals of individual resistances. Since even a very high resistance (such as 10^6 Ω) contributes very little to the sum, the equivalent resistance remains close to the smallest resistance in the network. This principle is a direct consequence of the formula 1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... .",

Total current I_total = 2.2 + 4.4 + 0.44 = 7.04 A. The equivalent resistance for the electric iron to draw the same current is R_iron = 220 V / 7.04 A ≈ 31.25 Ω.",
    "explanation": "When different resistive appliances are connected in parallel, the voltage across each is the same (220 V in this case). The current through each device is I = V/R. The total current drawn is the sum of these individual currents.

    "explanation": "In a parallel connection, every device is directly connected across the voltage source, meaning they all receive the same potential difference.

    "correct_answer": "(a) To achieve a total resistance of 4 Ω, connect the 3 Ω and 6 Ω resistors in parallel. Their equivalent resistance is: 1/R_parallel = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2, so R_parallel = 2 Ω. Then, connect this parallel combination in series with the 2 Ω resistor: Total resistance = 2 Ω + 2 Ω = 4 Ω.\n(b) To achieve a total resistance of 1 Ω, connect all three resistors (2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 6 Ω) in parallel. Calculation: 1/R_parallel = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = (3 + 2 + 1)/6 = 6/6 = 1, so R_parallel = 1 Ω.",
    "explanation": "For part (a), combining two resistors in parallel reduces the net resistance below the smallest individual resistor, and adding another resistor in series (which directly adds to the resistance) provides the desired value.

Calculation: 1/R_parallel = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/24. Converting to a common denominator: 1/R_parallel = (6 + 3 + 2 + 1)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2, so R_parallel = 2 Ω.",

    "explanation": "Resistance increases with an increase in the length of the conductor because electrons have to travel a longer path, and it decreases with an increase in the cross-sectional area since a larger area provides more pathways for electrons.

    "correct_answer": "Current will flow more easily through a thick wire because it has a larger cross-sectional area, resulting in lower resistance.",
    "explanation": "According to Ohm’s law (I = V/R), a lower resistance (R) for the same voltage (V) results in a higher current (I).

    "explanation": "To determine the power delivered by the electric motor, we use the formula P = V × I. Substituting the given values, we calculate P = 220 V × 5 A = 1100 W. Next, to find the energy consumed, we use the formula Energy = Power × Time. Converting 2 hours to the appropriate units, either by keeping kilowatt-hours, Energy = 1.1 kW × 2 h = 2.2 kWh, or by converting to joules, 2 h = 7200 s which gives Energy = 1100 W × 7200 s = 7,920,000 J.

    "explanation": "In an electric heater, the heating element is specifically designed to have a high resistance so that when a current flows through it, the heat produced (H = I²Rt) is sufficient for heating purposes. The cord, however, is constructed from copper, which has a very low electrical resistance. This low resistance ensures that very little heat is generated even though the same current flows through it.

    "correct_answer": "In the circuit, the battery provides the electromotive force that pushes the current through the resistor. The closed switch ensures the circuit is complete and allows current to flow. The resistor restricts the current, causing a voltage drop across it. The voltmeter, connected in parallel with the resistor, measures this voltage drop. The reading on the voltmeter reflects the potential difference caused by the resistor's opposition to current flow, as described by Ohm's law.",

The role of the switch is to make or break the circuit, controlling the flow of current.

The voltage drop across the 12 Ω resistor is V = I × 12 Ω ≈ 0.24 A × 12 Ω = 2.88 V. Thus, the ammeter reading is approximately 0.24 A and the voltmeter reading is approximately 2.88 V.",

Using Ohm’s law (V = IR), the total resistance in the circuit is calculated by summing the individual resistances (5 Ω + 8 Ω + 12 Ω = 25 Ω). With the supplied battery voltage of 6 V, the current is 6 V divided by 25 Ω, which equals approximately 0.24 A.

    "correct_answer": "The analogy compares water flow and charge flow by highlighting the role of potential differences. In a water system, water flows from a higher level (tank) to a lower level, driven by gravitational potential energy differences. Similarly, electrons in a conductor move from a point of higher electric potential to a lower one when there is a potential difference provided by a battery. This analogy helps visually and conceptually understand that without a potential difference (just as in a horizontal tube with no height difference), there is no driving force for the flow.",
