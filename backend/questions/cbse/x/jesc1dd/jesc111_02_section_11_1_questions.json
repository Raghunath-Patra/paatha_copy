    "explanation": "When electricity was first studied, the nature of electrons was not known. Scientists arbitrarily assigned the direction of current as being the direction of positive charge flow.

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A simple electric circuit starts with a battery that provides the electric potential difference (voltage), which drives the flow of electrons (or current). When the switch is closed, it completes the circuit, creating a continuous path. Electric current flows from the positive terminal of the battery, through the closed switch, passes through the bulb causing it to glow because of the filament heating up, and finally, returns to the negative terminal of the battery. Each component plays a key role: the battery supplies energy, the switch controls the circuit, and the bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat.",
    "explanation": "The battery’s chemical energy is converted into electrical energy, pushing electrons through the circuit. The role of the switch is to make or break the circuit, controlling the flow of current. When the circuit is complete (closed), the current flows continuously, allowing the bulb's filament to heat up and emit light. When any part of the circuit is interrupted (open), the current stops flowing, and the bulb turns off.",

    "explanation": "The total charge Q that flows is found using the relation Q = I × t. With I = 3 A and t = 5 s, Q equals 15 coulombs. To estimate the number of electrons, divide the total charge by the charge of one electron (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C). This calculation shows approximately 9.375 × 10¹⁹ electrons are involved in the process.",
