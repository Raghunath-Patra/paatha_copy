      "A. It occurs slowly due to cell division.",
      "B. It occurs rapidly through changes in cell water content.",
      "C. It requires specialized muscle tissues.",
      "D. It depends solely on electrical impulses."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B. It occurs rapidly through changes in cell water content.",
    "explanation": "Immediate responses, like that of the sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica), occur quickly as the cells change their water content, resulting in a change in shape. This movement does not involve growth, unlike directional movements mediated by cell division and elongation.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B. It stimulates cell elongation on the side away from light, causing the shoot to bend toward the light.",
    "explanation": "In phototropism, auxin accumulates on the shaded side of the shoot, stimulates the cells to elongate more on that side, and causes the shoot to bend towards the light source. This is essential for maximizing the plant's exposure to light for photosynthesis.",

    "correct_answer": "D. Abscisic acid",

      "A. Auxin uniformly distributes along the shoot irrespective of light direction.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B. Auxin accumulates on the side away from light, causing differential growth that eventually redirects the shoot toward the light.",
    "explanation": "When the flask is turned, only the new growth responds to the light by redistributing auxin unevenly. This differential growth leads to a bend, while the old growth remains unaffected, highlighting the role of auxin in phototropism.",

    "correct_answer": "Immediate responses, such as the quick leaf movement in Mimosa pudica, involve rapid changes in cell turgor without any cell growth. In contrast, growth-mediated movements, like phototropism, occur as a result of differential cell elongation over a longer period.",
    "explanation": "Immediate responses are characterized by a fast reaction due to changes in cell water content, while growth-mediated movements depend on differential cell growth and division.

    "correct_answer": "Plant hormones such as auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, and abscisic acid play vital roles in coordinating plant growth and responses. Auxins promote cell elongation (key in phototropism), gibberellins assist in stem elongation, cytokinins encourage cell division in areas like fruits and seeds, and abscisic acid slows or inhibits growth, particularly under stress.",
    "explanation": "These hormones are synthesized in specific parts of the plant and then transported to target cells where they regulate growth, development, and response to environmental changes. Their coordinated action ensures that plant growth is both controlled and adaptable to external conditions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Plants lack specialized nervous and muscle tissues, yet they can respond swiftly to stimuli. In plants, the immediate response involves the transmission of signals via electrical-chemical means between cells, leading to rapid changes in cell turgor by altering water content. In contrast, animals utilize a nervous system with specialized neurons and muscles that use electrical impulses and chemical neurotransmitters to effect quick movements.",
    "explanation": "While animal responses rely on fast electrical impulses along nerves and subsequent muscle contraction, plants depend on changes in water pressure within cells to generate movement. Although slower than neuronal transmission, the plantâ€™s method effectively coordinates rapid responses (like the folding of Mimosa pudica leaves) without specialized tissues. This comparison highlights the diversity of biological mechanisms evolved to ensure survival in different life forms.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the bean seed experiment, seedlings placed in a conical flask within a cardboard box are exposed to light from one direction. The shoots bend towards the light due to the differential growth of cells. This occurs because auxin, a growth-promoting hormone synthesized at the shoot tip, accumulates on the shaded side of the shoot, stimulating cell elongation on that side. Conversely, roots grow downwardâ€”the response includes both avoidance of light and a positive response to gravity (geotropism).",
    "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates phototropism by showing that shoots reorient themselves towards the light, optimizing photosynthetic efficiency. The redistributive action of the hormone auxin is key to this process. The experiment also illustrates that only new growth responds to the change in light direction, as older parts remain unchanged. Such responses are critical for a plant's adaptation to its environment and illustrate the importance of hormonal regulation in directional growth.",
