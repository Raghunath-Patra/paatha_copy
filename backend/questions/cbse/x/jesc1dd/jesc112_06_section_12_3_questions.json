    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experimental setup consists of a current-carrying aluminium rod placed within the magnetic field of a magnet. A displacement is observed when the current flows, indicating a force on the rod. By reversing the current or the magnetic field direction, the displacement is reversed, validating that the direction of the force is determined by the relative orientations of the current and the magnetic field. Fleming’s left-hand rule explains this behavior by having the forefinger, middle finger, and thumb respectively represent the directions of the field, current, and force.",
    "explanation": "The observed rod displacement under variable current and field orientations shows that the magnetic force is perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field.

    "correct_answer": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) makes use of the magnetic fields produced by the body’s ionic currents in combination with externally applied strong magnetic fields. The human body, though producing extremely weak magnetic fields (about one-billionth of Earth's magnetic field), can be imaged when placed in a powerful magnetic field. Nuclear magnetic resonance is induced and the resulting signals are detected and analyzed to produce detailed images of internal tissues. This technique is based on the fundamental principle that currents (or moving ions) produce magnetic fields, which in turn can influence how nuclei in the body respond to strong magnetic fields.",
    "explanation": "MRI relies on aligning the nuclei in a strong external magnetic field; radiofrequency pulses then disturb this alignment. The nuclei return to their alignment at different rates, emitting signals that are captured and converted into images. The underlying concept is that the intrinsic ionic currents, even if extremely weak, are related to the magnetic properties of the tissues, thereby aiding in the diagnosis.",

    "explanation": "The formula F = B I L sinθ reveals that for maximum force, sinθ must be at its maximum value, which happens when the angle (θ) between the current and the field is 90°. When the current is parallel to the field, sin 0° = 0, leading to zero force.",

    "correct_answer": "Reversing the magnetic poles in the experimental setup reverses the direction of the magnetic field. According to Fleming’s left-hand rule, when the magnetic field direction is reversed (while maintaining the current direction), the resulting force on the conductor also reverses. This is because the force is determined as perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current, so any reversal in one of these vectors reverses the force vector.",
    "explanation": "In practice, when the poles are switched, the field lines which were originally in one direction now point in the opposite direction. Maintaining the current direction results in a new orientation for the force (the thumb in Fleming’s rule) that is opposite to the original force. This demonstration reinforces the vector nature of magnetic force and its dependency on both the direction and magnitude of the field and current.",

    "correct_answer": "The conventional current is defined as the flow of positive charge. Since electrons are negatively charged and flow in the opposite direction to that of positive charges, the conventional current direction is opposite to the direction of electron flow.",
