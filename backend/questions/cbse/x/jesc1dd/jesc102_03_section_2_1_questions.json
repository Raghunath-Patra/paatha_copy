    "explanation": "In this reaction, the basic property of the metallic oxide CuO is highlighted as it reacts in a similar manner to bases with acids. Hydrochloric acid dissolves the copper oxide, and the resulting blue-green solution is due to the formation of copper(II) chloride.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Olfactory indicators are substances that change or lose their characteristic smell when exposed to a different pH environment. For instance, in acid solutions, the distinct odours of onions, vanilla essence, and clove oil are retained; however, in basic solutions, these smells are diminished or lost. This difference in odour allows even visually impaired students to identify whether a solution is acidic or basic.",
    "explanation": "The experiments described show that after treating the olfactory indicator substrates with an acid (like HCl), the characteristic odour remains consistent, whereas exposure to a base (like NaOH) leads to a significant change or loss of the smell. This behaviour helps in distinguishing the pH of a solution and extends the sensory methods available for chemical testing beyond visual changes alone.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To determine whether an unknown solution is acidic or basic, first prepare a series of indicator tests. Step 1: Using visual indicators, add a drop of red and blue litmus: if red remains unchanged and blue turns red, the solution is acidic; if red turns blue and blue remains unchanged, it is basic. Step 2: Add a few drops of phenolphthalein: a pink coloration indicates a basic solution, while its absence indicates an acidic or neutral solution. Step 3: For olfactory testing, use cloth strips impregnated with onion, vanilla, or clove oil. Observe whether their natural odour is preserved (acidic) or diminished (basic). Based on these multiple tests, if all visual and olfactory indicators point to the same pH behavior, the identity of the unknown solution can be confidently confirmed.",
    "explanation": "This procedure combines multiple techniques to reduce error. Visual indicators like litmus and phenolphthalein provide immediate color changes, while olfactory indicators give additional confirmation by the change in characteristic smells. Such multi-method analysis helps to ensure accurate and reliable pH determination in diverse laboratory settings.",
