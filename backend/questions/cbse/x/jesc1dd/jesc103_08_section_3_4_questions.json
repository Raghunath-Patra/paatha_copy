    "correct_answer": "Roasting is used to convert sulphide ores into metal oxides by heating the ore in excess air.",
    "explanation": "Roasting involves heating sulphide ores with excess oxygen, which converts them into oxides and releases sulfur dioxide gas. This conversion is necessary since metal oxides are easier to reduce than sulphides.",

    "correct_answer": "Electrolysis; these metals are highly reactive and cannot be reduced by carbon; hence, electrolysis of their molten chlorides or oxides is used.",
    "explanation": "Highly reactive metals like sodium, magnesium, calcium, and aluminium have a strong affinity for oxygen. As a result, their oxides cannot be reduced by carbon and instead require electrolytic reduction, which deposits the metal at the cathode.",

    "correct_answer": "Metals at the top of the reactivity series have a higher affinity for oxygen than carbon. Therefore, carbon cannot reduce their oxides to the free metal.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The extraction process begins with the concentration of the ore by removing gangue using physical or chemical processes. Next, if the ore is in the form of sulphides or carbonates, it is converted into the oxide by roasting (for sulphides) or calcination (for carbonates). The oxide is then reduced to the metal either by heating with carbon (for moderately reactive metals) or via electrolysis (for highly reactive metals). Finally, the produced metal is refined to remove any remaining impurities, often through electrolytic refining.",
    "explanation": "Each step is designed to address specific challenges: concentration increases the metal content, roasting or calcination converts the ore to a workable form, reduction isolates the metal, and refining ensures high purity. This comprehensive approach highlights the interdependency of various techniques in metallurgical extraction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reactivity series ranks metals by their tendency to lose electrons. Metals at the bottom (e.g., gold, silver) are less reactive and are found in their native state, requiring minimal extraction procedures. Metals in the middle (e.g., zinc, iron, lead) are moderately reactive; they are typically found as sulphides or carbonates which are converted to oxides via roasting or calcination and then reduced using carbon. Highly reactive metals at the top (e.g., sodium, magnesium, aluminium) cannot be reduced by carbon because they bind oxygen more strongly, so they are extracted by electrolytic reduction.",
    "explanation": "This categorization ensures that each metal is extracted by the most effective method according to its chemical reactivity. For instance, aluminium is obtained from aluminium oxide by the electrolytic process, whereas iron is produced from its oxide using carbon reduction. These examples underscore the importance of the reactivity series in designing extraction methods.",

    "correct_answer": "The thermit reaction involves the reduction of iron(III) oxide (Feâ‚‚Oâ‚ƒ) with aluminium powder to produce molten iron and aluminium oxide. The balanced equation is: Feâ‚‚Oâ‚ƒ(s) + 2Al(s) â†’ 2Fe(l) + Alâ‚‚Oâ‚ƒ(s) + Heat. This highly exothermic reaction produces enough heat to melt the iron, which is exploited in welding applications such as joining railway tracks.",
