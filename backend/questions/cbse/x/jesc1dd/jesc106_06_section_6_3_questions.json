    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When adrenaline is released into the bloodstream, it causes several coordinated effects: the heart rate increases to deliver more oxygen to muscles; blood vessels supplying the digestive system and skin constrict, diverting blood to skeletal muscles; and the rate of breathing increases due to muscle contractions of the diaphragm and rib cage. These changes prepare the body to either fight or run in response to a stressor.",
    "explanation": "Adrenaline acts as a systemic signal that mobilizes energy stores and optimizes blood flow towards vital organs needed during emergencies, a process known as the 'fight or flight' response. This hormonal action shows how the endocrine system integrates multiple physiological responses during stress.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Feedback mechanisms, usually negative feedback loops, maintain hormone balance by adjusting hormone secretion based on the body’s needs. For example, when blood sugar rises, pancreatic beta cells release more insulin to lower glucose levels. As the blood sugar normalizes, insulin secretion decreases. Similarly, if the levels of growth hormone are low, the hypothalamus secretes growth hormone releasing factor, stimulating the pituitary gland to produce more growth hormone. This dynamic regulation ensures that hormone levels remain within the optimal range.",
    "explanation": "Feedback loops are essential for homeostasis, ensuring that hormones do not exceed or drop below required levels. In negative feedback, the end product of a process inhibits its further production; in positive feedback (less common in hormone regulation), the process is amplified. Examples include both insulin and growth hormone regulation.",

    "correct_answer": "Hormonal imbalances, particularly with growth hormone levels, can significantly alter physical growth. A deficiency of growth hormone during childhood can lead to dwarfism, characterized by short stature and underdeveloped bones, whereas an excess of growth hormone can cause gigantism, where individuals grow excessively tall and may suffer from joint problems and other health issues. These conditions illustrate how precise hormone regulation is crucial for normal development.",
    "explanation": "Growth hormone is critical during the developmental stages; its balance is maintained via feedback mechanisms. Disturbances in this balance can lead to abnormal growth patterns, underscoring the importance of hormonal regulation in ensuring proper development and overall health.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experimental design would involve two groups of an appropriate animal model: a control group fed a normal diet containing adequate iodine and an experimental group on an iodine-deficient diet. The independent variable is iodine intake, and dependent variables are indicators of thyroid function such as levels of thyroxin, size of the thyroid gland (to detect goitre), and metabolic rate. It is expected that the iodine-deficient group will show decreased thyroxin levels, an enlarged thyroid gland, and altered metabolic function compared to controls.",
    "explanation": "This experiment would test the hypothesis that iodine is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. Measurements would include blood assays for thyroxin levels and histological examination of the thyroid gland.
