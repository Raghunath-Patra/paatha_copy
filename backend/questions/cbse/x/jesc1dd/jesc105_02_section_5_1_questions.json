    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A transportation system is necessary because as the body size increases, not all cells are in direct contact with the environment. This system helps distribute food, oxygen, and remove waste efficiently, overcoming the slow and limited process of simple diffusion.",
    "explanation": "In multicellular organisms, internal cells cannot rely solely on diffusion due to distance limitations. A specialized transportation mechanism ensures all cells receive vital substances, thereby supporting efficient function and survival.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Respiration is a cellular process where oxygen is used to oxidize food molecules, such as glucose (C6H12O6). The chemical reaction, C6H12O6 + 6O2 â†’ 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy, demonstrates how oxygen enables the breakdown of carbon-based molecules to produce energy. The energy released is used for cellular activities and maintenance, while carbon dioxide and water are expelled as waste.",
    "explanation": "In respiration, oxidizing-reducing reactions break down food molecules, releasing energy stored in chemical bonds. Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, making the process efficient. This energy fuels molecular movements necessary for maintaining life structures and functions, while by-products are managed through excretion.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Single-celled organisms typically rely on direct diffusion across the cell membrane for nutrient uptake and waste removal because the entire surface is in direct contact with the environment. In contrast, multicellular organisms develop specialized tissues and organs that facilitate the uptake and transport of nutrients and oxygen to internal cells, as well as the efficient removal of wastes through dedicated excretory systems.",
    "explanation": "The simple diffusion method works for single-celled organisms due to their small size and high surface area-to-volume ratio. However, in larger, complex organisms, diffusion alone is insufficient; thus, specialized systems such as the circulatory and excretory systems evolved to overcome these limitations, ensuring that cells deep within the body receive adequate sustenance and that toxic by-products are effectively removed.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Nutrition, respiration, and excretion are interconnected processes that together ensure homeostasis. Nutrition brings in food and raw materials from the external environment, respiration converts these materials into usable energy while producing waste by-products, and excretion removes these wastes to maintain a stable internal environment. The failure of any one process can disrupt cellular functions and overall organismal homeostasis.",
    "explanation": "The processes work in tandem: nutrition supplies the necessary inputs, respiration extracts energy and creates waste, and excretion prevents the accumulation of harmful substances. This interconnected network is essential for the maintenance of life processes, enabling the organism to sustain growth, repair, and overall function.",
