      "B: Green",

    "correct_answer": "C: Violet. Violet light deviates the most because it travels slowest in glass due to its shorter wavelength.",
    "explanation": "In a prism, different wavelengths of light bend by different amounts. Since violet light has a shorter wavelength, it experiences a higher refractive index in glass and bends more compared to other colours.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Violet light bends more than red light because its wavelength is shorter, resulting in a higher refractive index in glass. Therefore, violet light travels slower in the medium, causing it to deviate at a larger angle compared to red light.",
    "explanation": "The refractive index of a medium depends on the wavelength of the light passing through it. Since violet light has a shorter wavelength, it experiences a greater slowing effect in the glass and, as a result, bends more than red light which has a longer wavelength.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process of dispersion involves several steps: First, a narrow beam of white light enters the glass prism. At the first interface, light refracts (bends) as it enters a denser medium. Each colour within the white light beam has a unique wavelength, and thus, a slightly different speed in the glass. As a result, the different colours bend at different angles. Violet, having the shortest wavelength, slows down the most and bends the greatest, whereas red, with the longest wavelength, bends the least. This difference in the angle of refraction causes the light to separate into a spectrum of colours. The separated colours then exit the prism as distinct rays, forming the complete spectrum.",
    "explanation": "Dispersion results from the variation in the refractive index for different wavelengths. The step-by-step process begins with the refraction of the incident light, followed by separation (dispersion) due to varying speeds, and finally the distinct emergence of each colour due to different angles of deviation.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton’s experimental method involved passing a narrow beam of sunlight through a glass prism, which dispersed the light into its constituent colours, forming a spectrum. He then introduced a second, identical prism inverted relative to the first. When the dispersed rays entered this second prism, they were recombined, resulting in the emergence of white light. This experiment was significant because it demonstrated that white light is not a singular entity but a mixture of various colours. The recombination of the spectrum into white light provided strong evidence that colours are inherent components of white light, rather than being produced by the prism itself.",
    "explanation": "Newton’s method first dispersed white light using a prism and then recombined it with an inverted second prism. This clever experimental design eliminated the possibility of the prism creating new colours, instead confirming that white light comprises multiple distinct colours—a fundamental discovery in optics.",
