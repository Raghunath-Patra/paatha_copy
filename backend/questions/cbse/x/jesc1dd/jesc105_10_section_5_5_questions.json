    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Urine formation begins in the kidney with the blood being filtered in the glomerulus, a cluster of capillaries enclosed by Bowman’s capsule. The filtrate, which contains water, glucose, amino acids, salts, and nitrogenous wastes like urea, is collected in Bowman’s capsule. As the filtrate moves through the nephron tubule, essential substances are re-absorbed back into the bloodstream, while excess waste and water continue to form urine. The final urine is directed into the collecting ducts and eventually travels through the ureter to be stored in the urinary bladder until excretion.",
    "explanation": "This process involves several steps: (1) Filtration in the glomerulus, (2) Collection in Bowman’s capsule, (3) Selective reabsorption and secretion in the tubules, and (4) Transportation through the collecting system. Each step is critical for maintaining electrolyte balance and removing wastes from the body.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Unicellular organisms excrete metabolic wastes directly through simple diffusion across their cell membranes due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio. In contrast, multicellular animals rely on specialized organs like kidneys to filter blood and remove waste products efficiently. Plants, on the other hand, utilize processes like transpiration to remove excess water, drop leaves containing accumulated wastes, and sequester wastes in vacuoles or as resins in tissues. While diffusion is sufficient for single cells, the complexity of larger organisms has driven the evolution of organ systems or other mechanisms to manage waste more efficiently.",
    "explanation": "The key differences lie in the mechanisms of waste removal: diffusion is a passive process used by simpler organisms, whereas specialized organs in animals achieve active and regulated waste removal. Plants employ a combination of physical shedding of tissues, storage in vacuoles, and transpiration, reflecting their stationary life style and unique physiology.",

    "correct_answer": "False – Only about 1 to 2 liters of urine are excreted daily, because the majority of the filtrate is re-absorbed in the kidney tubules.",
