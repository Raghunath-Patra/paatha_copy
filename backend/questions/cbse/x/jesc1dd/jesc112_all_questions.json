    "correct_answer": "The magnetic field lines of a bar magnet start from the north pole, curve outward and around, and then enter the south pole. Inside the magnet, the lines continue from the south pole back to the north pole, forming continuous closed loops. The lines are denser near the poles, indicating a stronger magnetic field in these regions.",
    "explanation": "A drawing of magnetic field lines for a bar magnet should include curved lines that start at the north pole (indicating the direction of the magnetic field outside the magnet), and converge at the south pole. Inside the magnet, the field lines run from the south pole back to the north pole. This pattern clearly demonstrates that magnetic fields are continuous (closed curves) and that their density represents the strength of the magnetic field. This is consistent with the pattern shown in Figure 12.4 of the chapter.",

    "correct_answer": "Magnetic field lines have the following properties: They indicate the direction of the magnetic field (the tangent at any point shows the field direction). Outside a magnet, the lines emerge from the north pole and enter the south pole, whereas inside the magnet, they travel from the south pole to the north pole. The lines form continuous closed curves, they do not intersect, and their density indicates the relative strength of the field.",
    "explanation": "Each property of magnetic field lines reinforces our understanding of the magnetic field. The fact that they always form closed loops means that the magnetic field is continuous. Their density being higher near the poles reflects a stronger magnetic field in those regions, and the non-intersecting characteristic ensures that the magnetic field at any given point has one distinct direction. These points help in understanding the behavior of magnets and are consistent with the experimental observations provided in the chapter.",

    "correct_answer": "If two magnetic field lines intersected, it would imply that at the point of intersection the magnetic field has two different directions at the same point, which is physically impossible. A compass needle placed at that point would be forced to align in two distinct directions simultaneously, violating the uniqueness of the magnetic force direction.",
    "explanation": "The uniqueness of the magnetic field direction at any given point is fundamental to the concept of a continuous vector field. Magnetic field lines are merely a mapping tool that represents the direction of the magnetic force. If they intersected, a magnetic dipole (like a compass needle) would not have a unique direction to align with, which contradicts experimental observations and the underlying laws of magnetism.

Place the compass near the north pole of the magnet and note the orientation of its needle. Then, move the compass so that the south end of the needle takes the place where the north end was previously, marking each new position. Connecting these marked points with a smooth curve gives one magnetic field line. Repeat the procedure beginning at different points around the north pole to trace multiple field lines.",
    "explanation": "This activity uses the natural alignment of the compass needle to determine the direction of the magnetic field at various points around the magnet.

    "correct_answer": "The experiment with iron filings involves sprinkling iron filings on a paper with a bar magnet placed underneath. The filings align themselves along the magnetic field lines, visibly tracing out the pattern of the magnetic field. Observations from the experiment include that the filings form curved lines extending from the north pole to the south pole outside the magnet. Additionally, the filings are denser near the poles where the magnetic field is stronger, indicating that the force is higher in those regions. This experiment thus provides a simple and effective visualization of both the direction (indicated by the line curves) and the magnitude (inferred from the density of the filings) of the magnetic field.",
    "explanation": "By using iron filings—which are magnetic particles—the experiment visually represents the invisible magnetic field.

    "explanation": "To determine the current drawn by the oven, use the formula I = P/V where P = 2000 W and V = 220 V. The calculation gives I ≈ 9.09 A. This current far exceeds the circuit rating of 5 A. Domestic circuits are equipped with fuses (or MCBs) to protect against such overloading.

    "explanation": "When an electron beam is deflected, remember that the conventional current direction is opposite to the motion of electrons. With the electron beam moving from back to front, the effective conventional current flows from front to back. Using Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule (with the first finger for the field, second for current, and thumb for force), and given that the force (deflection) is to the right, the magnetic field must be directed downward.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An electric short circuit occurs when the live wire comes into direct contact with the neutral (or earth) wire, resulting in a very low resistance path. This causes an abnormally large current flow which may potentially damage the circuit and connected appliances.",
    "explanation": "Short circuits bypass the normal load by creating a pathway with almost zero resistance between the power source's conductors. The sudden surge in current leads to rapid heating (Joule heating), which can melt wires or blow fuses, thereby disrupting the current flow as a safety measure.",

It is necessary to earth metallic appliances so that in the event of insulation failure or a fault, the leaking current is diverted safely to the ground, reducing the risk of electric shock to the user and triggering protective devices like fuses or circuit breakers.",
    "explanation": "Connecting the metallic parts of an appliance to an earth wire ensures that if there is a fault (for example, if the live wire accidentally contacts the metal casing), the current will flow through the earth wire.

    "correct_answer": "When you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the clockwise current, your thumb points downward. This indicates that the magnetic field inside the loop is directed downward (into the table) while the field lines outside the loop curve around and emerge upward (out of the table).",
    "explanation": "This result follows from the right-hand grip rule. For a current loop, if the fingers follow the current direction, the thumb gives the direction of the magnetic field inside the loop. Outside the loop, the field lines form closed curves, emerging from one side and re-entering on the other, consistent with the field being a vector field.

According to Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, for the given current (flowing from B to A) in an upward magnetic field, the force acts towards the left. Reversing the current reverses the direction of the force, causing the rod to move towards the right.",
    "explanation": "The electromagnetic force acting on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is given by F = I L × B, where I is the current, L is the length vector of the conductor, and B is the magnetic field.

The power is then distributed to separate circuits (often one for heavy appliances like geysers and one for lighter appliances like bulbs and fans) through a distribution box containing a main switch and individual fuses. Safety is enhanced with the incorporation of an earth wire (green) connected to metal plates in the ground, which ensures any leakage current is safely directed away from users.",

    "correct_answer": "The strength of the magnetic field increases with an increase in current. This is observed as a larger deflection in the compass needle when the current in the conductor increases.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The setup involves a battery (12 V), variable resistance (rheostat), an ammeter, a plug key, and a long straight thick copper wire inserted through the center of a fixed rectangular cardboard sheet. Iron filings are sprinkled on the cardboard to visualize the magnetic field. When current flows through the wire, the filings align in concentric circles. Increasing the current (via the rheostat) makes the circles clearer and extends the magnetic field pattern, indicating a stronger field. Moving the compass further from the wire shows reduced deflection, demonstrating that the field strength decreases with distance.",
    "explanation": "This experiment illustrates that a straight current-carrying conductor produces a circular magnetic field. The variation in current alters the magnetic field strength, and the distance effect is evident by the changing deflection of the compass needle. This reinforces the concept of both direct proportionality with current and inverse relation with distance.",

    "correct_answer": "For a horizontal conductor carrying current from east to west, using the right-hand thumb rule, point your thumb towards the west (direction of current). At a point directly above the wire, the fingers will curl such that the magnetic field points towards the north. At a point directly below the wire, the curl of the fingers leads to a magnetic field pointing towards the south. This analysis is valid when considering the perspective from the ends of the conductor.",
    "explanation": "The right-hand thumb rule effectively links the orientation of current to the circular magnetic field surrounding the conductor. By aligning the thumb with the direction of current and examining the curl of the fingers, one can deduce the directions of the magnetic field at various points relative to the wire's position.

Nuclear magnetic resonance is induced and the resulting signals are detected and analyzed to produce detailed images of internal tissues. This technique is based on the fundamental principle that currents (or moving ions) produce magnetic fields, which in turn can influence how nuclei in the body respond to strong magnetic fields.",
    "explanation": "MRI relies on aligning the nuclei in a strong external magnetic field; radiofrequency pulses then disturb this alignment.
