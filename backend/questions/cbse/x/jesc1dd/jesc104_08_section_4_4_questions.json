    "correct_answer": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid because it dissociates completely in water, resulting in a lower pH and a red/orange color with a universal indicator. In contrast, acetic acid (ethanoic acid) is a weak acid; it only partially dissociates in water, leading to a relatively higher pH, which gives a yellow/orange-yellow color with a universal indicator.",

    "correct_answer": "When sodium is added to ethanol, the sodium reacts with the acidic hydrogen of the –OH group to form sodium ethoxide and hydrogen gas, as represented by the equation: 2Na + 2CH₃CH₂OH → 2CH₃CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂. The evolution of hydrogen gas is confirmed using the burning splinter test, which produces a characteristic 'pop' sound upon combustion. This experiment illustrates the weak acidic nature of the alcoholic hydroxyl group. In real-world applications, this reaction helps in understanding the reactivity of alcohols with metals and showcases fundamental concepts in reaction mechanisms and organic synthesis.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To differentiate between HCl and acetic acid, take equal volumes of each acid and first test with red litmus paper. Both acids will turn the red litmus paper blue, indicating their acidic nature. Next, add a few drops of universal indicator to separate samples of each acid. Hydrochloric acid, being a strong acid, will exhibit a deep red or orange color (indicating a low pH), while acetic acid will show a lighter yellow or orange-yellow color (indicating a higher pH). This difference in color intensity demonstrates that HCl is a strong acid that completely dissociates in water, whereas acetic acid is a weak acid with partial dissociation.",
    "explanation": "Litmus paper merely indicates the acidic environment, but the universal indicator provides a graded pH response, revealing differences in acid strength. This experiment highlights the importance of using quantitative indicators to analyze pH differences in chemical solutions.",
