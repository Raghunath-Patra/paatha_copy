    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process begins with chemical reactions that replicate the DNA, resulting in two copies of the genetic material within the cell. Alongside the replication of DNA, a new cellular apparatus is also created so that each daughter cell can function independently. DNA serves as the blueprint for protein synthesis, meaning that any changes in the DNA can alter the proteins produced and, consequently, the organism’s body design. Although the replication process is highly coordinated, the biochemical reactions involved are not completely error-free, allowing for slight variations between the copies. These variations, while sometimes detrimental, can be neutral or even beneficial, and are the foundation of evolutionary change.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines that DNA replication is coupled with the creation of cellular structures and emphasizes the importance of DNA in coding for proteins. It also explains that the error-prone nature of replication introduces genetic variation, which is essential for evolution.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Environmental changes like global warming can drastically alter the conditions of a niche, making it hostile to organisms that are not suited for the new conditions. In a population of bacteria adapted to temperate waters, most individuals might not survive a significant temperature rise. However, genetic variations resulting from minor errors during DNA replication could produce some bacteria with traits that confer heat resistance. These bacteria have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing in warmer conditions, leading to a shift in the population's genetic makeup—this is a clear example of natural selection driven by environmental change.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains the concept of natural selection where genetic variation within a population provides the raw material for evolution. It shows how a shift in environmental conditions, such as an increase in water temperature, can select for individuals with beneficial mutations (heat resistance), ensuring species survival.",

    "correct_answer": "Errors during DNA replication create variations among daughter cells. While many errors may result in non-functional proteins leading to cell death or dysfunction, some errors can produce beneficial traits by altering protein structure in a way that improves an organism's adaptability. Beneficial mutations may offer enhanced survival traits in a changing environment, while detrimental ones are generally eliminated through natural selection. This balance between harmful and advantageous mutations is central to evolutionary processes, as it allows populations to evolve over time in response to environmental pressures.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that the inherent inaccuracy of DNA replication is a double-edged sword—it can lead to detrimental outcomes but also produces the genetic diversity necessary for evolution.
