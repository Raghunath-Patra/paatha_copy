(b) Since the acid responsible for curdling is neutralised, the pH does not drop to the level needed for rapid curd formation, delaying the curdling process.",
    "explanation": "Baking soda (NaHCO₃) reacts with any acidic components in the milk to form neutral salts, reducing the overall acidity. A lower concentration of free lactic acid slows down the process of curd formation, thereby increasing the shelf life of the milk.",
