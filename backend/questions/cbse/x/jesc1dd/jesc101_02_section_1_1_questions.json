    ],
    "correct_answer": "Iron, because it occurs in the complex compound Fe₃O₄ where three Fe atoms are present. Starting with the element that appears with a higher count in one compound often makes balancing more straightforward.",
    "explanation": "Since iron (Fe) appears as a single atom on the reactant side but three atoms in Fe₃O₄ on the product side, balancing it first helps set the stage for balancing other elements; hence, beginning with Fe is effective.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Step I: Draw boxes around each formula to avoid modifying any compound inadvertently. Step II: Count the number of atoms for each element on both sides of the equation. Step III: Choose an element that appears in the most complex compound (Fe in Fe₃O₄) and balance it first. Step IV: Adjust coefficients for water (H₂O) to balance oxygen atoms. Step V: Rebalance hydrogen atoms by adjusting the coefficient for H₂. Step VI: Finally, return to balance any remaining elements, in this case, iron. Each step is critical because it systematically ensures that all elements obey the law of conservation of mass, resulting in a fully balanced equation.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One systematic method is the algebraic method, where unknown coefficients are assigned to each compound and simultaneous equations are formed based on the conservation of atoms for each element. Compared to the hit-and-trial method, the algebraic method reduces guesswork and can be more efficient for very complex equations. However, it may require solving multiple equations which can be mathematically intensive. The hit-and-trial method is more straightforward and intuitive for simpler reactions but can become cumbersome and time-consuming when handling complex reactions with many elements.",
    "explanation": "The algebraic method offers a structured approach suited well for complicated balancing tasks by turning the balancing process into a set of linear equations, whereas the hit-and-trial method relies on intuition and iterative adjustments. Each method has its own merits depending on the complexity of the reaction and the user's comfort with mathematical procedures.",
