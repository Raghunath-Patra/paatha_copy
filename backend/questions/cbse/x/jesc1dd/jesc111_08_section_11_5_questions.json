    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The material of a conductor determines its inherent ability to conduct electricity, represented by its resistivity (ρ). Materials with low resistivity, like copper, allow more current to flow, whereas those with high resistivity restrict the current flow. Electrical appliances such as electric heaters require a large amount of heat production, which is achieved by converting electrical energy into thermal energy. A material with a higher resistivity (and therefore higher resistance for given dimensions) will produce more heat when a current passes through, making it suitable for heating applications.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ohm's law states that I = V/R, where I is the current, V is the voltage, and R is the resistance of the conductor. When replacing one conductor with another, the resistance changes due to differences in length, cross-sectional area, and resistivity. For example, if a conductor's length is doubled or its material has higher resistivity, its resistance increases, resulting in a lower current for the same voltage. Conversely, if the cross-sectional area increases or a material with lower resistivity is used, the resistance decreases, causing an increase in the current. The procedure involves: (1) determining the new resistance using R = ρ * (l/A), (2) substituting this resistance into Ohm's law, and (3) calculating the new current.",

    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed by setting up a circuit that includes a metal wire (of known dimensions) connected to a constant voltage source and an ammeter to measure current. The wire can be placed in a temperature-controlled environment (using a water bath or furnace) where its temperature can be varied systematically. The variables to be controlled include the applied voltage, length, and cross-sectional area of the wire, while temperature is varied. Data are recorded for the current at different temperatures. According to the temperature dependence of resistivity, as temperature increases, the resistivity (and thus resistance) of a metal typically increases, leading to a decrease in current. The experiment should include a calibration step and account for possible heat losses.",
