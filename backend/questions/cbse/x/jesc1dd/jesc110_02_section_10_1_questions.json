    "correct_answer": "Accommodation is the process by which the eye adjusts its focal length by changing the curvature of the crystalline lens, enabling us to see objects clearly at different distances.",

    "correct_answer": "The near point, also known as the least distance of distinct vision, is the closest distance at which an object can be seen clearly, typically around 25 cm in a normal eye. The far point is the farthest distance at which objects can be seen clearly, which for a normal eye is at infinity.",
    "explanation": "These parameters define the range within which the eye can focus images sharply. The near point is limited by the minimum focal length the lens can achieve, and the far point is defined by the eye's ability to relax its focus for distant objects.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When light enters the eye, it first passes through the cornea where most initial refraction occurs. It then travels through the pupil, the size of which is regulated by the iris to control the light intensity. The light is further focused by the crystalline lens, which adjusts its curvature (through accommodation) to focus the image sharply on the retina. The retina, packed with photoreceptor cells, converts the focused light into electrical signals. These signals are sent via the optic nerve to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as coherent visual images.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The eye’s power of accommodation is achieved by the crystalline lens changing its curvature under the influence of the ciliary muscles. When viewing objects that are near, the ciliary muscles contract, causing the lens to become thicker and more curved, which decreases its focal length to focus the image on the retina. However, the lens cannot become infinitely curved. There is a minimum focal length below which clear vision is not possible, which is why objects held closer than about 25 cm appear blurred and can cause eye strain.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines how the physical adjustment of the lens helps in focusing on objects at various distances and emphasizes the limitation imposed by the minimum achievable focal length. It connects the physiological changes in the lens with the perceptual experience of clarity and strain.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Cataract is the clouding or opacification of the crystalline lens, often due to aging or other risk factors, which interferes with the passage of light to the retina. This results in blurred or diminished vision. Cataract surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and usually replacing it with an artificial intraocular lens, thereby restoring the clarity of the visual image.",
    "explanation": "This response explains that cataract is a degenerative condition affecting the lens, leading to impaired vision. The surgical treatment, which is a widely adopted clinical procedure, effectively restores vision by removing the source of the opacity and replacing it with a clear, artificial lens.",
