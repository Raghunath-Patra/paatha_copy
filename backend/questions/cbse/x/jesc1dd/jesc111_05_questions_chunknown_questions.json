    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A cell or a battery.",
    "explanation": "A cell or battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy, maintaining a potential difference across its terminals even when no external load is connected. This potential difference is crucial in initiating and sustaining the flow of electric charge in a circuit.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "It means that 1 Joule of work is done in moving 1 Coulomb of electric charge between the two points.",
    "explanation": "The potential difference is defined as the work done per unit charge (V = W/Q). Thus, when the potential difference is 1 volt, it implies that moving 1 Coulomb of charge from one point to another requires 1 Joule of work.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "6 Joules",
    "explanation": "Using the relationship between potential difference and energy (E = V Ã— Q), where V is the potential difference (6 V) and Q is the charge (1 C), the energy imparted to each coulomb of charge is 6 Joules. This means each coulomb gains 6 J of energy as it passes through the battery.",
