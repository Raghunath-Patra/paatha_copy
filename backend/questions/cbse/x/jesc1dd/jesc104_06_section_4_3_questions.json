    "correct_answer": "Alcohol (Ethanol). When ethanol burns, it undergoes complete combustion producing a blue flame with little to no soot.",
    "explanation": "Ethanol is a saturated compound that burns completely under sufficient oxygen, leading to a blue, non-sooty flame. In contrast, camphor and naphthalene burn with yellow, sooty flames due to incomplete combustion.",

    "correct_answer": "CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O. This reaction is balanced because one mole of methane reacts with two moles of oxygen to produce one mole of carbon dioxide and two moles of water.",

    "correct_answer": "Saturated hydrocarbons contain only single bonds, which means their combustion process is typically complete when sufficient oxygen is available. This complete combustion produces mainly CO₂ and H₂O, resulting in a clean blue flame with minimal soot production.",
    "explanation": "Because saturated hydrocarbons do not have extra carbon–carbon double bonds, they burn uniformly in oxygen. The complete conversion of fuel into carbon dioxide and water leads to the emission of blue light characteristic of high-temperature, efficient combustion.",

    "explanation": "In this reaction, KMnO₄ oxidizes ethanol by adding oxygen to it. The purple color of KMnO₄ disappears as it reacts with ethanol, and once all ethanol is oxidized, any additional KMnO₄ will remain purple, indicating that the oxidation is complete.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hydrogenation is an addition reaction where hydrogen (H₂) is added to the double bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel. The general representation of the reaction is: RCH=CHR + H₂ → RCH₂–CH₂R. During this reaction, the unsaturated bonds convert into saturated bonds. In the context of vegetable oils, which are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, hydrogenation converts them into more saturated fats. This process alters their physical state and improves shelf life, although it may also impact health benefits by increasing the saturated fat content.",
    "explanation": "Hydrogenation involves the addition of hydrogen atoms across the double bonds of unsaturated compounds. The catalyst, often nickel, facilitates this process by adsorbing both the hydrogen gas and the fatty acid molecules onto its surface, thus lowering the activation energy. This process is widely used in the food industry to solidify vegetable oils, although it can lead to the formation of trans fats if not carefully controlled.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The nature of a bunsen burner flame is highly dependent on the amount of oxygen available during combustion. When the air hole at the base of the bunsen burner is fully open, there is a sufficient supply of oxygen which supports complete combustion. Complete combustion results in a blue, non-luminous flame because the fuel burns completely into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O), with minimal soot production. Conversely, when the air hole is partially closed, the limited oxygen supply leads to incomplete combustion. Incomplete combustion produces unburnt carbon particles that glow, causing a yellow, sooty, and luminous flame. The deposition of soot is a clear indication of the presence of unoxidized carbon.",
    "explanation": "Controlled oxygen supply directly impacts the efficiency and temperature of the combustion reaction. A flame with excess oxygen ensures all carbon in the fuel is oxidized, resulting in a blue flame. Reduced oxygen supply leads to partial oxidation, where carbon particles do not burn entirely, emitting yellow light as they glow due to incandescence. This experiment illustrates the importance of proper air-fuel mixtures in combustion devices, such as gas stoves to prevent fuel wastage and soot formation.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Incomplete combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of harmful by-products into the environment. When fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum do not combust completely, significant amounts of soot (black carbon) are produced, which can contribute to air pollution and respiratory problems. Additionally, impurities in fossil fuels, including nitrogen and sulphur, form nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and sulphur oxides (SOₓ) during combustion. These oxides are major pollutants that lead to smog formation, acid rain, and contribute to global atmospheric changes. The emission of these pollutants from power plants, vehicles, and other combustion engines has significant adverse effects on both public health and the environment.",
    "explanation": "Incomplete combustion results in lower combustion temperatures and inefficient burning of fuel, resulting in the formation of particulate matter and various gaseous pollutants. The presence of elements like sulphur and nitrogen in fossil fuels further exacerbates the environmental impact by creating acid rain and contributing to respiratory disorders in humans. These issues underline the importance of optimizing combustion processes and transitioning to cleaner energy sources to reduce environmental harm.",
