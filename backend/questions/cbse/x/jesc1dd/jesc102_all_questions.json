This difference in odour allows even visually impaired students to identify whether a solution is acidic or basic.",
    "explanation": "The experiments described show that after treating the olfactory indicator substrates with an acid (like HCl), the characteristic odour remains consistent, whereas exposure to a base (like NaOH) leads to a significant change or loss of the smell.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To determine whether an unknown solution is acidic or basic, first prepare a series of indicator tests. Step 1: Using visual indicators, add a drop of red and blue litmus: if red remains unchanged and blue turns red, the solution is acidic; if red turns blue and blue remains unchanged, it is basic. Step 2: Add a few drops of phenolphthalein: a pink coloration indicates a basic solution, while its absence indicates an acidic or neutral solution. Step 3: For olfactory testing, use cloth strips impregnated with onion, vanilla, or clove oil. Observe whether their natural odour is preserved (acidic) or diminished (basic). Based on these multiple tests, if all visual and olfactory indicators point to the same pH behavior, the identity of the unknown solution can be confidently confirmed.",
    "explanation": "This procedure combines multiple techniques to reduce error. Visual indicators like litmus and phenolphthalein provide immediate color changes, while olfactory indicators give additional confirmation by the change in characteristic smells.

This is because the dissolution process is exothermic, releasing a significant amount of heat. Safety precautions include wearing protective gear (gloves, goggles), working in a well-ventilated area, and using a container that can withstand thermal stress. The exothermic nature arises due to the strong interaction between the acid and water molecules, where water molecules hydrate the H⁺ ions, releasing energy.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The pH of a salt solution is determined by the relative strengths of the acid and base from which the salt is formed. Salts derived from strong acids and strong bases (e.g., NaCl from HCl and NaOH) are neutral as neither ion hydrolyzes in water. In contrast, salts from strong acids and weak bases (e.g., NH₄Cl from HCl and NH₄OH, or AlCl₃ from HCl and Al(OH)₃) produce an acidic solution because the weak base does not fully neutralize the acid’s effect. Conversely, salts formed from weak acids and strong bases (e.g., sodium acetate from CH₃COOH and NaOH) yield basic solutions as the weak acid does not impart significant acidity, and the strong base’s conjugate ion undergoes hydrolysis to form OH⁻ ions.",
    "explanation": "The concept of hydrolysis is central here: when a salt dissolves, its ions may react with water. If the anion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will react with water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic. Similarly, if the cation is the conjugate acid of a weak base, it tends to generate H⁺ ions, making the solution acidic.

    "correct_answer": "Yes, basic solutions do contain H⁺(aq) ions, but they are classified as basic because the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) is significantly higher than the concentration of hydrogen ions, shifting the equilibrium of water (H₂O) toward more OH⁻. This imbalance is consistent with the ion product constant for water (K₍w₎ = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).",
    "explanation": "Even in basic solutions, water undergoes autoionization, producing a small amount of H⁺ ions. However, in a basic solution the dominant species are OH⁻ ions.

    "explanation": "When concentrated acid is diluted, a significant amount of heat is released. If water is added to the acid, the localized concentration of acid can cause a rapid temperature rise, leading to dangerous splashing and potential burns.

    "correct_answer": "A universal indicator is a mixture of several pH-sensitive dyes. It changes colour depending on the pH of the solution it is added to. By comparing the observed colour with a standard colour chart, one can estimate the pH of the solution, thereby indicating whether it is acidic, neutral, or basic.",
    "explanation": "The universal indicator provides a simple and quick method to visually assess the pH of a solution. The colour changes result from the indicator dyes undergoing molecular structure changes in response to different hydrogen ion concentrations.",

    "correct_answer": "Strong acids ionise completely in water, releasing a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺), while weak acids only partially ionise, resulting in a lower concentration of H⁺ ions. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, whereas acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid.",
    "explanation": "The extent of ionisation determines the acid strength. Complete ionisation in strong acids leads to a lower pH for the same concentration compared to weak acids.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Activity 2.11, students test various solutions by dipping universal indicator paper into each sample. The paper changes colour based on the hydrogen ion (H⁺) or hydroxide ion (OH⁻) concentration of the solution. These colours are then compared to a reference chart to assign approximate pH values. For example, a lower pH (e.g., ~2.2 for lemon juice) signifies high H⁺ concentration, indicating a strong acid, while a higher pH (e.g., ~14 for 1M NaOH) indicates a strong base. This process demonstrates that the magnitude of ionisation directly relates to the acid or base strength.",
    "explanation": "The procedure reinforces the concept that pH is a quantitative measure of H⁺ concentration. A solution's pH value reflects its corrosiveness or neutralising capacity, making it a critical parameter in both scientific experiments and real-world applications such as environmental monitoring and gastroenterology.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "pH is critical in everyday life as it affects both environmental and human biological systems. In aquatic ecosystems, a sudden drop in pH, such as from acid rain (pH < 5.6), can reduce water quality and threaten aquatic life by disrupting physiological processes. In human health, the body requires a near-neutral pH (~7.0) for optimal function. The digestive system uses hydrochloric acid for digestion, but excess acid can lead to conditions like indigestion, addressed with antacids like milk of magnesia. Moreover, dental enamel is vulnerable to decay when mouth pH drops below 5.5, so maintaining a near-neutral mouth environment is essential for preventing tooth decay. Thus, monitoring and regulating pH is vital for environmental protection and maintaining human health.",

    "correct_answer": "The experiment would involve collecting soil samples from several locations in the garden or field. For each sample, weigh about 2 g of soil and add 5 mL of distilled water in a test tube. Shake well and filter the mixture to obtain the soil filtrate. Use universal indicator paper to measure the pH of the filtrate and record the corresponding colour and pH value. Parallely, document the type of plants growing in each location. Analyze the collected data to correlate the observed soil pH with the health and growth of the plants. By plotting soil pH against plant performance indicators (like leaf colour, growth rate, fruit yield), determine the range of pH that optimally supports healthy plant growth.",
