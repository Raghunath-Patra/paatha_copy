In contrast, detergents do not form such precipitates because their charged groups do not interact with these ions, so they remain effective in hard water.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Micelles form when soap molecules aggregate in water with their hydrophobic tails pointing inward and their hydrophilic heads pointing outward. When cleaning an oil-contaminated surface, these hydrophobic tails attach to the oil. The aggregation of many soap molecules results in a spherical micelle that encases the oil droplet in its center, allowing the oil to be suspended in water and rinsed away.",
    "explanation": "The cleaning process relies on the dual nature of soap molecules. The hydrophobic part interacts with oil, while the hydrophilic part keeps the micelle soluble in water. This entrapment of oil in micelles makes it possible to wash away greasy dirt and oil, illustrating a prime example of how amphiphilic molecules facilitate cleaning.",

    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed using two sets of test tubes filled with identical volumes (e.g., 10 mL) of hard water. In one set, add a fixed number of drops of soap solution; in the other, add an equal number of drops of detergent solution. Shake both sets vigorously for the same amount of time and observe the formation of foam and any precipitate (scum). Control variables including water volume, drop count, shaking time, and ambient temperature. Expected observations are that detergent solutions will produce more foam without scum formation, while the soap solutions will produce less foam with visible white precipitate due to the reaction with calcium and magnesium ions.",
    "explanation": "The design controls all variables except the cleaning agent. By comparing the foam and precipitate formation, the efficiency of soap versus detergent in hard water can be assessed.
