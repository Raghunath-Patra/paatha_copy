    "question_text": "When a ray of light travels from a rarer medium (e.g., air) to a denser medium (e.g., water), how does its path change relative to the normal at the interface?",
    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": [
      "A. It bends away from the normal",
      "B. It bends towards the normal",
      "C. It continues in the same line",
      "D. It gets completely reflected"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B. It bends towards the normal. When light enters a denser medium, its speed decreases, causing it to bend towards the normal line at the point of incidence.",
    "explanation": "When light travels from a rarer medium (lower refractive index) to a denser medium (higher refractive index), its speed decreases. According to Snellâ€™s law, this change in speed causes the light ray to bend towards the normal.",
