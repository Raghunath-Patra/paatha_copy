    "correct_answer": "B) Free earlobes are dominant over attached earlobes.",
    "explanation": "The activity suggests that if a child inherits the free earlobe trait from one parent, it is typically expressed, indicating that the free earlobe is the dominant trait compared to the attached type, which is recessive (expressed only when both alleles are for attached earlobes).",

    "correct_answer": "Germ cells are produced via meiosis, a cell division process that halves the number of chromosomes so that each germ cell contains one complete set. During fertilization, the merging of two germ cells (one from each parent) restores the diploid chromosome number, thus ensuring genetic stability across generations.",

    "correct_answer": "A dihybrid cross between two heterozygous pea plants (e.g., RrYy) shows that the genes controlling two traits segregate independently, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. This independent assortment means that the inheritance of one trait does not affect the inheritance of another, leading to new trait combinations in the offspring.",
    "explanation": "The 9:3:3:1 ratio arises because the alleles for each trait are segregated into gametes randomly, and the formation of each gamete is independent of the other. This principle underlies much of modern genetics and is a key finding from Mendel’s experiments.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Mendel’s experiments with pea plants demonstrated that traits are inherited as discrete units. In monohybrid crosses, where one trait was observed (e.g., tall vs. short), crossing a homozygous dominant plant with a homozygous recessive plant resulted in all dominant-phenotype offspring in the F1 generation. However, self-pollinating these F1 plants produced an F2 generation with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio, indicating the segregation of alleles. In dihybrid crosses involving two traits (such as seed shape and color), the F1 generation exhibited the dominant traits, while the F2 generation exhibited a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. The appearance of these predictable ratios led Mendel to formulate his laws of segregation and independent assortment.",
    "explanation": "This answer highlights how counting and classifying offspring allowed Mendel to infer that alleles segregate during gamete formation (law of segregation) and that different traits are passed on independently of one another (law of independent assortment).",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Trait expression is governed by genes that encode proteins such as enzymes. In the case of plant height, a gene codes for an enzyme involved in synthesizing a growth hormone. If the gene produces an efficient enzyme, it results in abundant hormone production and a tall phenotype. Conversely, if a mutation produces a less efficient enzyme, less hormone is synthesized, leading to a short plant. This molecular mechanism explains how variations in a single gene can affect the overall phenotype.",

    "correct_answer": "First, identify two pure-breeding (homozygous) lines that contrast clearly in the trait of interest. Cross these two lines to produce an F1 generation. If all F1 offspring display the same phenotype, that phenotype is likely dominant. To confirm, allow the F1 plants to self-pollinate to produce an F2 generation. Analyze the phenotypic ratios in F2; a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive) suggests Mendelian inheritance of a single trait with dominant and recessive alleles. Additionally, performing test crosses between F1 individuals and homozygous recessive plants can help determine if the F1 individuals are heterozygous or homozygous dominant based on the ratio of offspring phenotypes.",
    "explanation": "This experimental design utilizes both the F1 generation analysis and the test cross method to clearly determine the mode of inheritance.
