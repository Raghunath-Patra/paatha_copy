    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Myopia is characterized by the image of a distant object being formed in front of the retina and is corrected with a concave lens. Hypermetropia occurs when the image of a near object forms behind the retina, requiring a convex lens for correction. Presbyopia is an age-related reduction in the eye's accommodation power, causing difficulty with near vision due to the weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminished lens flexibility, and is also corrected using convex lenses or bifocal lenses when combined with other defects.",
    "explanation": "Each refractive defect has a unique mechanism: Myopia has a shortened focal distance leading to a closer far point; hypermetropia has a lengthened focal distance leading to a receded near point; and presbyopia is due to reduced lens flexibility with age. The corresponding corrective measures involve diverging rays in myopia using concave lenses, converging rays in hypermetropia with convex lenses, and sometimes a combination for presbyopia.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Corrective lenses work on the principle of refraction, which is the bending of light rays when they pass through materials of different refractive indices. In refractive errors like myopia and hypermetropia, the image of an object is formed either in front of or behind the retina due to the eye's shape or lens curvature. A concave lens in myopia diverges incoming light rays, moving the image formation onto the retina, while a convex lens in hypermetropia converges the diverging rays so they focus correctly. In daily life, these corrections allow individuals to see clearly, thereby enhancing quality of life, productivity, and school or work performance, and reducing accidents due to poor vision.",
    "explanation": "The corrective lens adjusts the path of light before it reaches the eye, thereby compensating for the abnormal focusing power of the defective eye. This principle continues to have wide applications, including modern contact lenses and surgical interventions, ultimately contributing significantly to improved vision and overall life quality.",
