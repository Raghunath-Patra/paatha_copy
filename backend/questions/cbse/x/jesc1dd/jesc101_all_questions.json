    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the electrolysis of water, dilute sulphuric acid is added to enhance conductivity by providing ions. When an electric current is passed through the water, water molecules decompose into hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode. The volume of hydrogen collected is approximately double that of oxygen, consistent with the stoichiometric ratio in the equation: 2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g). Identification of the gases is confirmed experimentally—the gas at the cathode burns with a ‘pop’ sound (confirming hydrogen), while the gas at the anode supports combustion (confirming oxygen).",
    "explanation": "The dilute acid acts as an electrolyte, providing ions that facilitate the flow of current. The 2:1 volume ratio of hydrogen to oxygen directly reflects the balanced chemical equation for water decomposition.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reaction of calcium oxide with water is exothermic, meaning it releases energy in the form of heat, which is evident by the warmth of the beaker. This release of energy indicates that bond formation (in converting CaO and H₂O to Ca(OH)₂) is energetically favorable. In contrast, the reaction between barium hydroxide and ammonium chloride is endothermic—it absorbs heat, making the test tube cold. This indicates that energy is required to break the existing bonds and form new ones, resulting in a net absorption of energy from the surroundings.",
    "explanation": "Exothermic reactions release heat because the energy released during bond formation exceeds the energy required to break bonds, whereas endothermic reactions require energy input because bond breaking consumes more energy than is released during the formation of new bonds.

Similarly, the decomposition of lead nitrate is used to produce lead oxide, an important compound in the production of batteries and glass. However, these processes present environmental and safety concerns: the decomposition of calcium carbonate releases CO₂, a greenhouse gas, and the decomposition of lead nitrate produces toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and lead compounds, which pose health and environmental hazards if not properly managed.",

When the iron nail is dipped into the solution, iron reacts with Cu²⁺ ions to form pale green iron(II) sulphate, while metallic copper, which is reddish-brown, is deposited. This causes the original blue colour of the copper sulphate solution to fade.",
    "explanation": "This is a single replacement (redox) reaction where iron, being more reactive than copper, displaces copper from the compound. The copper ions (Cu²⁺) are removed from the solution as they precipitate out in metallic form, and the newly formed iron(II) sulphate imparts a pale green colour.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One systematic method is the algebraic method, where unknown coefficients are assigned to each compound and simultaneous equations are formed based on the conservation of atoms for each element. Compared to the hit-and-trial method, the algebraic method reduces guesswork and can be more efficient for very complex equations. However, it may require solving multiple equations which can be mathematically intensive. The hit-and-trial method is more straightforward and intuitive for simpler reactions but can become cumbersome and time-consuming when handling complex reactions with many elements.",
    "explanation": "The algebraic method offers a structured approach suited well for complicated balancing tasks by turning the balancing process into a set of linear equations, whereas the hit-and-trial method relies on intuition and iterative adjustments. Each method has its own merits depending on the complexity of the reaction and the user's comfort with mathematical procedures.",

    "correct_answer": "Inclusion of physical state symbols such as (s), (l), (g), and (aq) clarifies whether substances are in a solid, liquid, gas, or aqueous phase. For example, in the reaction 3Fe(s) + 4H₂O(g) → Fe₃O₄(s) + 4H₂(g), stating that water is in the gaseous state (steam) is important for understanding the thermal conditions required for the reaction. Omitting these symbols might lead to the misconception that water is liquid, which could change the interpretation of the reaction conditions and energy changes involved.",

    "explanation": "During the electrolysis of water, water decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen gas. According to the equation 2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g), for every two molecules of water, two molecules of hydrogen gas and one molecule of oxygen gas are produced.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Oxidation in fats and oils is a free radical chain reaction that begins with the initiation phase, where fatty acids lose a hydrogen atom to form a radical. This is followed by the propagation phase, during which the radical reacts with oxygen to form peroxy radicals and hydroperoxides. Finally, in the termination phase, these radicals combine to form non-radical products. The hydroperoxides can decompose to form aldehydes, ketones, and shorter chain fatty acids, which are responsible for the off-flavors and odors observed in rancid fats.",
    "explanation": "This multi-step process involves radical formation, reaction with molecular oxygen, and subsequent decomposition to various compounds.
