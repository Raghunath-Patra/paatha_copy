In unicellular organisms, such as yeast and amoeba, budding and binary fission occur, producing genetically identical daughter cells. In simple multicellular organisms like Spirogyra, fragmentation allows a broken piece to grow into a complete organism. Regeneration, seen in organisms like Hydra and Planaria, involves the reformation of an entire organism from a body part using specialist regenerative cells.",
    "explanation": "The answer outlines that budding (e.g., yeast), binary fission (e.g., amoeba), fragmentation (e.g., Spirogyra), and regeneration (e.g., Hydra) are all asexual methods. They differ mainly in the complexity of the organism and the specific mechanisms used to produce the offspring.

    "correct_answer": "Tissue culture involves isolating cells or tissues from a plant, placing them in an artificial medium where they form a callus, and then transferring this callus to another medium with specific hormones for differentiation into plantlets. Advantages over seed propagation include faster production, uniformity in the offspring, and the ability to produce disease-free plants even when seeds are not viable.",
    "explanation": "The process starts with the selection and sterilization of plant tissue, then placement in a nutrient medium to initiate cell division. After callus formation, the cells are exposed to hormones that promote root and shoot differentiation. Finally, developed plantlets are acclimatized and transferred to soil. This method also allows the propagation of plants that are difficult to grow from seeds, ensuring rapid and uniform production.",

    "correct_answer": "Multiple fission in Plasmodium involves the repeated division of the nucleus within a single cell, followed by the gathering of the cytoplasmic material around each nucleus to form multiple daughter cells (merozoites). This process is significant because it leads to the rapid multiplication of the parasite in the host, intensifying the infection and increasing the chances of transmission. ",
    "explanation": "The answer should detail that, unlike binary fission, multiple fission produces many daughter cells simultaneously in one cycle, thereby exponentially increasing the parasite population. The release of numerous merozoites upon rupture of the parent cell contributes to the severity of malaria by accelerating the infection process and challenging the host’s immune response.",
