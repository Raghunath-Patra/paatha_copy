Their thin walls and extensive network of capillaries ensure that oxygen diffuses efficiently into the blood and carbon dioxide is expelled.",
    "explanation": "The structural design of alveoli—with a large total surface area (approximately 80 m²), thin walls, and close proximity to capillaries—facilitates rapid diffusion of gases, making the respiratory process efficient.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen, taking place in the mitochondria. The complete oxidation of glucose yields carbon dioxide, water, and a high amount of energy (ATP). The balanced equation is: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + energy. Anaerobic respiration occurs when oxygen is limited. In yeast, for example, glucose is partially broken down to produce carbon dioxide and ethanol (fermentation), while in human muscle cells, it results in the production of lactic acid. The energy yield in anaerobic respiration is significantly lower than in aerobic respiration.",
    "explanation": "Aerobic respiration fully oxidizes glucose using oxygen, yielding maximal ATP, whereas anaerobic respiration provides a short-term energy alternative when oxygen is scarce, leading to by-products like ethanol or lactic acid.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Aquatic animals, like fish, have evolved gills that allow them to extract dissolved oxygen from water, which contains much lower oxygen levels compared to air. The process involves coordinated movements of the mouth and operculum (gill covers) to ensure a continuous flow of water over the gills. Terrestrial animals, on the other hand, have lungs with structures such as alveoli that provide a large surface area for gas exchange. These adaptations ensure that, despite the lower oxygen content in water or the challenges of maintaining moist surfaces in the air, each animal efficiently acquires the oxygen required for metabolism.",
    "explanation": "The structural and functional design of fish gills—including their high ventilation rates and thin membranes—compensates for the low concentration of oxygen in water. Terrestrial animals benefit from the direct access to atmospheric oxygen and extensive alveolar surfaces. These differences illustrate how evolutionary pressures have shaped respiratory systems to meet environmental demands.",
