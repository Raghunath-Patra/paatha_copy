    "correct_answer": "C. Cross-pollination leads to greater genetic variation than self-pollination. Explanation: Cross-pollination involves the transfer of pollen from one flower to another, combining genetic material from different individuals.",

    "correct_answer": "C. To reduce the chromosome number by half, ensuring consistent genetic material in offspring. Explanation: Meiosis halves the genetic content so that when gametes fuse, the original chromosome number is restored.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "DNA replication mechanisms, while highly accurate, do introduce occasional errors (mutations) during copying. When combined with the recombination events that occur during meiosis, these mutations—along with the diverse genetic contributions from two different individuals—create new and unique genetic combinations in the resulting zygote.",
    "explanation": "The slight inaccuracies in DNA replication can lead to mutations that become a source of genetic variation. Additionally, during meiosis, crossing-over exchanges genetic material between homologous chromosomes. When gametes from two different individuals fuse during fertilization, these unique combinations enhance the genetic diversity of the offspring, which is beneficial for the species' ability to adapt.",

    "correct_answer": "The human male reproductive system comprises the testes (which produce sperm and secrete testosterone), the vas deferens (which transports sperm from the testes), and accessory glands such as the prostate and seminal vesicles that secrete fluids to nourish and facilitate the movement of sperm. Together, these structures ensure the production, maturation, and delivery of sperm during the reproductive process.",
    "explanation": "Testes are located in the scrotum, an environment with a slightly lower temperature ideal for sperm production. The vas deferens carries mature sperm to the urethra, where fluids from the prostate and seminal vesicles mix with the sperm. These secretions provide energy, aid in motility, and protect sperm during their journey toward the female reproductive tract for fertilization.",

    "correct_answer": "Reproductive health challenges include the spread of STDs such as HIV-AIDS, gonorrhea, and syphilis, as well as the potential for unintended pregnancies. Preventative strategies involve using mechanical barriers (e.g., condoms), hormonal contraceptives (e.g., pills, patches), intrauterine devices (IUDs), and even surgical methods (e.g., vasectomy, tubal ligation). Each method carries its own advantages and potential side effects.",
    "explanation": "Sexual contact can facilitate the transmission of infections due to close physical contact. Condoms help minimize this risk by physically blocking the transfer of bodily fluids. Hormonal contraceptives prevent ovulation, while IUDs create an inhospitable environment for sperm. Surgical methods offer permanent solutions but come with risks such as infections.
