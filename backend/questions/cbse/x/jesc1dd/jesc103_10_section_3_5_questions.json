    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "Rust formation in iron involves a redox reaction where iron reacts with oxygen and water to form iron hydroxides that further dehydrate to form rust. The simplified reaction is: 4Fe + 3O₂ + 6H₂O → 4Fe(OH)₃, which then converts to Fe₂O₃·nH₂O (rust). Key environmental conditions include the presence of both moisture and oxygen. Higher humidity and the presence of electrolytes can accelerate the process.",
    "explanation": "This process is a series of oxidation reactions where iron loses electrons to oxygen. The presence of water facilitates ion movement, making the prolonged exposure of iron to a moist environment particularly conducive to corrosion.",

    "correct_answer": "Alloying involves mixing iron with other elements to alter and improve its properties. For instance, adding a small amount of carbon (about 0.05%) to iron produces steel, which is significantly stronger than pure iron. Additionally, when iron is alloyed with nickel and chromium, it produces stainless steel, which resists rusting and is widely used in kitchenware, architecture, and medical instruments.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One experimental design would involve placing identical iron nails in several tightly sealed containers, each maintained at a different level of humidity (for example, 20%, 50%, and 80%) using humidifiers and dehumidifiers. All other factors such as temperature, volume of water (if added), and exposure to oxygen should be kept constant. Controls should include a container with standard laboratory conditions. The expected result is that nails in environments with higher humidity levels will show more rapid rust formation due to the increased availability of moisture, which facilitates oxidation.",
