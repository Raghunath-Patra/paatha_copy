    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The setup involves a battery (12 V), variable resistance (rheostat), an ammeter, a plug key, and a long straight thick copper wire inserted through the center of a fixed rectangular cardboard sheet. Iron filings are sprinkled on the cardboard to visualize the magnetic field. When current flows through the wire, the filings align in concentric circles. Increasing the current (via the rheostat) makes the circles clearer and extends the magnetic field pattern, indicating a stronger field. Moving the compass further from the wire shows reduced deflection, demonstrating that the field strength decreases with distance.",
    "explanation": "This experiment illustrates that a straight current-carrying conductor produces a circular magnetic field. The variation in current alters the magnetic field strength, and the distance effect is evident by the changing deflection of the compass needle. This reinforces the concept of both direct proportionality with current and inverse relation with distance.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For a horizontal conductor carrying current from east to west, using the right-hand thumb rule, point your thumb towards the west (direction of current). At a point directly above the wire, the fingers will curl such that the magnetic field points towards the north. At a point directly below the wire, the curl of the fingers leads to a magnetic field pointing towards the south. This analysis is valid when considering the perspective from the ends of the conductor.",
    "explanation": "The right-hand thumb rule effectively links the orientation of current to the circular magnetic field surrounding the conductor. By aligning the thumb with the direction of current and examining the curl of the fingers, one can deduce the directions of the magnetic field at various points relative to the wire's position. This helps in analytical reasoning, especially when determining field directions in practical applications.",
