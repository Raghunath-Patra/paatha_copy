    "correct_answer": "Thermal decomposition involves breaking down a compound by heating (e.g., CaCO₃(s) → CaO(s) + CO₂(g) or lead nitrate decomposing upon heating). Electrolytic decomposition uses electrical energy to decompose a compound (e.g., the electrolysis of water: 2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g)). Photolytic decomposition, or photolysis, uses light energy to initiate the reaction (e.g., silver chloride decomposing under sunlight: 2AgCl(s) → 2Ag(s) + Cl₂(g)).",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the electrolysis of water, dilute sulphuric acid is added to enhance conductivity by providing ions. When an electric current is passed through the water, water molecules decompose into hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode. The volume of hydrogen collected is approximately double that of oxygen, consistent with the stoichiometric ratio in the equation: 2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g). Identification of the gases is confirmed experimentally—the gas at the cathode burns with a ‘pop’ sound (confirming hydrogen), while the gas at the anode supports combustion (confirming oxygen).",
    "explanation": "The dilute acid acts as an electrolyte, providing ions that facilitate the flow of current. The 2:1 volume ratio of hydrogen to oxygen directly reflects the balanced chemical equation for water decomposition. Observations such as the popping sound during the hydrogen test and oxygen's role in relighting a glowing splinter validate the identities of the gases.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reaction of calcium oxide with water is exothermic, meaning it releases energy in the form of heat, which is evident by the warmth of the beaker. This release of energy indicates that bond formation (in converting CaO and H₂O to Ca(OH)₂) is energetically favorable. In contrast, the reaction between barium hydroxide and ammonium chloride is endothermic—it absorbs heat, making the test tube cold. This indicates that energy is required to break the existing bonds and form new ones, resulting in a net absorption of energy from the surroundings.",
    "explanation": "Exothermic reactions release heat because the energy released during bond formation exceeds the energy required to break bonds, whereas endothermic reactions require energy input because bond breaking consumes more energy than is released during the formation of new bonds. These characteristics are vital for understanding reaction spontaneity and energy management in industrial and laboratory settings.",

    "correct_answer": "Decomposition reactions have significant industrial applications. For instance, the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) to produce quick lime (CaO) is crucial in the manufacture of cement and in various metallurgical processes. Similarly, the decomposition of lead nitrate is used to produce lead oxide, an important compound in the production of batteries and glass. However, these processes present environmental and safety concerns: the decomposition of calcium carbonate releases CO₂, a greenhouse gas, and the decomposition of lead nitrate produces toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and lead compounds, which pose health and environmental hazards if not properly managed.",
    "explanation": "While these reactions are essential for modern industries, the release of harmful byproducts necessitates strict controls and the development of cleaner technologies.
