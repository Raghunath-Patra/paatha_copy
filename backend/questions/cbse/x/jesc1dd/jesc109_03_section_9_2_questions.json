    "correct_answer": "Concave mirror – because a concave mirror converges parallel rays to its principal focus.",
    "explanation": "A concave mirror has an inwardly curved reflecting surface. When parallel rays (such as sunlight) hit it, the rays converge at the principal focus, forming a bright spot. This is unlike convex or plane mirrors.",

    "correct_answer": "R = 2f – for spherical mirrors with small apertures, the radius of curvature is twice the focal length.",
    "explanation": "This relationship, R = 2f, comes from the geometry of spherical mirrors under the paraxial approximation. It implies that the principal focus (F) lies midway between the pole (P) and the center of curvature (C).",

    "correct_answer": "When an object is placed beyond C, the image is real, inverted, and diminished, forming between F and C. At C, the image is real, inverted, and of the same size as the object. When the object is placed between C and F, the image becomes real, inverted, and enlarged, forming beyond C. Finally, if the object is placed between P and F, the mirror produces a virtual, erect, and enlarged image, which cannot be projected on a screen as it appears behind the mirror.",
    "explanation": "This variation occurs because the location of the object relative to P, F, and C determines the convergence or divergence of the reflected rays. Ray diagrams help visualize these changes: using the ray parallel to the principal axis (which reflects through F) and the ray through the center of curvature (which retraces its path) clearly shows the shifting intersection point of reflected rays as the object moves.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Constructing ray diagrams for spherical mirrors involves drawing at least two of the following rays: one ray parallel to the principal axis which, for concave mirrors, reflects through the principal focus (or appears to originate from the focus in convex mirrors); a second ray that passes through (or towards) the focus which reflects parallel to the principal axis; and a third ray through the center of curvature, which strikes the mirror perpendicularly and reflects back on itself. These rays intersect (or appear to intersect) at the location of the image, thus allowing one to determine its position, size, and orientation.",
    "explanation": "Choosing these specific rays simplifies the process of drawing accurate ray diagrams because their paths after reflection are predictable by the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection). This systematic approach is valuable in both theoretical analysis and practical experiments involving image formation.",
