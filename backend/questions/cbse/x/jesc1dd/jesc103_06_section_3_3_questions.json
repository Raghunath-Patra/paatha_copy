    "explanation": "The sodium atom, with an electronic configuration of 2,8,1, loses its single valence electron to achieve a stable configuration like neon (2,8). The chlorine atom, with an electronic configuration of 2,8,7, gains an electron to complete its octet (2,8,8).

    "correct_answer": "Heating an ionic compound like sodium chloride leads to melting rather than decomposition because the ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces. A large amount of energy is required to overcome these forces and cause a phase change, not just break the compound into its constituent atoms.",
    "explanation": "Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points due to the strong attractions between oppositely charged ions.

    "correct_answer": "Ionic compounds conduct electricity when molten or in aqueous solution because their ions are free to move, allowing the transfer of charge. In the solid state, the ions are fixed in a rigid lattice structure, preventing electrical conductivity.",
    "explanation": "The mobility of ions is essential for the conduction of electricity. In the solid form, ions are locked in place by strong electrostatic forces within the crystal lattice.

    "correct_answer": "Magnesium chloride is formed when a magnesium atom loses two electrons to form Mg²⁺ and two chlorine atoms each gain one electron to form Cl⁻. The balanced chemical equations are: Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻ and Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻. Combining these, the overall reaction is Mg + 2Cl → MgCl₂. The electronic configuration of Mg changes from 2,8,2 to 2,8 after losing two electrons and each Cl changes from 2,8,7 to 2,8,8 upon gaining one electron.",
    "explanation": "Magnesium (atomic number 12) has a configuration of 2,8,2. By losing two electrons, it obtains a stable configuration (2,8), analogous to neon. Each chlorine atom (atomic number 17) needs one electron to complete its octet, turning from 2,8,7 to 2,8,8. The electrostatic attraction between the resulting Mg²⁺ and two Cl⁻ ions forms the ionic compound MgCl₂.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ionic compounds consist of a lattice structure in which positively and negatively charged ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces. These forces require high amounts of energy to be overcome, which explains the high melting and boiling points. Their solubility in polar solvents like water is due to the ability of polar molecules to stabilize and surround the individual ions, effectively separating them. Furthermore, in molten form or in aqueous solution, the lattice breaks down and the ions are free to move, which allows them to conduct electricity.",
    "explanation": "The crystalline lattice of ionic compounds is characterized by a regular array of alternating charges. The energy needed to disrupt this arrangement—known as lattice energy—is high, leading to high melting and boiling points. In polar solvents, the partial charges of the solvent molecules interact with the ions, dissolving the lattice. In molten or dissolved states, the ions are no longer fixed and can move independently, thus carrying an electric current.",
