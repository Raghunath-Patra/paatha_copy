    "correct_answer": "Using kWh is more practical because the watt is a small unit, and typical household energy consumption is in the order of thousands of watt-hours. Billing in kWh simplifies numbers by converting them into a more manageable scale and aligns with commercial usage norms.",
    "explanation": "Watt-hour units would result in very large numbers for everyday energy consumption. For example, a refrigerator might consume tens of thousands of watt-hours over a month, making it cumbersome for billing and understanding energy usage.
