    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The scattering intensity of light by particles is highly dependent on the size of the particles relative to the wavelength of light. According to Rayleigh's scattering theory, particles that are much smaller than the wavelength of light scatter short wavelengths (blue light) more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red light). This is because the scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. As a result, when sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered in all directions by the small molecules and particles in the air, making the sky appear blue.",
    "explanation": "Rayleigh scattering explains that the amount of light scattered decreases dramatically as the wavelength increases. This is why even though sunlight contains all visible colors, blue light is scattered much more than red. The relationship can be mathematically described by a dependence on the inverse fourth power of the wavelength. This detailed understanding underpins the observation of a blue sky during daylight hours.",

In refractive errors like myopia and hypermetropia, the image of an object is formed either in front of or behind the retina due to the eye's shape or lens curvature. A concave lens in myopia diverges incoming light rays, moving the image formation onto the retina, while a convex lens in hypermetropia converges the diverging rays so they focus correctly. In daily life, these corrections allow individuals to see clearly, thereby enhancing quality of life, productivity, and school or work performance, and reducing accidents due to poor vision.",

    "correct_answer": "The process of dispersion involves several steps: First, a narrow beam of white light enters the glass prism. At the first interface, light refracts (bends) as it enters a denser medium. Each colour within the white light beam has a unique wavelength, and thus, a slightly different speed in the glass. As a result, the different colours bend at different angles. Violet, having the shortest wavelength, slows down the most and bends the greatest, whereas red, with the longest wavelength, bends the least. This difference in the angle of refraction causes the light to separate into a spectrum of colours. The separated colours then exit the prism as distinct rays, forming the complete spectrum.",
    "explanation": "Dispersion results from the variation in the refractive index for different wavelengths.

First, the prism is traced, and an incident ray (PE) is drawn inclined to one of its refracting surfaces. Pins are fixed along the incident ray and their images are observed through another face of the prism to establish collinearity. Points where the incident ray meets the prism (E and F) are identified. Perpendiculars to the surfaces are drawn at these points, marking the angles of incidence, refraction, and emergence. Finally, the deviation angle (∠D) between the incident and emergent rays is measured.",

    "correct_answer": "In a glass slab with parallel refracting surfaces, the incident light ray bends towards the normal on entering and away from the normal on exiting, resulting in a lateral displacement but the emergent ray remains parallel to the incident ray. In a triangular prism, however, because the refracting surfaces are inclined relative to each other, the light ray not only refracts at each surface (with the similar behavior of bending towards the normal upon entering and away upon exiting) but also emerges at an angle to the incident ray. This angular deviation depends on the angle of the prism and the refractive index of the glass.",

    "explanation": "The Earth's atmosphere is not uniform; it is made up of layers of air with changing densities. At higher altitudes, the air is cooler and denser, while at lower altitudes, near the surface, the air is warmer and less dense.

As sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, the lower portion of the Sun's light is refracted more strongly than the upper portion due to a steeper gradient in the refractive index at lower altitudes. This differential bending compresses the vertical extent of the Sun’s image, making it appear flattened.",
    "explanation": "At sunrise and sunset, the Sun's rays travel through a thicker layer of the atmosphere, where the temperature gradient is more pronounced. Since the lower rays of light are refracted more than the upper rays because they encounter a larger change in the refractive index, the vertical dimension of the Sun's disc is compressed.

Since stars are essentially point sources, any small deviation in the beam's path can lead to significant intensity fluctuations when seen through a telescope or with the naked eye.

    "correct_answer": "Accommodation is the process by which the eye adjusts its focal length by changing the curvature of the crystalline lens, enabling us to see objects clearly at different distances.",
    "explanation": "The ciliary muscles control the shape of the lens. When they contract, the lens thickens for near vision; when relaxed, the lens thins for distant vision. This dynamic adjustment is known as accommodation.",

    "correct_answer": "The near point, also known as the least distance of distinct vision, is the closest distance at which an object can be seen clearly, typically around 25 cm in a normal eye. The far point is the farthest distance at which objects can be seen clearly, which for a normal eye is at infinity.",
    "explanation": "These parameters define the range within which the eye can focus images sharply. The near point is limited by the minimum focal length the lens can achieve, and the far point is defined by the eye's ability to relax its focus for distant objects.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When light enters the eye, it first passes through the cornea where most initial refraction occurs. It then travels through the pupil, the size of which is regulated by the iris to control the light intensity. The light is further focused by the crystalline lens, which adjusts its curvature (through accommodation) to focus the image sharply on the retina. The retina, packed with photoreceptor cells, converts the focused light into electrical signals. These signals are sent via the optic nerve to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as coherent visual images.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The eye’s power of accommodation is achieved by the crystalline lens changing its curvature under the influence of the ciliary muscles. When viewing objects that are near, the ciliary muscles contract, causing the lens to become thicker and more curved, which decreases its focal length to focus the image on the retina. However, the lens cannot become infinitely curved. There is a minimum focal length below which clear vision is not possible, which is why objects held closer than about 25 cm appear blurred and can cause eye strain.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines how the physical adjustment of the lens helps in focusing on objects at various distances and emphasizes the limitation imposed by the minimum achievable focal length. It connects the physiological changes in the lens with the perceptual experience of clarity and strain.",

    "correct_answer": "Cataract is the clouding or opacification of the crystalline lens, often due to aging or other risk factors, which interferes with the passage of light to the retina. This results in blurred or diminished vision. Cataract surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and usually replacing it with an artificial intraocular lens, thereby restoring the clarity of the visual image.",
    "explanation": "This response explains that cataract is a degenerative condition affecting the lens, leading to impaired vision. The surgical treatment, which is a widely adopted clinical procedure, effectively restores vision by removing the source of the opacity and replacing it with a clear, artificial lens.",
