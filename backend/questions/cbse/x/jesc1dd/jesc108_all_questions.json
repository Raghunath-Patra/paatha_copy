    ],
    "correct_answer": "Trait B is likely to have arisen earlier because, in an asexual reproduction process, variations are mainly produced by rare copying errors. A trait present in a larger percentage (60%) indicates that it has been inherited over several generations, implying that it appeared earlier than a trait present in only 10% of the population.",
    "explanation": "In asexual reproduction, offspring are typically very similar to their parent due to identical genetic copying, with only minor variations resulting from errors in DNA replication. A trait that is found in 60% of individuals suggests that it has been passed down through many generations, increasing its frequency in the population, whereas a trait that appears in only 10% is likely a more recent variation. This reasoning is based on the principles of inheritance and the accumulation of variations over successive generations.",

Individuals with beneficial traits—such as heat tolerance, disease resistance, or improved resource utilization—are more likely to survive and reproduce. As a result, advantageous traits become more common over time, enhancing the overall resilience and continued survival of the species.",
    "explanation": "Variations are critical for a species' capacity to adapt in the face of environmental changes. When environments fluctuate—whether through climate shifts, disease outbreaks, or other factors—having a variety of traits within a population increases the likelihood that some individuals will possess characteristics that confer a survival advantage.

Since all progeny display violet flowers, the tall parent must contribute the dominant W allele while the short parent is homozygous recessive (ww) for the white trait. The observation that nearly half the progeny are short implies that the height trait shows a 1:1 segregation; hence the tall parent must be heterozygous (Tt) for height.

This process produces haploid gametes, each containing one allele for every gene.

    "correct_answer": "Minor copying errors in DNA replication, although infrequent, introduce mutations that can accumulate over generations in asexually reproducing organisms. Over time, even these subtle changes can lead to significant evolutionary outcomes. For example, in a population of bacteria, a mutation might confer resistance to an antibiotic. Environmental pressure—such as the presence of the antibiotic—then favors the survival of bacteria with this mutation.

These principles underscore the importance of both randomness (mutation) and the nonrandom process of selection in driving evolution.",

In Mendel’s experiments, tallness (T) is dominant over shortness (t), and round seed shape (R) is dominant over wrinkled seed shape (r).",

    "correct_answer": "A dihybrid cross between two heterozygous pea plants (e.g., RrYy) shows that the genes controlling two traits segregate independently, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. This independent assortment means that the inheritance of one trait does not affect the inheritance of another, leading to new trait combinations in the offspring.",
    "explanation": "The 9:3:3:1 ratio arises because the alleles for each trait are segregated into gametes randomly, and the formation of each gamete is independent of the other. This principle underlies much of modern genetics and is a key finding from Mendel’s experiments.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Mendel’s experiments with pea plants demonstrated that traits are inherited as discrete units. In monohybrid crosses, where one trait was observed (e.g., tall vs. short), crossing a homozygous dominant plant with a homozygous recessive plant resulted in all dominant-phenotype offspring in the F1 generation. However, self-pollinating these F1 plants produced an F2 generation with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio, indicating the segregation of alleles. In dihybrid crosses involving two traits (such as seed shape and color), the F1 generation exhibited the dominant traits, while the F2 generation exhibited a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. The appearance of these predictable ratios led Mendel to formulate his laws of segregation and independent assortment.",
    "explanation": "This answer highlights how counting and classifying offspring allowed Mendel to infer that alleles segregate during gamete formation (law of segregation) and that different traits are passed on independently of one another (law of independent assortment).",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Trait expression is governed by genes that encode proteins such as enzymes. In the case of plant height, a gene codes for an enzyme involved in synthesizing a growth hormone. If the gene produces an efficient enzyme, it results in abundant hormone production and a tall phenotype. Conversely, if a mutation produces a less efficient enzyme, less hormone is synthesized, leading to a short plant. This molecular mechanism explains how variations in a single gene can affect the overall phenotype.",

    "correct_answer": "First, identify two pure-breeding (homozygous) lines that contrast clearly in the trait of interest. Cross these two lines to produce an F1 generation. If all F1 offspring display the same phenotype, that phenotype is likely dominant. To confirm, allow the F1 plants to self-pollinate to produce an F2 generation. Analyze the phenotypic ratios in F2; a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive) suggests Mendelian inheritance of a single trait with dominant and recessive alleles. Additionally, performing test crosses between F1 individuals and homozygous recessive plants can help determine if the F1 individuals are heterozygous or homozygous dominant based on the ratio of offspring phenotypes.",
