    "correct_answer": "Aquariums have limited water volume and biodiversity, which leads to rapid accumulation of waste, excess nutrients, and toxins; thus, regular cleaning is needed to prevent harmful build-up. In contrast, natural ponds have larger volumes, more species, and complex nutrient cycles that aid in self-purification.",
    "explanation": "The confined space in an aquarium means that waste products (like ammonia from fish excreta) accumulate quickly, upsetting the balanced cycling of nutrients. Natural systems benefit from higher dilution and biodiversity, ensuring more efficient decomposition and recycling.",

    "correct_answer": "A food web is a complex network of interconnected food chains that shows multiple feeding relationships among organisms, while a food chain is a single linear sequence of organisms where each is eaten by the next.",
    "explanation": "In a food chain, energy flows in a single line from producers to various levels of consumers.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Energy flow in an ecosystem begins when producers, such as green plants, capture sunlight and convert it into chemical energy through photosynthesis. This energy is then transferred to primary consumers (herbivores) when they feed on the plants. Secondary consumers, which are carnivores that eat the herbivores, obtain energy next, followed by tertiary consumers. At each trophic level, energy is lost as heat during metabolism, for bodily maintenance, or due to incomplete digestion, which is why typically only about 10% of the energy passes to the next trophic level.",
    "explanation": "Photosynthesis initiates energy capture from sunlight. Each subsequent trophic interaction results in significant energy losses due to the second law of thermodynamics, as energy is dissipated predominantly in the form of heat. This progressive loss sets limitations on the number of trophic levels in an ecosystem.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Biological magnification refers to the process where the concentration of persistent, non-degradable chemicals (such as pesticides) increases as they move up the trophic levels. This occurs because organisms at lower levels absorb these chemicals from contaminated water, soil, or food and then, when consumed by predators, these chemicals accumulate at higher concentrations in their bodies. For example, small aquatic animals may accumulate pesticides that are further concentrated in large fish, which in turn can lead to high pesticide levels in human consumers, potentially causing health risks like cancer or neurological disorders.",
    "explanation": "Persistent chemicals are not efficiently metabolized or excreted, leading to their accumulation in body tissues. As they move up the food chain, each trophic level receives the total chemical load from many prey organisms, which increases the risk of toxic effects in top predators, including humans.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To design an aquarium experiment, one should include essential components such as water, oxygen (using an aerator), substrate (soil/sand), aquatic plants (producers), fish and small invertebrates (primary consumers), and decomposers like beneficial bacteria. The experiment should examine how producers generate oxygen through photosynthesis, which supports the respiration of fish, and how waste products become nutrients for plants via microbial decomposition. Regular maintenance (cleaning, feeding, and monitoring water quality) is crucial to prevent toxic buildup. Introducing a harmful species (like a predatory fish in a community with small fish) could disrupt the balance by consuming too many individuals, demonstrating the importance of species selection to maintain a balanced ecosystem.",
    "explanation": "This experiment highlights the principles of ecosystem maintenance, energy flow, and inter-species interactions, emphasizing that the balance in artificial ecosystems is delicate and requires careful design and management to closely mimic natural processes.",
