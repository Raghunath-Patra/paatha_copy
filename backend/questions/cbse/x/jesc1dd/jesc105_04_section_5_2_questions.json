    "correct_answer": "Guard cells regulate the opening and closing of stomata in plant leaves. When water is plentiful, guard cells swell (turgid) and open the pore for gas exchange. When water is scarce, they shrink (flaccid) causing the stomata to close to prevent water loss.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Photosynthesis involves three main steps: First, chlorophyll in the chloroplast absorbs light energy. Second, the absorbed light energy is converted into chemical energy, which causes the splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Third, the hydrogen is used to reduce carbon dioxide, forming carbohydrates (such as glucose). Not all these processes occur simultaneously; for instance, some plants can absorb carbon dioxide at night to prepare intermediates for later use during daylight.",
    "explanation": "Light absorption by chlorophyll facilitates the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy. The splitting of water (2H2O) results in oxygen production, and the reduction of CO2 leads to the formation of carbohydrates (as demonstrated by the equation: 6CO2 + 12H2O -(Chlorophyll/Sunlight)-> C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O). Each component—from water to carbon dioxide to chlorophyll—plays a crucial role in storing and transferring energy within the plant.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Digestion in the human alimentary canal begins in the mouth, where the food is mechanically broken down by chewing and chemically processed by salivary amylase that starts starch breakdown. The food then travels down the oesophagus to the stomach, where gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and pepsin further break down proteins. The mixture gradually releases into the small intestine, where bile from the liver and enzymes from the pancreas and intestinal glands complete the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The small intestine, with its villi, facilitates efficient absorption. Finally, undigested residues move into the large intestine where water is absorbed, and waste is formed for excretion through the anus.",
    "explanation": "Each organ in the alimentary canal is specialized for specific functions: mechanical breakdown (teeth and stomach churning), chemical digestion (enzymes), and absorption (small intestine). The coordinated action of these organs and enzymes ensures that food is converted into small molecules that nourish the body.",
