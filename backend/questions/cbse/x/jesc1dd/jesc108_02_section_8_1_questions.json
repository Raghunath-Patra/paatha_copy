    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In asexual reproduction, a single organism divides to produce offspring that are nearly identical to the parent. However, small inaccuracies during DNA replication, such as point mutations, introduce minor variations. Over many generations, these minor changes accumulate, leading to significant diversity within a population. This accumulated variation is crucial for evolution because it provides the raw materials on which natural selection can act, even though the rate of variation is slower compared to sexual reproduction.",
    "explanation": "The mechanism of asexual reproduction is efficient but limits genetic diversity to random mutations. These mutations, though rare, accumulate over time and can lead to observable phenotypic differences. When environmental pressures act on these variations, some individuals may have a survival advantage, ultimately leading to evolutionary change.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sexual reproduction generates diversity by combining genetic material from two different parents, creating offspring with unique allele combinations. This process introduces greater genetic variability than asexual reproduction, which relies solely on replication errors. Increased genetic diversity in a population improves its ability to adapt to environmental changes, as there is a higher likelihood that some individuals possess traits that confer survival advantages under new or changing conditions. These adaptive traits, when favored by natural selection, can lead to evolutionary shifts in the population.",
    "explanation": "The recombination of genes during sexual reproduction results in a broader range of genotypes. This diversity is critical for natural selection because it increases the pool of traits from which adaptive variations can arise, thereby enhancing the overall resilience and adaptability of the population in dynamic environments.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Minor copying errors in DNA replication, although infrequent, introduce mutations that can accumulate over generations in asexually reproducing organisms. Over time, even these subtle changes can lead to significant evolutionary outcomes. For example, in a population of bacteria, a mutation might confer resistance to an antibiotic. Environmental pressureâ€”such as the presence of the antibioticâ€”then favors the survival of bacteria with this mutation. This is an example of natural selection, where genetic variation (introduced by replication errors) combined with selective pressure results in evolutionary adaptation. These principles underscore the importance of both randomness (mutation) and the nonrandom process of selection in driving evolution.",
    "explanation": "Even in the absence of sexual recombination, the accumulation of small mutations can alter phenotypes over extended periods. Natural selection then acts on these variations, favoring beneficial traits. Examples include antibiotic resistance in bacteria and changes in enzyme efficiency in metabolic pathways, illustrating how micro-level errors can have macro-level evolutionary impacts.",
