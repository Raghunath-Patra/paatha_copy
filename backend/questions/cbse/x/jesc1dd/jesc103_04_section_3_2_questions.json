    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sodium is stored in kerosene oil because it reacts very vigorously with both water and oxygen when exposed to air. If left exposed, it can react violently with moisture in the air or oxygen to produce sodium oxide or sodium hydroxide, and the exothermic nature of this reaction can lead to fires or explosions.",
    "explanation": "Storing sodium in kerosene serves as a barrier preventing contact with air and moisture, thereby averting any hazardous reactions. This storage method minimizes the risk of accidental ignition and fire.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Displacement reactions involve a more reactive metal displacing a less reactive metal from its salt solution. In Activity 3.12, when an iron nail is placed in a copper sulphate solution, iron displaces copper from the solution, forming iron sulphate and depositing copper metal on the nail. The balanced equation is: Fe(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → FeSO₄(aq) + Cu(s). This reaction demonstrates that iron is more reactive than copper, which is one of the pieces of evidence used to construct the reactivity series.",
    "explanation": "Displacement reactions directly show the relative reactivity of metals. A metal that can displace another from its compound in solution is more reactive. This method is simple, observable, and forms the empirical basis for establishing the reactivity series.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experimental procedure involved taking samples of metals and burning them over a flame with proper safety precautions (using tongs and eye protection as necessary). The flame colors observed—such as yellow for sodium, dazzling white for magnesium, bluish-green for zinc, and red for copper—are significant because they provide qualitative evidence of the metal’s reactivity and the type of metal oxide formed. These observations, along with the differing ease of burning and changes in the metal’s surface, help in arranging the metals in order of their reactivity towards oxygen.",
    "explanation": "Flame color is indicative of the specific energy transitions of the metal ions as they form their respective oxides. This method of characterization is both educational and practical in determining the underlying chemical properties and reactivity order of metals.",

    "correct_answer": "False. Only highly reactive metals, like sodium or potassium, produce enough heat when reacting with water to ignite the hydrogen gas immediately, whereas less reactive metals do not.",
    "explanation": "The reaction of metals with water is exothermic, but the heat evolved varies with metal reactivity.

    "correct_answer": "The formation of a protective oxide layer on a metal serves as a barrier that prevents further oxidation of the metal. For example, aluminium forms a thin layer of aluminium oxide (Al₂O₃) when exposed to air, which protects it from further reaction with oxygen, thereby slowing down its apparent reactivity.",
