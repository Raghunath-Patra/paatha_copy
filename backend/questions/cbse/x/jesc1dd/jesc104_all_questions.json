While the C–H bonds are essentially non-polar due to similar electronegativities, the C–Cl bond is polar because chlorine is more electronegative. Overall, each shared electron pair constitutes a covalent bond that enables both atoms to achieve their stable, noble gas-like configuration.",
    "explanation": "Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons so that each atom can complete its valence shell. In CH₃Cl, carbon’s tetravalency allows it to form four bonds simultaneously.

Chemically, ethanoic acid, being an acid, reacts with bases (e.g., Na₂CO₃ or NaHCO₃) to produce effervescence (CO₂ gas evolution), while ethanol does not. Additionally, ethanol decolorizes oxidizing agents like alkaline KMnO₄ due to its ability to be oxidized, whereas ethanoic acid, the oxidation product, shows little or no such change.",

    "correct_answer": "Micelle formation occurs because soap molecules are amphiphilic, meaning they have a hydrophobic long-chain tail and a hydrophilic ionic head. In water, the hydrophobic parts aggregate to minimize contact with water, while the hydrophilic heads remain in contact with the aqueous phase, forming spherical structures known as micelles. In a solvent like ethanol, which is less polar than water, the driving force for micelle formation is greatly reduced or absent because both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts may be soluble, meaning that soap molecules tend to remain individually dissolved.",
    "explanation": "In water, the polarity of the solvent forces the non-polar hydrocarbon chains of soap molecules to cluster together (hydrophobic effect).

    "correct_answer": "Soaps are amphiphilic molecules with a hydrophobic (non-polar) tail and a hydrophilic (polar) head. When added to water during cleaning, the hydrophobic tails attach to oil or grease particles while the hydrophilic heads remain in contact with water. This leads to the formation of spherical structures called micelles, where the oil is encapsulated within the center. The micelles remain suspended in water and can be washed away, thus removing the dirt.",
    "explanation": "The cleaning process involves emulsification – the hydrophobic parts of soap molecules surround and solubilize oily dirt, while the hydrophilic parts interact with water. This dual interaction enables the dispersion of dirt and grease, making them easier to rinse off. Diagrams of micelles often show the hydrophobic tails pointing inward and the hydrophilic heads outward, reinforcing the concept of emulsification.",

The ionization energy required to remove four electrons (to form C4⁺) is extremely high, and the electron affinity for carbon is not sufficient to stabilize the addition of four extra electrons (to form C4⁻). Instead, by sharing electrons with other atoms, carbon achieves a stable octet in a more energy-efficient manner.",
    "explanation": "The high ionization energy means that removing electrons to form a cation is very energy-intensive, and the low electron affinity means that adding electrons to form an anion does not release enough energy to compensate for the repulsion and instability caused by overcrowding the outer shell.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A mixture of ethyne and air is not used because air contains only about 21% oxygen; the rest is mainly nitrogen which does not support combustion and absorbs heat. This results in a lower flame temperature that is insufficient for welding. For welding applications, a much higher temperature is required, and thus ethyne must be burned in pure oxygen (oxy-acetylene flame) to achieve complete combustion and the necessary high flame temperature.",
    "explanation": "Welding requires extremely high temperatures to melt metals and form strong joints. When ethyne (C₂H₂) burns in pure oxygen, the flame—known as the oxy-acetylene flame—achieves the high temperatures needed for welding due to complete combustion. In contrast, air is composed of only about 21% oxygen, with the remaining 79% being largely inert nitrogen. The nitrogen absorbs heat and lowers the overall flame temperature. As a result, burning ethyne in air produces a cooler flame, which is not effective for welding.

When the air hole at the base of the bunsen burner is fully open, there is a sufficient supply of oxygen which supports complete combustion. Complete combustion results in a blue, non-luminous flame because the fuel burns completely into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O), with minimal soot production. Conversely, when the air hole is partially closed, the limited oxygen supply leads to incomplete combustion. Incomplete combustion produces unburnt carbon particles that glow, causing a yellow, sooty, and luminous flame. The deposition of soot is a clear indication of the presence of unoxidized carbon.",
    "explanation": "Controlled oxygen supply directly impacts the efficiency and temperature of the combustion reaction. A flame with excess oxygen ensures all carbon in the fuel is oxidized, resulting in a blue flame. Reduced oxygen supply leads to partial oxidation, where carbon particles do not burn entirely, emitting yellow light as they glow due to incandescence. This experiment illustrates the importance of proper air-fuel mixtures in combustion devices, such as gas stoves to prevent fuel wastage and soot formation.",

    "correct_answer": "Incomplete combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of harmful by-products into the environment. When fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum do not combust completely, significant amounts of soot (black carbon) are produced, which can contribute to air pollution and respiratory problems. Additionally, impurities in fossil fuels, including nitrogen and sulphur, form nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and sulphur oxides (SOₓ) during combustion. These oxides are major pollutants that lead to smog formation, acid rain, and contribute to global atmospheric changes. The emission of these pollutants from power plants, vehicles, and other combustion engines has significant adverse effects on both public health and the environment.",
    "explanation": "Incomplete combustion results in lower combustion temperatures and inefficient burning of fuel, resulting in the formation of particulate matter and various gaseous pollutants. The presence of elements like sulphur and nitrogen in fossil fuels further exacerbates the environmental impact by creating acid rain and contributing to respiratory disorders in humans.

When a drop of alcohol (e.g., ethanol) is applied to blue litmus paper, there is no color change as alcohols are neutral. In contrast, a carboxylic acid (e.g., ethanoic acid) will turn blue litmus red due to its acidic nature. Likewise, when treated with sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate, a carboxylic acid produces brisk effervescence (CO₂ gas evolution) while an alcohol shows no reaction.",
    "explanation": "Carboxylic acids are acidic because they can donate a proton (H⁺) from the –COOH group, which is sufficient to change the pH indicator (litmus) and react with bases like Na₂CO₃ to release CO₂. Alcohols, on the other hand, have a hydroxyl group (–OH) that is only weakly acidic and does not ionize significantly in water, thus showing no effect on litmus paper and no reaction with sodium carbonate under normal conditions.

Butanone contains a ketone group (C=O) on a four-carbon chain, while hexanal is an aldehyde with the formyl (–CHO) group at one end of a six-carbon chain. Drawing correct structural representations (using Lewis dot structures or skeletal formulas) is crucial to illustrate bonding and positions of functional groups.",

    "correct_answer": "(i) CH₃—CH₂—Br is named bromoethane. (ii) H—C=O is named methanal. (iii) A four-carbon chain with a terminal triple bond is named but-1-yne.",
    "explanation": "Bromoethane is derived by substituting a hydrogen atom in ethane with a bromine atom, following the halogenoalkane nomenclature. Methanal is the simplest aldehyde, commonly known as formaldehyde, and its name is formed by replacing the -e of methane with -anal. For a four-carbon chain with a triple bond, the suffix changes from -ane to -yne, and the position of the triple bond determines the numbering; with the triple bond on the first carbon, the compound is correctly named but-1-yne. (Note: The text provided an example of hex-1-yne for a six-carbon chain; here, we adjust for a four-carbon chain as per the question.)",
