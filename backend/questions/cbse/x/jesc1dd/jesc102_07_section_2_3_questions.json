    "correct_answer": "14",
    "explanation": "On the pH scale (0-14), a pH value closer to 14 indicates a strongly basic (alkaline) solution because it corresponds to a very low concentration of H⁺ ions and a high concentration of OH⁻ ions.",

    "correct_answer": "pH is a numerical scale that measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) present in a solution. The scale typically ranges from 0 to 14, where lower pH values indicate acidic conditions, a pH of 7 indicates neutrality, and higher pH values indicate basic (alkaline) conditions. This measurement is significant because it helps determine the strength of acids and bases in both laboratory and everyday settings.",

    "correct_answer": "A universal indicator is a mixture of several pH-sensitive dyes. It changes colour depending on the pH of the solution it is added to. By comparing the observed colour with a standard colour chart, one can estimate the pH of the solution, thereby indicating whether it is acidic, neutral, or basic.",
    "explanation": "The universal indicator provides a simple and quick method to visually assess the pH of a solution. The colour changes result from the indicator dyes undergoing molecular structure changes in response to different hydrogen ion concentrations.",

    "correct_answer": "Strong acids ionise completely in water, releasing a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺), while weak acids only partially ionise, resulting in a lower concentration of H⁺ ions. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, whereas acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Activity 2.11, students test various solutions by dipping universal indicator paper into each sample. The paper changes colour based on the hydrogen ion (H⁺) or hydroxide ion (OH⁻) concentration of the solution. These colours are then compared to a reference chart to assign approximate pH values. For example, a lower pH (e.g., ~2.2 for lemon juice) signifies high H⁺ concentration, indicating a strong acid, while a higher pH (e.g., ~14 for 1M NaOH) indicates a strong base. This process demonstrates that the magnitude of ionisation directly relates to the acid or base strength.",
    "explanation": "The procedure reinforces the concept that pH is a quantitative measure of H⁺ concentration. A solution's pH value reflects its corrosiveness or neutralising capacity, making it a critical parameter in both scientific experiments and real-world applications such as environmental monitoring and gastroenterology.",

    "correct_answer": "pH is critical in everyday life as it affects both environmental and human biological systems. In aquatic ecosystems, a sudden drop in pH, such as from acid rain (pH < 5.6), can reduce water quality and threaten aquatic life by disrupting physiological processes. In human health, the body requires a near-neutral pH (~7.0) for optimal function. The digestive system uses hydrochloric acid for digestion, but excess acid can lead to conditions like indigestion, addressed with antacids like milk of magnesia. Moreover, dental enamel is vulnerable to decay when mouth pH drops below 5.5, so maintaining a near-neutral mouth environment is essential for preventing tooth decay. Thus, monitoring and regulating pH is vital for environmental protection and maintaining human health.",

Analyze the collected data to correlate the observed soil pH with the health and growth of the plants. By plotting soil pH against plant performance indicators (like leaf colour, growth rate, fruit yield), determine the range of pH that optimally supports healthy plant growth.",
