    "correct_answer": "The experiment involves placing a triangular glass prism on a white paper fixed on a drawing board. First, the prism is traced, and an incident ray (PE) is drawn inclined to one of its refracting surfaces. Pins are fixed along the incident ray and their images are observed through another face of the prism to establish collinearity. Points where the incident ray meets the prism (E and F) are identified. Perpendiculars to the surfaces are drawn at these points, marking the angles of incidence, refraction, and emergence. Finally, the deviation angle (∠D) between the incident and emergent rays is measured.",

    "correct_answer": "In a glass slab with parallel refracting surfaces, the incident light ray bends towards the normal on entering and away from the normal on exiting, resulting in a lateral displacement but the emergent ray remains parallel to the incident ray. In a triangular prism, however, because the refracting surfaces are inclined relative to each other, the light ray not only refracts at each surface (with the similar behavior of bending towards the normal upon entering and away upon exiting) but also emerges at an angle to the incident ray. This angular deviation depends on the angle of the prism and the refractive index of the glass.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Drawing normals at the points of incidence (E) and emergence (F) is crucial as they serve as reference lines for accurately measuring the angles of incidence, refraction, and emergence. The normals help in applying Snell's law, which describes the relationship between these angles as light passes from one medium to another. This ensures that the observed bending of light is precisely quantified and the angle of deviation is correctly determined.",
