    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To determine the structure of ethene (C₂H₄), first, connect the two carbon atoms with a single bond. Each carbon then has one unsatisfied valency, necessitating additional bonds. A double bond between the carbons satisfies the remaining valency, with each carbon additionally bonding to two hydrogen atoms. For ethyne (C₂H₂), after linking the two carbons, they each still have unsatisfied valencies. Because the only way to satisfy these is with a triple bond between the carbons, each carbon bonds to a single hydrogen atom. Thus, ethyne is represented as H–C≡C–H.",
    "explanation": "The process involves linking carbon atoms first, then satisfying the remaining valencies by adding hydrogen atoms. For unsaturated compounds like ethene and ethyne, multiple bonds (double and triple bonds respectively) are used to satisfy the valencies because single bonds alone would leave the electrons unpaired.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Butane (C₄H₁₀) can exist as two structural isomers: n-butane and isobutane. n-Butane has a straight chain of four carbon atoms (C–C–C–C), while isobutane features a branched structure where three carbon atoms form a chain and the fourth is attached as a side branch. Despite having the same molecular formula, the two isomers have different physical properties and reactivities because of the different arrangements of the carbon atoms.",
    "explanation": "Structural isomerism arises when compounds share the same molecular formula but differ in atom connectivity. In butane, the linear arrangement results in a different spatial configuration and intermolecular interactions compared to the branched form, which affects characteristics such as boiling point and reactivity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The nomenclature of organic compounds involves first identifying the longest carbon chain and then determining the functional group present. For alcohols, the suffix '-ol' is appended to the base name (for example, a three-carbon chain becomes propanol). If the functional group suffix starts with a vowel, the final 'e' in the alkane name is dropped (propanol, not propanol with an extra 'e'). For ketones, the suffix '-one' is used, where the position of the carbonyl group is indicated if necessary (e.g., propanone). The process ensures that the name reflects both the carbon backbone and the type and position of the functional groups.",
    "explanation": "Organizing the name requires identifying the carbon chain length and then modifying it with the appropriate suffix (or prefix in some cases) based on the functional group. This systematic approach allows chemists to clearly and accurately communicate molecular structures, ensuring consistency and clarity in chemical literature.",

    "correct_answer": "False. Saturated compounds are generally less reactive than unsaturated compounds because the double or triple bonds in unsaturated compounds introduce points of higher electron density, making them more reactive.",
