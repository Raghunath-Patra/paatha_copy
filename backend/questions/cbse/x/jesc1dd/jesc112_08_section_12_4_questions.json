    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A domestic electric circuit begins with the main supply (mains) delivering 220 V through live (red) and neutral (black) wires. These wires enter the home through the meter-board, where they pass via the main fuse and an electricity meter. The power is then distributed to separate circuits (often one for heavy appliances like geysers and one for lighter appliances like bulbs and fans) through a distribution box containing a main switch and individual fuses. Safety is enhanced with the incorporation of an earth wire (green) connected to metal plates in the ground, which ensures any leakage current is safely directed away from users.",
    "explanation": "This detailed explanation describes the entire path of electrical energy from its entry point into the home, through protective devices such as fuses and switches, to the individual appliances that receive power. It emphasizes both the operational design—such as parallel appliance connection ensuring uniform voltage—and the safety measures, particularly the use of the earth wire, to prevent electric shock.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Connecting the metallic bodies of appliances to the earth wire ensures that any leakage current, from insulation failures or internal faults, passes safely to the ground, thereby keeping the appliance body at earth potential. Without this measure, the leakage could raise the appliance's potential to a dangerous level, increasing the risk of severe electric shock to users.",
    "explanation": "The explanation highlights that the earth wire provides a controlled path for leakage currents, effectively neutralizing any unintended build-up of voltage on metallic surfaces. This safety mechanism is critical in preventing accidental electrocution and ensuring that appliances operate safely in the domestic environment.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Connecting multiple high-power appliances on a single 15 A circuit can lead to overloading, causing the fuse to blow or even risking a short-circuit. This condition leads to excessive heating and potential damage to appliances and wiring. To prevent this, it is necessary to distribute high-load appliances across different circuits, adhere to current ratings, and ensure that each socket is used within its capacity.",
    "explanation": "The answer identifies the risks of overloading—such as fuse blowouts and overheating—and suggests practical safety measures like proper load distribution and adherence to current ratings. These measures eliminate risks by ensuring that no circuit carries more current than it is designed to handle, thereby preventing damage and maintaining household safety.",
