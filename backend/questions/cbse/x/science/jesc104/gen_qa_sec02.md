    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Carbon's unique ability to form strong covalent bonds with itself (catenation) and its tetravalency, which allows bonding with four other atoms, enable the formation of a vast number of stable compounds.",
    "explanation": "Carbon can form stable single, double, and triple bonds with other carbon atoms due to its strong covalent bonds and small atomic size. Its tetravalency allows it to bond with four other atoms, whether they are carbon or other elements, leading to diverse molecular structures and a large number of possible compounds.",

    "correct_answer": "Ethane (C₂H�6)",
    "explanation": "Ethane (C₂H₆) demonstrates catenation by having a carbon-carbon single bond, allowing for extended carbon chains. Methane has only one carbon atom and does not exhibit catenation. Silicon hydrides can form chains but are less stable and less extensive than carbon chains. Carbon dioxide does not have carbon-carbon bonds.",

    "explanation": "Alkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one triple bond between carbon atoms. The presence of a triple bond reduces the number of hydrogen atoms by four compared to alkanes (which have only single bonds). Therefore, the general formula is CₙH₂ₙ₋₂.
