    "correct_answer": "There are three structural isomers for pentane: n-pentane, isopentane (methylbutane), and neopentane (dimethylpropane).",
    "explanation": "Pentane (C\u2085H\u2081\u2082) can arrange its carbon atoms in three different ways, leading to three structural isomers:\n\n1. **n-pentane (Normal pentane):** A straight-chain structure where all five carbon atoms are connected linearly (CH\u2083—CH\u2082—CH\u2082—CH\u2082—CH\u2083).\n\n2. **Isopentane (Methylbutane):** A branched-chain structure with a methyl group attached to the second carbon (CH\u2083—CH(CH\u2083)—CH\u2082—CH\u2083).\n\n3. **Neopentane (Dimethylpropane):** A highly branched structure where two methyl groups are attached to the second carbon of propane (C(CH\u2083)\u2084).\n\nThese different arrangements result in distinct chemical and physical properties despite having the same molecular formula.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The two properties are the tetravalency of carbon, allowing it to form four covalent bonds, and catenation, the ability of carbon to form long chains and complex structures by bonding with other carbon atoms.",
    "explanation": "Carbon's tetravalency means it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. This allows for the creation of complex and varied structures. Additionally, catenation refers to carbon's unique ability to bond with itself repeatedly, enabling the formation of long chains, branched structures, and rings. These two properties combined make carbon incredibly versatile, leading to the vast diversity of organic compounds observed.",

    "correct_answer": "The molecular formula of cyclopentane is C\u2085H\u2081\u2080. Its electron dot structure consists of a ring of five carbon atoms, each bonded to two hydrogen atoms, with single bonds between adjacent carbon atoms.",
    "explanation": "Cyclopentane (C\u2085H\u2081\u2080) is a cyclic hydrocarbon with a ring of five carbon atoms. Each carbon atom in the ring forms two single bonds with neighboring carbon atoms and two single bonds with hydrogen atoms to satisfy its tetravalency. The electron dot structure can be visualized as a pentagon with each vertex representing a carbon atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms and connected to the adjacent carbons by single bonds.",

Bromopentane can exist in three isomeric forms depending on the position of the bromine atom on the carbon chain: 1-bromopentane, 2-bromopentane, and 3-bromopentane. These isomers have the same molecular formula (C\u2085H\u2081\u2080Br) but different structural arrangements, leading to different physical and chemical properties.",
    "explanation": "1. **Ethanoic acid:** It contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to a two-carbon chain.\n\n2. **Bromopentane:** There are three structural isomers based on the position of the bromine atom: 1-Bromopentane, 2-Bromopentane, and 3-Bromopentane.\n\n3. **Butanone:** It contains a ketone group (C=O) on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain.\n\n4. **Hexanal:** It contains an aldehyde group (-CHO) at the end of a six-carbon chain.\n\n**Structural isomers for bromopentane** arise because the bromine atom can be attached to different carbon atoms within the pentane chain, creating distinct compounds with unique properties despite having the same molecular formula.",

    "explanation": "To name CH\u2083—CH\u2082—Br, follow the nomenclature rules for haloalkanes:\n\n1. Identify the longest carbon chain, which has two carbon atoms, so the base name is 'ethane'.\n\n2. Identify the substituent, which is a bromine atom attached to the first carbon atom (implicitly, since both carbons are equivalent in a two-carbon chain).\n\n3. Combine the substituent name with the base name: 'bromoethane' or use the common name 'ethyl bromide'.",
