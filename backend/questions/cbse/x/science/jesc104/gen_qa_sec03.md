    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The balanced equation is:\n\[ \mathrm{C_2H_5OH + 3\,O_2 \rightarrow 2\,CO_2 + 3\,H_2O} \]",
    "explanation": "To balance the combustion reaction:\n1. **Carbon (C):** There are 2 carbon atoms in ethanol (\( \mathrm{C_2H_5OH} \)), so we need 2 \( \mathrm{CO_2} \) molecules to balance the carbon atoms.\n2. **Hydrogen (H):** Ethanol has 6 hydrogen atoms. To balance hydrogen, we need 3 \( \mathrm{H_2O} \) molecules (since each \( \mathrm{H_2O} \) has 2 hydrogen atoms).\n3. **Oxygen (O):** On the left side, ethanol has 1 oxygen atom and 3 \( \mathrm{O_2} \) molecules contribute 6 oxygen atoms, totaling 7 oxygen atoms. On the right side, 2 \( \mathrm{CO_2} \) molecules provide 4 oxygen atoms and 3 \( \mathrm{H_2O} \) molecules provide 3 oxygen atoms, totaling 7 oxygen atoms. Thus, the equation is balanced.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Complete combustion of hydrocarbons occurs when there is sufficient oxygen, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide (\( \mathrm{CO_2} \)) and water (\( \mathrm{H_2O} \)) with a clean blue flame and minimal smoke. In contrast, incomplete combustion happens when oxygen supply is limited, leading to the formation of carbon monoxide (\( \mathrm{CO} \)) or carbon (soot) along with water. This results in a yellow, sooty flame and the production of black smoke.\n\n- **Complete Combustion:** Blue flame, efficient energy release, no soot.\n- **Incomplete Combustion:** Yellow flame, presence of soot, and smoke.",
    "explanation": "Complete combustion requires ample oxygen, ensuring that all carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon are fully oxidized to \( \mathrm{CO_2} \), producing a blue flame indicative of higher energy release and minimal soot. Incomplete combustion lacks sufficient oxygen, leading to partial oxidation where some carbon forms \( \mathrm{CO} \) or solid soot, resulting in a yellow flame and visible smoke.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When alkaline potassium permanganate is added to ethanol, it acts as an oxidizing agent and oxidizes ethanol to acetic acid, reducing the permanganate ion (\( \mathrm{MnO_4^-} \)) to \( \mathrm{MnO_2} \), which is a brown precipitate. Initially, the added permanganate ion is consumed in the oxidation reaction, causing the purple color to fade. However, when excess potassium permanganate is added, not all of it can react with ethanol because ethanol is limited. The remaining excess permanganate ion retains its purple color, causing the color to persist.",
    "explanation": "Alkaline potassium permanganate (\( \mathrm{KMnO_4} \)) is a strong oxidizing agent that oxidizes ethanol. In stoichiometric amounts, all the permanganate ions react, leading to decolorization. Upon adding excess \( \mathrm{KMnO_4} \), there's more oxidizing agent than ethanol, so the surplus \( \mathrm{KMnO_4} \) remains unreacted, maintaining its characteristic purple color in the solution.",

    "correct_answer": "Catalysts like palladium or nickel facilitate the addition of hydrogen to unsaturated hydrocarbons by lowering the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of the hydrogenation reaction without being consumed in the process.",
    "explanation": "Catalysts provide an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy, allowing hydrogen molecules to dissociate and add more efficiently to the double or triple bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbons, resulting in their saturation.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The combustion of fuels containing sulfur and nitrogen leads to the formation of sulfur oxides (\( \mathrm{SO_x} \)) and nitrogen oxides (\( \mathrm{NO_x} \)). These oxides are major environmental pollutants because they contribute to the formation of acid rain, which can damage ecosystems, aquatic life, vegetation, and infrastructure. Additionally, nitrogen oxides are involved in the formation of ground-level ozone and smog, which have harmful effects on human health and the environment.",
    "explanation": "Sulfur oxides, primarily \( \mathrm{SO_2} \) and \( \mathrm{SO_3} \), react with water vapor in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, leading to acid rain. Nitrogen oxides, such as \( \mathrm{NO} \) and \( \mathrm{NO_2} \), not only contribute to acid rain but also participate in photochemical reactions that produce ground-level ozone and particulate matter, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hydrogenation of vegetable oils converts unsaturated fatty acids, which contain one or more double bonds, into saturated fatty acids by adding hydrogen atoms. This process increases the saturation level, resulting in oils that are more solid at room temperature. Saturated fats are more stable and have a longer shelf life but are associated with negative health effects, such as increased levels of LDL cholesterol. Additionally, hydrogenation eliminates or reduces the presence of double bonds, making the oils less prone to oxidation and rancidity.",
    "explanation": "Unsaturated fatty acids have double bonds that introduce kinks in the hydrocarbon chains, preventing tight packing and keeping the oils liquid at room temperature. Hydrogenation adds hydrogen atoms across these double bonds, converting them into single bonds, thereby straightening the chains. This increased saturation allows the molecules to pack closely together, turning liquid oils into semi-solid or solid fats. While this enhances shelf stability and alters texture for culinary purposes, it also increases the content of saturated fats, which are linked to health risks.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Coal and charcoal emit heat without producing a visible flame because their combustion primarily involves solid carbon particles reacting with oxygen, leading to a glowing or smoldering effect. This type of combustion occurs on the surface of the solid fuel, releasing heat through the oxidation of carbon without producing sufficient volatile gases to sustain a visible flame. In contrast, substances like methane undergo combustion in the gaseous phase, where the fuel vaporizes and mixes with oxygen to form a flame. The gaseous reactants burn with a visible luminous flame due to the rapid reaction of methane and oxygen producing light and heat.",
    "explanation": "Coal and charcoal consist of solid carbon that burns slowly on the surface, emitting heat through continuous oxidation. The absence of volatile gases means there is no rapid reaction to produce a flame. Methane, being a gas, can easily mix with oxygen and ignite quickly, resulting in a bright, visible flame due to the exothermic reaction in the gaseous phase where energy is released both as heat and light.",
