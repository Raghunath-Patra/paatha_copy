      "A) They both show the same pH value.",

      "D) Both do not show any color change."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B) Hydrochloric acid shows a lower pH than ethanoic acid.",
    "explanation": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid and completely ionizes in water, resulting in a higher concentration of H⁺ ions and thus a lower pH compared to ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH), which is a weak acid and only partially ionizes. Therefore, using a universal indicator, dilute HCl will exhibit a more acidic color (indicating a lower pH) than the same concentration of dilute ethanoic acid.\n\nOption A is incorrect because strong and weak acids do not have the same pH at the same concentration. Option C is incorrect as it reverses the actual relationship. Option D is incorrect because both acids will cause a color change with a universal indicator.",

    "correct_answer": "Saponification is the hydrolysis of an ester under basic conditions to form an alcohol and a salt of a carboxylic acid. In the context of ethanoic acid, saponification involves reacting an ethanoic acid ester with sodium hydroxide (a base) to produce ethanol and sodium ethanoate (the sodium salt of ethanoic acid).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nCH₃COOC₂H₅ + NaOH → C₂H₅OH + CH₃COONa",
    "explanation": "Saponification is a fundamental reaction in soap making. Here, ethanoic acid reacts with an alcohol (ethanol in this case) to form an ester (ethyl acetate). When this ester reacts with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), it undergoes hydrolysis to produce ethanol and sodium ethanoate.\n\nThe step-by-step reaction is as follows:\n1. Formation of the ester:\n   CH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH → CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂O\n2. Saponification of the ester with NaOH:\n   CH₃COOC₂H₅ + NaOH → C₂H₅OH + CH₃COONa\n\nOverall prominent reaction:\nCH₃COOC₂H₅ + NaOH → C₂H₅OH + CH₃COONa\n\nThis reaction demonstrates the conversion of esters back to their constituent alcohol and carboxylate salt, which is essential in soap formation.",

    "explanation": "Consumption of large quantities of ethanol leads to the depression of the central nervous system. This results in symptoms such as lack of coordination, mental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of inhibitions, and stupor. \n\nOption A is incorrect because ethanol depresses rather than enhances coordination and alertness. Option B is incorrect as ethanol slows down metabolic processes. Option D is incorrect because ethanol has significant effects on the nervous system.",
