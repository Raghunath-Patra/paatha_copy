    "correct_answer": "Electrons flow in a conductor due to the presence of a potential difference, similar to how water flows from a region of higher pressure to lower pressure. If one end of a conductor is connected to a source of higher electric potential (akin to a water tank at a higher level), electrons are pushed to move towards the lower potential end, creating an electric current.",
    "explanation": "In the water analogy, water remains stationary in a perfectly horizontal tube without a pressure difference. Similarly, electrons in a conductor do not flow without a potential difference. When a potential difference is applied, it creates an 'electric pressure' that drives electrons from the higher potential to the lower potential, resulting in current flow.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A battery in an electric circuit provides a constant electric potential difference by converting its stored chemical energy into electrical energy. This potential difference creates an electric field within the circuit, which drives electrons to move through the conductor, thereby maintaining a continuous electric current. As the current flows, the battery's chemical energy is expended to sustain the potential difference against the energy losses in the circuit.",
    "explanation": "The battery serves as a source of electric potential difference by utilizing chemical reactions within the cell to separate charges and create a voltage across its terminals. This voltage establishes an electric field in the connected circuit, pushing electrons from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, thus maintaining current flow. The energy required to maintain this potential difference comes from the chemical energy stored in the battery, which is gradually consumed as the current does work in the circuit.",
