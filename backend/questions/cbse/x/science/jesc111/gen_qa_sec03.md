    "explanation": "In pure metals, the lattice structure is orderly, allowing electrons to flow easily, resulting in lower resistivity. When different metals are combined to form an alloy, the irregularities and varied atomic sizes disrupt the electron flow, causing increased scattering of electrons. This increased scattering leads to higher resistivity in alloys compared to their pure metal constituents.",

Using \( R = \rho \frac{l}{A} \), the new resistance \( R' = \rho \frac{2l}{\frac{A}{2}} = 4R \).
