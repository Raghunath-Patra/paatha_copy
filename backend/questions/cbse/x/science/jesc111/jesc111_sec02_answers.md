    "correct_answer": "It means that \(1 \, \text{joule}\) of work is done to move a charge of \(1 \, \text{coulomb}\) from one point to the other.",
    "explanation": "The electric potential difference \(V\) between two points is defined as the work \(W\) done per unit charge \(Q\) to move the charge between those points. Mathematically, \( V = \frac{W}{Q} \). Therefore, a potential difference of \(1 \, \text{V}\) indicates that \(1 \, \text{J}\) of work is required to move \(1 \, \text{C}\) of charge across the two points.",

    "correct_answer": "Each coulomb of charge receives \(6 \, \text{J}\) of energy.",
    "explanation": "The energy \(W\) given to a charge \(Q\) passing through a potential difference \(V\) is given by the equation \( W = V \times Q \). Here, \( V = 6 \, \text{V} \) and \( Q = 1 \, \text{C} \). Substituting these values:

    \[
    W = 6 \, \text{V} \times 1 \, \text{C} = 6 \, \text{J}
    \]

    Therefore, each coulomb of charge receives \(6 \, \text{J}\) of energy when passing through a \(6 \, \text{V}\) battery.",
