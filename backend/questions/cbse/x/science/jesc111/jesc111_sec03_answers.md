    "question_text": "On what factors does the resistance of a conductor depend?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The resistance \( R \) of a conductor depends on its length (\( l \)), cross-sectional area (\( A \)), and the nature of its material (resistivity, \( \rho \)). Specifically, resistance is directly proportional to the length and resistivity, and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. This relationship is given by the equation:\n\n\[ R = \rho \frac{l}{A} \]",
    "explanation": "According to the given content and Ohm's law, the resistance of a conductor is influenced by three main factors. First, the length of the conductor: increasing the length increases the resistance because electrons have to travel a longer path, encountering more obstacles. Second, the cross-sectional area: a larger area allows more electrons to pass through simultaneously, reducing resistance. Third, the material's resistivity: different materials inherently resist the flow of electrons to varying degrees; higher resistivity results in higher resistance. Combining these factors, the resistance is given by the formula \( R = \rho \frac{l}{A} \), demonstrating the dependence on length, area, and resistivity.",

    "question_text": "Will current flow more easily through a thick wire or a thin wire of the same material, when connected to the same source? Why?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Current will flow more easily through a thick wire because it has a larger cross-sectional area, resulting in lower resistance. According to Ohm's law \( I = \\frac{V}{R} \), lower resistance allows more current to pass through the wire.",
    "explanation": "A thick wire has a greater cross-sectional area \( A \), which inversely affects resistance \( R \) through the relation \( R \\propto \\frac{1}{A} \). Lower resistance means that for the same potential difference \( V \), the current \( I \) will be higher as \( I = \\frac{V}{R} \). Therefore, a thick wire facilitates easier flow of current compared to a thin wire made of the same material.",

    "question_text": "Let the resistance of an electrical component remain constant while the potential difference across the two ends of the component decreases to half of its former value. What change will occur in the current through it?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The current through the component will decrease to half of its original value.",
    "explanation": "According to Ohm's law, \( I = \\frac{V}{R} \). If the potential difference \( V \) is reduced to \( \\frac{V}{2} \) while the resistance \( R \) remains unchanged, the new current \( I' \) becomes:\n\n\[ I' = \\frac{\\frac{V}{2}}{R} = \\frac{I}{2} \\]\n\nThus, the current is halved.",

    "question_text": "Why are coils of electric toasters and electric irons made of an alloy rather than a pure metal?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Coils of electric toasters and electric irons are made of alloys like nichrome instead of pure metals because alloys have higher resistivity and better stability at high temperatures. Alloys do not oxidize or burn easily, enhancing the durability and efficiency of the heating elements in these appliances.",
    "explanation": "According to the provided content, alloys such as nichrome possess higher electrical resistivity compared to pure metals, making them more effective as heating elements by generating more heat for the same electric current. Additionally, alloys are more resistant to oxidation and corrosion at high temperatures, which prevents the coils from deteriorating quickly when subjected to prolonged heating. These properties make alloys more suitable than pure metals for use in devices like electric toasters and irons, where reliable and efficient heating is essential.",

Silver is the best conductor listed, with the lowest resistivity of \( 1.60 \\times 10^{-8} \\Omega \\cdot m \\).",
    "explanation": "a. From Table 11.2, the resistivity of iron is \( 10.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\Omega \\cdot m \\) and that of mercury is \( 94.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\Omega \\cdot m \\). Since lower resistivity indicates better conductivity, iron conducts electricity better than mercury.\n\nb.
