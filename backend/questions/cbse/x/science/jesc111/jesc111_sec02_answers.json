    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A battery or an electric cell.",
    "explanation": "A battery or an electric cell maintains a potential difference across a conductor by providing a constant voltage that drives the flow of electric charges through the circuit. This potential difference is essential for sustaining an electric current in the circuit.",

    "question_text": "What is meant by saying that the potential difference between two points is 1 V?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "It means that 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one point to the other.",
    "explanation": "The electric potential difference V between two points is defined as the work W done per unit charge Q to move the charge between those points. Mathematically, V = W / Q. Therefore, a potential difference of 1 V indicates that 1 J of work is required to move 1 C of charge across the two points.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Each coulomb of charge receives 6 J of energy.",
    "explanation": "The energy W given to a charge Q passing through a potential difference V is given by the equation W = V × Q. Here, V = 6 V and Q = 1 C. Substituting these values: W = 6 V × 1 C = 6 J. Therefore, each coulomb of charge receives 6 J of energy when passing through a 6 V battery.",
