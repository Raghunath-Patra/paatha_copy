    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The unit of electric current is the ampere (A). One ampere is equal to one coulomb of charge passing through a cross-section of a conductor per second, i.e., \(1 \, \text{A} = 1 \, \text{C/s}\).",
    "explanation": "The ampere is the SI unit for electric current. It is defined based on the flow of electric charge, where one ampere corresponds to the flow of one coulomb of charge every second.",

    "correct_answer": "In an electric circuit, the conventional direction of electric current is opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons.",
    "explanation": "Conventional current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of a power source. However, electrons, which are negatively charged, flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, making their flow opposite to the conventional current direction.",
