    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The unit of electric current is the ampere (A). One ampere is equal to one coulomb of charge passing through a cross-section of a conductor per second, i.e., 1 A = 1 C/s.",
    "explanation": "The ampere is the SI unit for electric current. It is defined based on the flow of electric charge, where one ampere corresponds to the flow of one coulomb of charge every second.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In an electric circuit, the conventional direction of electric current is opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons.",
    "explanation": "Conventional current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of a power source. However, electrons, which are negatively charged, flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, making their flow opposite to the conventional current direction.",

    "correct_answer": " Q = 2 A × 300 s = 600 C",

    "correct_answer": "Ammeter",
    "explanation": "An ammeter is specifically designed to measure electric current and is connected in series with the circuit. A voltmeter measures voltage, an ohmmeter measures resistance, and a galvanometer detects current but is not typically used for precise measurements in circuits.",

    "correct_answer": "In series with the component",
    "explanation": "An ammeter must be connected in series with the component whose current it is measuring to ensure that all the current flows through the ammeter. Connecting it in parallel would create a short circuit and potentially damage the instrument.",
