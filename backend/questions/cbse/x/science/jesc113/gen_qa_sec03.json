    "correct_answer": "The recycling process of plastics involves collection, sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting, and remolding into new products. This process reduces the need for raw materials, conserves energy, and decreases greenhouse gas emissions. However, it can also have environmental impacts such as energy consumption, potential release of pollutants during processing, and challenges with recycling certain types of plastics. Overall, recycling plastics helps mitigate pollution and resource depletion but must be managed sustainably to minimize negative impacts.",
