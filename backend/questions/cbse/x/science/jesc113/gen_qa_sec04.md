    "question_text": "Which of the following best explains why there are typically only 4-5 trophic levels in an ecosystem?",
    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": [
      "Limited availability of sunlight for producers.",
      "Decreasing energy as it moves up each trophic level.",
      "Increased competition among consumers at higher levels.",
      "Reduction in the number of producers."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Decreasing energy as it moves up each trophic level.",
    "explanation": "Energy decreases by approximately 90% at each trophic level due to the second law of thermodynamics. This significant energy loss limits the number of trophic levels an ecosystem can support, typically to 4-5 levels.",

  {
    "question_text": "Define the interdependence of ecosystem components and provide an example illustrating this concept.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Interdependence in an ecosystem refers to the mutual reliance between different components such as producers, consumers, and decomposers. For example, plants (producers) rely on decomposers to recycle nutrients from dead organisms, which in turn are consumed by herbivores, linking multiple parts of the ecosystem together.",
    "explanation": "Interdependence means that each component of an ecosystem affects and is affected by others. By providing an example, such as the relationship between producers, consumers, and decomposers, the answer demonstrates a clear understanding of how changes in one part can impact the whole system.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "100 kcal",
    "explanation": "Each trophic transfer typically loses about 90% of energy. So:\n- First trophic level (producers): 10,000 kcal\n- Second trophic level: 10,000 kcal × 10% = 1,000 kcal\n- Third trophic level: 1,000 kcal × 10% = 100 kcal",

    "question_text": "Which human activity is most directly responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer?",
    "type": "MCQ",

      "Deforestation",
      "Burning fossil fuels",
      "Use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)",
      "Overfishing"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)",
    "explanation": "CFCs are chemicals that release chlorine atoms in the stratosphere, which catalyze the destruction of ozone molecules. The other options do not have a direct impact on the ozone layer.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "CFCs deplete the ozone layer, which normally absorbs and blocks most UV radiation. When the ozone layer is weakened, more UV rays can pass through and reach the Earth's surface, potentially causing harm to living organisms.",
    "explanation": "The answer should describe the role of CFCs in ozone depletion and the consequence of a thinner ozone layer on UV radiation levels, demonstrating an understanding of the protective function of the ozone layer.",

      "Paper",
      "Glass bottles",
      "Leaves"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Glass bottles",
    "explanation": "Glass bottles do not decompose naturally and are considered non-biodegradable. Food scraps, paper, and leaves are biodegradable as they can be broken down by microorganisms.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Improper disposal of non-biodegradable waste leads to accumulation in landfills and natural habitats, causing pollution, harming wildlife, and contributing to the degradation of ecosystems. It can also result in the contamination of soil and water sources, posing risks to human health and biodiversity.",
    "explanation": "The response should cover multiple environmental impacts, illustrating an in-depth understanding of how non-biodegradable waste affects various aspects of the environment.",

      "Consumers",
      "Decomposers",
      "Producers",
      "Predators"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Producers",
    "explanation": "Producers, such as plants, perform photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Consumers and decomposers rely on producers or other consumers for energy, while predators are a type of consumer.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Human activities like deforestation, pollution, and overfishing can disrupt ecosystems by removing key species, introducing toxins, and altering habitats. This breaks the mutual dependencies among producers, consumers, and decomposers, leading to reduced biodiversity and ecosystem instability.",
    "explanation": "The answer should highlight specific human actions and their direct effects on the relationships and dependencies within the ecosystem, showing an understanding of interdependence.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Current waste management practices, such as recycling and incineration, help reduce the volume of non-biodegradable waste and recover some materials. However, challenges like inadequate infrastructure, low recycling rates, and the persistence of certain materials in the environment limit their effectiveness. Improvement is needed in technology, policy enforcement, and public participation to better mitigate environmental problems.",
    "explanation": "An effective evaluation should consider both the strengths and limitations of existing waste management strategies, providing a balanced analysis of their impact on environmental issues related to non-biodegradable waste.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A simple food chain could be: Grass (Producer) → Grasshopper (Primary Consumer) → Frog (Secondary Consumer) → Snake (Tertiary Consumer). \nEnergy flows as follows:\n- Grass converts solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis.\n- Grasshoppers consume grass, transferring energy to primary consumers.\n- Frogs eat grasshoppers, transferring energy to secondary consumers.\n- Snakes consume frogs, transferring energy to tertiary consumers.\nAt each step, approximately 10% of the energy is transferred to the next level, with significant energy loss due to metabolism and heat.",
    "explanation": "The answer provides a clear food chain with four trophic levels and explains the energy transfer at each step, incorporating the concept of energy loss using the 10% rule.",
