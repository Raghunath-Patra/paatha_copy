    "correct_answer": "An ecosystem is a community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. The biotic components include all living organisms such as plants, animals, and microorganisms. The abiotic components consist of non-living physical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil, and minerals.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Decomposers break down dead organisms and waste products into simpler inorganic substances, which are then returned to the soil and used by plants. This process helps in the natural replenishment of the soil nutrients.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The 10% rule states that only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next level. This is because a significant amount of energy is lost as heat, used for digestion, and in performing life processes.",
    "explanation": "The answer clearly explains the 10% rule, including the reasons for energy loss at each trophic level, which aligns with the information provided in the chapter.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 10 J of energy is available to the fourth trophic level.",
    "explanation": "Using the 10% rule:
First trophic level (producers): 10,000 J
Second trophic level: 10% of 10,000 J = 1,000 J
Third trophic level: 10% of 1,000 J = 100 J
Fourth trophic level: 10% of 100 J = 10 J",

      "C. Pesticide accumulation in predators",
      "D. Respiration in plants"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C. Pesticide accumulation in predators",
    "explanation": "Option C is correct because biological magnification refers to the increasing concentration of toxic substances like pesticides as they move up the food chain. Option A (Photosynthesis) and D (Respiration in plants) are processes related to energy and gas exchange, respectively, and are not related to toxin accumulation. Option B (Water evaporation) is a physical process unrelated to biological magnification.",

    "correct_answer": "Grass is at the first trophic level (producer), Rabbit is at the second trophic level (primary consumer), and Fox is at the third trophic level (secondary consumer).",
    "explanation": "Grass, being a producer, occupies the first trophic level. Rabbit, as a herbivore that consumes grass, is the primary consumer at the second level. Fox, as a carnivore that consumes rabbits, is the secondary consumer at the third trophic level.",

    "question_text": "Discuss why food chains typically have only three or four trophic levels.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Food chains typically have only three or four trophic levels because of the significant energy loss at each level due to the 10% rule. With each transfer, only about 10% of the energy is passed on, making it inefficient to support many higher trophic levels. As a result, only a limited number of energy transfers can occur before the available energy becomes too low to sustain additional levels.",
    "explanation": "The answer comprehensively explains the limitation on the number of trophic levels in food chains by referencing the 10% energy transfer rule and the resulting energy inefficiency, as described in the chapter.",

    "correct_answer": "A possible pond food web includes:
- **Phytoplankton** (producer) use photosynthesis to convert sunlight into energy.
- **Zooplankton** (primary consumer) feed on phytoplankton.
- **Small Fish** (secondary consumer) eat zooplankton.
- **Large Fish** (tertiary consumer) prey on small fish.
- **Birds** (quaternary consumer) such as herons feed on large fish.
Additionally, **Decomposers** like bacteria break down dead organisms at each trophic level, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem.",

      "C. Fox",
      "D. Bacteria"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B. Rabbit",
    "explanation": "Option B is correct because a rabbit is a herbivore that consumes producers like grass, making it a primary consumer. Option A (Grass) is a producer, Option C (Fox) is a secondary or tertiary consumer, and Option D (Bacteria) are decomposers.",

    "question_text": "Describe the process of biological magnification and its impact on humans.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Biological magnification is the process by which the concentration of toxic substances, such as pesticides, increases as they move up each trophic level in a food chain. These substances are not easily degradable and accumulate in the bodies of organisms. As a result, top predators, including humans, end up with higher concentrations of these toxins, which can lead to health issues such as cancer, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. This process highlights the dangers of using persistent pollutants in the environment.",
