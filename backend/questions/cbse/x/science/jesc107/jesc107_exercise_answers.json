    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sexual reproduction offers several advantages over asexual reproduction:\n\n1. **Genetic Variation**: By combining genetic material from two parents, sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity within a population. This diversity is crucial for evolution and adaptation to changing environments.\n\n2. **Elimination of Deleterious Mutations**: Sexual reproduction allows harmful mutations to be diluted through recombination and segregation, reducing the likelihood of these mutations being passed to future generations.\n\n3. **Adaptability**: Populations with higher genetic diversity are better equipped to survive diseases, climate changes, and other environmental stresses.\n\n4. **Evolutionary Benefits**: The genetic variation generated through sexual reproduction provides the raw material for natural selection, facilitating the evolution of species.\n\nIn contrast, asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring, limiting variation and adaptability.",
    "explanation": "Sexual reproduction promotes genetic diversity and adaptability, which are essential for the survival and evolution of species, whereas asexual reproduction results in genetically identical offspring offering less adaptability.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Menstruation occurs when the egg released during the menstrual cycle is not fertilized. In response, the uterus sheds its thickened lining, which was prepared to nourish a potential embryo. This lining breaks down and is expelled from the body through the vagina as menstrual blood and mucous.",
    "explanation": "Without fertilization, the thickened endometrial lining of the uterus, necessary for embryo nourishment, is no longer needed and is shed from the body as part of the menstrual cycle.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Unicellular and multicellular organisms exhibit distinct modes of reproduction reflecting their structural complexity:\n\n**Unicellular Organisms**:\n\n1. **Asexual Reproduction**:\n   - **Binary Fission**: The organism divides into two genetically identical daughter cells.\n   - **Multiple Fission**: The cell divides into several daughter cells simultaneously.\n   - **Budding**: A new organism grows as a bud from the parent and eventually detaches.\n\n   These methods allow rapid population growth since they do not require another individual.\n\n**Multicellular Organisms**:\n\n1. **Asexual Methods**:\n   - **Fragmentation**: The organism splits into fragments, each capable of developing into a new individual (e.g., Spirogyra).\n   - **Regeneration**: Specialized cells regenerate entire organisms from body parts (e.g., Hydra).\n\n2. **Sexual Reproduction**:\n   - Involves two specialized germ-cells from two parents combining to form a new individual.\n   - Requires meiosis to reduce chromosome number, ensuring offspring have a stable genome size.\n   - Facilitates genetic variation, enhancing adaptability and evolution.\n\n**Key Differences**:\n\n- **Complexity**: Multicellular organisms have specialized cells and structures making simple cell division insufficient, necessitating more complex processes.\n\n- **Genetic Variation**: Sexual reproduction in multicellular organisms introduces greater genetic diversity compared to primarily asexual reproduction in unicellular organisms.\n\n- **Mechanisms**: Multicellular organisms employ additional mechanisms like meiosis and fertilization, which are absent in unicellular reproduction.",
