      "Asexual reproduction involves two parents, while sexual reproduction involves only one.",
      "Asexual reproduction results in genetically identical offspring, whereas sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation.",
      "Asexual reproduction can only occur in plants, while sexual reproduction occurs in animals.",
      "Asexual reproduction requires the exchange of genetic material between individuals."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Asexual reproduction results in genetically identical offspring, whereas sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation.",
    "explanation": "Option B is correct because asexual reproduction involves a single parent and produces genetically identical offspring (clones), while sexual reproduction involves two parents and results in genetically diverse offspring due to the combination of genetic material. Option A is incorrect as it reverses the roles. Option C is wrong because asexual reproduction occurs in many organisms, including bacteria and some animals. Option D is incorrect as it describes sexual reproduction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Binary fission is an asexual reproduction method used by bacteria wherein a single bacterial cell divides into two identical daughter cells. The process involves the replication of the bacterial DNA, ensuring each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the genetic material. The cell then grows in size, and the plasma membrane and cell wall constrict in the middle, eventually splitting the cell into two separate entities. This efficient and rapid mode of reproduction allows bacterial populations to grow exponentially under favorable conditions.",
    "explanation": "Binary fission starts with the replication of the bacterial chromosome. As the DNA is duplicated, the cell elongates, positioning the two chromosomes at opposite ends. The cell membrane invaginates, and a septum forms to divide the cell into two daughter cells, each with an identical set of DNA. This process ensures that bacterial populations can quickly increase in number, which is crucial for survival and colonization in various environments.",

    "question_text": "How does the DNA copying mechanism during sexual reproduction contribute to genetic variation in a population? Provide a detailed explanation with relevant biological processes.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "During sexual reproduction, DNA copying mechanisms such as meiosis and independent assortment contribute to genetic variation. Meiosis involves two consecutive cell divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II) that result in four genetically unique haploid gametes from a diploid parent cell. Key processes like crossing over during prophase I allow for the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, creating new allele combinations. Additionally, independent assortment during metaphase I ensures that the chromosomes are distributed randomly to gametes. Fertilization further increases diversity by combining gametes from two different individuals, leading to offspring with unique genetic profiles. These mechanisms collectively enhance genetic variation, which is beneficial for the adaptation and survival of species.",
    "explanation": "Genetic variation is crucial for evolution and population resilience. Crossing over and independent assortment during meiosis shuffle alleles, creating new gene combinations. Fertilization merges distinct genetic materials from two parents, increasing diversity. This variation allows populations to adapt to changing environments and resist diseases, ensuring long-term survival.",

    "question_text": "Describe the process of pollination in flowering plants and explain its significance in sexual reproduction.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Pollination in flowering plants involves the transfer of pollen grains from the anther (male part) to the stigma (female part) of a flower. This process can occur through various agents such as wind, water, or pollinators like bees and butterflies. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma, it germinates, growing a pollen tube down through the style to the ovary, where fertilization occurs by the fusion of sperm with the ovule. Pollination is significant in sexual reproduction as it enables the combination of genetic material from two parent plants, leading to genetic diversity in the offspring, which enhances the adaptability and survival of plant species.",
    "explanation": "Pollination is the first step in sexual reproduction of flowering plants, ensuring that pollen reaches the female reproductive structures. This facilitates the genetic mixing that occurs during fertilization, resulting in seeds that grow into new plants with diverse genetic traits. Diverse genetic traits improve resilience against pests, diseases, and changing environmental conditions.",
