        "type": "Long Answer",
        "difficulty": "Medium",
        "options": null,
        "correct_answer": "Binary fission is a reproductive process where a unicellular organism like _Amoeba_ divides into two equal halves, each becoming a new individual. This division can occur in any plane, allowing flexibility in the splitting process. In contrast, multiple fission, observed in organisms like _Plasmodium_, involves the division of a single cell into many daughter cells simultaneously. While binary fission results in two offspring, multiple fission can produce several new individuals from one parent cell in a single division cycle.",
        "explanation": "Binary fission involves the splitting of a cell into two equal parts, typical of many unicellular organisms like _Amoeba_. Multiple fission, on the other hand, involves the division of one cell into multiple daughter cells at once, as seen in _Plasmodium_. The key difference lies in the number of offspring produced from a single division event.",

        "correct_answer": "Activity 7.1",
        "explanation": "Activity 7.1 involves adding yeast granules to a sugar solution and observing under a microscope, which demonstrates yeast budding as yeast cells produce small buds that separate and grow into new individuals. The other activities focus on different processes: Activity 7.3 observes binary fission in _Amoeba_, Activity 7.4 involves observing _Spirogyra_ filaments, and Activity 7.6 relates to propagating a money-plant.",

        "correct_answer": "Pieces with a notch or bud",
        "explanation": "Activity 7.5 involves cutting a potato into pieces with and without notches (buds). The observation reveals that only the pieces containing a notch or bud are capable of giving rise to fresh green shoots and roots. This is because the buds contain the necessary embryonic structures for growth, whereas pieces without notches lack these structures and do not develop into new plants.",

        "difficulty": "Hard",
        "options": null,
        "correct_answer": "Regeneration in _Hydra_ involves the ability of the organism to regrow entire individuals from its body parts. If a _Hydra_ is cut into multiple pieces, each piece can develop into a complete organism. This process is facilitated by specialized cells that proliferate and differentiate into various cell types and tissues in an organized sequence known as development. Unlike typical reproductive methods, regeneration is not primarily used for reproduction under normal conditions; it is a response to injury or splitting, whereas reproduction usually involves creating new individuals through specific reproductive mechanisms like budding or fission.",
        "explanation": "Regeneration allows _Hydra_ to recover from physical damage by growing new parts from existing cells. This differs from typical reproduction as it does not normally serve to produce new individuals unless the organism is split. Unlike reproductive processes that are regulated and serve the primary purpose of creating offspring, regeneration is a method of growth and repair, although it can result in new organisms if the conditions lead to fragmentation.",

        "explanation": "Sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two parents, which is different from asexual reproduction modes such as binary fission, budding, and vegetative propagation that do not require gametes from another organism.

        "options": null,
        "correct_answer": "Tissue culture involves growing new plants by removing tissue or separating cells from the plant's growing tip and placing them in an artificial medium. These cells divide rapidly to form a callus, which is then transferred to another medium containing hormones that promote growth and differentiation into plantlets. The plantlets are later transferred to soil to mature. Advantages include the ability to produce a large number of disease-free plants, faster production of plants ready to bear flowers and fruits, and the ability to propagate plants that cannot produce seeds.",
        "explanation": "Tissue culture allows precise control over the growing environment, ensuring rapid and uniform plant growth. It is particularly useful for propagating ornamental plants and those that have lost seed-producing capabilities. By handling the cells in sterile, controlled conditions, tissue culture minimizes the risk of disease and ensures genetic consistency among the propagated plants.",

        "options": null,
        "correct_answer": "In _Rhizopus_, spore formation occurs in structures called sporangia, which are tiny blob-on-a-stick structures. These sporangia contain spores that are covered by thick walls to protect them until they land on a moist surface where they can germinate and develop into new _Rhizopus_ individuals. This mode of reproduction allows the spores to survive unfavorable conditions and disperse to new environments for growth.",
        "explanation": "Sporangia serve as protective containers for spores, ensuring their survival during adverse conditions. Upon finding a suitable moist environment, the spores release and begin to grow, leading to the formation of new individuals. This method is effective for the spread and propagation of _Rhizopus_, especially in environments where spores can easily disperse and colonize new substrates.",

        "difficulty": "Hard",
        "options": null,
        "correct_answer": "Fission and fragmentation are both modes of asexual reproduction but differ in their mechanisms. Fission involves the division of a single organism or cell into two or more new individuals of roughly equal size, as seen in binary fission of bacteria or budding in yeast. It is typically observed in unicellular organisms. Fragmentation, on the other hand, involves the breaking of an organism into fragments, each of which can grow into a new individual. This method is common in multicellular organisms with simple body structures, such as _Spirogyra_. While fission is a controlled cell division process, fragmentation relies on physical breaking and subsequent growth of the pieces. Both methods result in genetically identical offspring but are suited to different types of organisms based on their complexity and cellular organization.",
        "explanation": "Fission is primarily a cellular process suitable for single-celled organisms, ensuring each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic material. Fragmentation is applicable to multicellular organisms with simple structures, allowing parts to develop into whole organisms. The key contrast lies in the organizational complexity and the mechanism by which new individuals are formed.",

        "type": "Short Answer",
        "difficulty": "Hard",
        "options": null,
        "correct_answer": "Multi-cellular organisms cannot reproduce by simply dividing cell-by-cell because their cells are highly specialized and organized into tissues and organs with specific functions and positions. Random cell division would disrupt this intricate organization, making it impractical for the entire organism to function correctly. Instead, multi-cellular organisms use more complex reproductive methods that involve specific cell types capable of growth, proliferation, and differentiation to maintain the organism's structural and functional integrity during reproduction.",
        "explanation": "The complexity of multi-cellular organisms requires that cells work in a coordinated manner to maintain the organism's structure and function. Simple cell division would not preserve the necessary organization, leading to dysfunctional offspring. Specialized reproductive cells ensure that new individuals develop correctly with the right cell types and body structures.",

        "type": "Short Answer",
        "difficulty": "Medium",
        "options": null,
        "correct_answer": "Regeneration is the ability of an organism to grow new individuals from its body parts when it is cut or broken. For example, _Hydra_ and _Planaria_ can regenerate complete organisms from fragments. This differs from regular reproduction because regeneration typically occurs as a response to injury or fragmentation rather than as a standard method of producing offspring. While regeneration involves the growth of new parts into a complete organism, regular reproduction is a planned and specialized process for creating new individuals.",
        "explanation": "Regeneration serves as a repair mechanism for an organism, allowing it to recover from damage by growing new parts. In contrast, regular reproduction is a controlled biological process aimed at producing new individuals to ensure the continuation of the species. Regeneration does not normally serve as a primary reproductive strategy.",
