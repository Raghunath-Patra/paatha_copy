    "question_text": "What advantage over an aquatic organism does a terrestrial organism have with regard to obtaining oxygen for respiration?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Terrestrial organisms have access to atmospheric oxygen, which is present in much higher concentrations compared to the dissolved oxygen available in water for aquatic organisms. This allows terrestrial organisms to obtain oxygen more efficiently and sustain higher metabolic rates necessary for various life processes.",
    "explanation": "Aquatic organisms rely on dissolved oxygen in water, which is limited in concentration due to water's low oxygen solubility. In contrast, terrestrial organisms can directly access atmospheric oxygen, which is abundant (approximately 21% of air by volume). This higher availability of oxygen facilitates more efficient respiration, enabling terrestrial organisms to support more active lifestyles and higher energy demands.",

    "question_text": "What are the different ways in which glucose is oxidised to provide energy in various organisms?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Glucose is oxidised through different metabolic pathways depending on the presence of oxygen and the type of organism. In aerobic respiration, which occurs in the presence of oxygen, glucose is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria, yielding approximately 30.5 kJ/mol of energy. This involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. In anaerobic respiration, which occurs without oxygen, organisms like yeast convert glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide through fermentation, producing a smaller amount of energy. In animal muscle cells, in the absence of oxygen, glucose is converted into lactic acid, leading to the production of a limited amount of energy and the accumulation of lactic acid.",
    "explanation": "The oxidation of glucose begins with glycolysis in the cytoplasm, where glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate (C₃H₄O₃). In aerobic respiration, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is further oxidised in the Krebs cycle, producing carbon dioxide (CO₂) and transferring electrons to the electron transport chain, generating a substantial amount of ATP. In anaerobic conditions, such as fermentation, yeast convert pyruvate into ethanol (C₂H₅OH) and CO₂, while animal cells convert pyruvate into lactic acid (C₃H₆O₃). These anaerobic pathways regenerate NAD⁺ needed for glycolysis but yield less energy compared to aerobic respiration.",

    "question_text": "How is oxygen and carbon dioxide transported in human beings?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In human beings, oxygen is primarily transported by hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells. Each hemoglobin molecule can bind up to four oxygen molecules in the lungs, where oxygen concentration is high, and release them in tissues where oxygen concentration is low. Carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is transported in three forms: dissolved directly in the blood plasma, chemically bound to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin, and as bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) formed from carbon dioxide and water via the enzyme carbonic anhydrase within red blood cells. The majority of carbon dioxide is transported in the form of bicarbonate ions.",
    "explanation": "When blood passes through the alveoli in the lungs, oxygen diffuses into the blood and binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, forming oxyhemoglobin. This binding is facilitated by the partial pressure gradient of oxygen. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide produced by cellular metabolism diffuses from tissues into the blood. Approximately 10-20% of carbon dioxide is dissolved in plasma, around 20-30% binds to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin, and about 50-70% is converted to bicarbonate ions through a reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase:
    
    \[
    \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{HCO}_3^-
    \]
    
    In the lungs, bicarbonate ions are converted back to carbon dioxide, which is then exhaled, completing the transport cycle.",

    "question_text": "How are the lungs designed in human beings to maximise the area for exchange of gases?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Human lungs are structured with a vast network of branching airways that lead to millions of alveoli, which are tiny balloon-like sacs. This design significantly increases the surface area available for gas exchange, approximately 80 m² in total. The alveoli walls are extremely thin and are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, ensuring that oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse efficiently between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the capillaries.",
    "explanation": "The lungs are divided into bronchi and bronchioles, which branch repeatedly to increase the surface area. Each bronchiole ends in clusters of alveoli, providing a large number of sites for gas exchange. The thin walls of alveoli (one cell thick) and the close proximity to capillaries facilitate rapid diffusion of oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of the blood. Additionally, the extensive surface area of approximately 80 m² ensures that a sufficient amount of gas can be exchanged quickly to meet the body's metabolic demands. The combination of numerous alveoli, thin membranes, and rich blood supply optimizes the efficiency of respiration.",
