    "question_text": "What are the differences between autotrophic nutrition and heterotrophic nutrition?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Autotrophic nutrition and heterotrophic nutrition are two fundamental modes by which organisms obtain energy and materials for growth and maintenance. Autotrophs, such as green plants and certain bacteria, produce their own food through processes like photosynthesis, utilizing inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to synthesize carbohydrates. They convert light energy into chemical energy, storing it in the form of starch or glycogen. In contrast, heterotrophs, including animals and fungi, cannot synthesize their own food and rely on consuming complex organic substances. These complex molecules must be broken down into simpler forms using bio-catalysts called enzymes before they can be utilized for energy and growth. Moreover, heterotrophs are directly or indirectly dependent on autotrophs for their energy and material needs.",
    "explanation": "The answer distinguishes between autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition by outlining their sources of energy and materials, the processes they use to obtain and store energy, and their interdependence. Autotrophs are defined by their ability to produce food from inorganic sources via photosynthesis, while heterotrophs must consume organic substances and rely on enzymes to break them down. Additionally, the dependency of heterotrophs on autotrophs is highlighted, showcasing the ecological relationship between these two nutritional modes.",

    "question_text": "Where do plants get each of the raw materials required for photosynthesis?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Plants obtain the raw materials required for photosynthesis from different sources. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is absorbed from the atmosphere through stomata, which are tiny pores on the surfaces of leaves and other plant parts. Water (H₂O) is absorbed from the soil through the plant's roots. Sunlight is captured by chlorophyll present in the chloroplasts within the plant cells, particularly in the green parts of the leaves. Additionally, plants take up essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and magnesium from the soil, which are necessary for various biochemical processes, including the synthesis of proteins and other vital compounds.",
    "explanation": "The response identifies each raw material necessary for photosynthesis and specifies their sources. Carbon dioxide enters the plant through stomata, water is absorbed by roots from the soil, and sunlight is captured by chlorophyll in chloroplasts. It also mentions the uptake of essential nutrients from the soil, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of photosynthesis and the various sources plants rely on to perform this process effectively.",

    "question_text": "What is the role of the acid in our stomach?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The acid in our stomach, primarily hydrochloric acid (HCl), serves multiple functions: it creates an acidic environment that activates the protein-digesting enzyme pepsin, which breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. Additionally, the acidic medium helps kill harmful microorganisms ingested with food, thus protecting the body from infections.",
    "explanation": "The answer succinctly explains that hydrochloric acid in the stomach activates pepsin, aiding in protein digestion, and also serves a protective role by eliminating harmful microbes. This addresses both the digestive and protective functions of stomach acid as described in the provided content.",

    "question_text": "What is the function of digestive enzymes?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Digestive enzymes act as biological catalysts that facilitate the breakdown of complex food molecules into simpler forms that can be absorbed and utilized by the body. For example, salivary amylase breaks down starch into simple sugars, pepsin digests proteins into peptides, and lipase breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol.",
    "explanation": "The response clearly identifies the role of digestive enzymes as catalysts that decompose complex molecules into simpler ones, enabling absorption and utilization. Specific examples of enzymes and their corresponding functions are provided, aligning with the information in the content.",

    "question_text": "How is the small intestine designed to absorb digested food?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The small intestine is intricately designed to maximize the absorption of digested food through several structural adaptations. It features a highly folded inner surface with numerous finger-like projections called villi, which significantly increase the surface area available for absorption. Each villus is covered with microvilli, further enhancing the absorptive capacity. The villi are richly supplied with blood vessels, including capillaries and lacteals, which transport absorbed nutrients into the bloodstream and lymphatic system, respectively. Additionally, the small intestine secretes digestive enzymes and receives bile from the liver and pancreatic juices, which aid in the complete digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The coiled and elongated structure of the small intestine provides ample space for these processes, ensuring efficient nutrient uptake.",
    "explanation": "The answer describes the structural features of the small intestine, such as villi and microvilli, which increase surface area for absorption. It also mentions the vascular supply that facilitates nutrient transport and the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile that aid in digestion. The coiled design is noted as a means to maximize the space for absorption, all of which contribute to the efficient absorption of digested food as detailed in the content.",
