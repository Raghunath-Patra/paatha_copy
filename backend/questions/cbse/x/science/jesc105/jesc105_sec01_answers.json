    "question_text": "Why is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multicellular organisms like humans?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Diffusion is insufficient because the distance oxygen molecules need to travel to reach all cells in a multicellular organism is too great for diffusion to provide oxygen quickly and efficiently, necessitating specialized transportation systems like the circulatory system to meet oxygen demands.",
    "explanation": "Diffusion is ax passive process where molecules move from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. In unicellular organisms, diffusion can easily supply oxygen to the entire cell due to the small size. However, in multicellular organisms like humans, cells are located far from the oxygen source (e.g., lungs), making diffusion too slow and inefficient to meet the oxygen needs of all cells. Therefore, specialized systems, such as the circulatory system with red blood cells, are necessary to transport oxygen rapidly and efficiently throughout the organism.",

    "question_text": "What criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "We use several criteria to determine if something is alive, including the ability to grow, reproduce, respond to stimuli, maintain homeostasis, undergo metabolism, and possess cellular organization.",
    "explanation": "To classify something as living, biologists examine key life processes and characteristics. These criteria include:\n\n1. **Growth**: Living organisms increase in size over time.\n2. **Reproduction**: The ability to produce new individuals.\n3. **Response to Stimuli**: Reacting to environmental changes.\n4. **Homeostasis**: Maintaining internal balance despite external changes.\n5. **Metabolism**: Performing chemical reactions to obtain and use energy.\n6. **Cellular Organization**: Composed of one or more cells, the basic units of life.\n\nThese criteria help distinguish living organisms from non-living entities.",

    "question_text": "What are outside raw materials used for by an organism?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Outside raw materials are used by organisms as sources of energy and building blocks for growth, maintenance, and repair of their structures.",
    "explanation": "Organisms obtain raw materials from their environment, primarily carbon-based molecules, which serve multiple functions:\n\n1. **Energy Production**: Raw materials, such as carbohydrates and fats, are broken down through metabolic processes (e.g., respiration) to release energy necessary for life processes.\n2. **Growth and Repair**: These materials provide the necessary components (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids) to build and maintain cellular structures and organisms.\n3. **Metabolic Processes**: They participate in various biochemical reactions essential for maintaining homeostasis.\n4. **Storage**: Excess raw materials can be stored for future use when energy or building block demands are higher.\n\nTherefore, external raw materials are integral for sustaining life, enabling organisms to grow, reproduce, and maintain their structures.",

    "question_text": "What processes would you consider essential for maintaining life?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Essential processes for maintaining life include nutrition, respiration, transportation of nutrients and gases, excretion of waste products, growth, reproduction, and maintenance of homeostasis.",
    "explanation": "Maintaining life requires several interconnected biological processes:\n\n1. **Nutrition**: The intake and processing of food to obtain energy and building blocks. This involves ingestion, digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients.\n\n2. **Respiration**: The process of breaking down food molecules to release energy, typically involving the intake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide.\n\n3. **Transportation**: The distribution of nutrients, gases, and other molecules throughout the organism, usually via specialized systems like the circulatory system in multicellular organisms.\n\n4. **Excretion**: Removal of metabolic waste products to prevent accumulation of harmful substances. This helps maintain internal balance and prevents damage to cells and tissues.\n\n5. **Growth**: Increase in size and number of cells, enabling the organism to develop and replace damaged parts.\n\n6. **Reproduction**: The production of new individuals to ensure the survival of the species.\n\n7. **Homeostasis**: Maintenance of a stable internal environment despite external changes, involving regulation of variables like temperature, pH, and ion concentrations.\n\nThese processes work together to sustain the structured organization of living organisms, repair damage, and adapt to environmental changes.",
