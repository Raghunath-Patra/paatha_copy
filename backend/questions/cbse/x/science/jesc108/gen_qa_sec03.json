    "correct_answer": "Variations arising during reproduction, such as mutations or recombination of genes, can be passed on to the offspring through the genetic material (DNA). These inherited variations contribute to the genetic diversity of the population.",
    "explanation": "During reproduction, genetic information from both parents combines. Any new variations that occur, like mutations or the recombination of alleles, can be transmitted to the offspring via their DNA. This ensures that the offspring have a unique combination of traits, and these variations are inherited by subsequent generations.",

    "correct_answer": "Inherited variations can provide individuals with advantageous traits that enhance their ability to survive and reproduce in their environment. For example, a variation that allows better camouflage can help an individual avoid predators.",
    "explanation": "Variations that confer benefits, such as improved camouflage, resistance to diseases, or more efficient metabolism, can increase an individual's chances of surviving challenges in their environment. These traits make the individuals more likely to reproduce and pass on the advantageous variations to the next generation, thereby increasing their prevalence in the population.",

    "correct_answer": "aa",
    "explanation": "Option 'AA' represents a homozygous dominant genotype, which will express the dominant trait. Option 'Aa' is heterozygous, where the dominant allele 'A' masks the recessive allele 'a', resulting in the expression of the dominant trait. Option 'A-' is not a standard genotype notation but suggests the presence of at least one dominant allele. Only 'aa' is homozygous recessive, allowing the recessive trait to be expressed.",

    "correct_answer": "Recessive alleles can only be expressed in the absence of dominant alleles.",
    "explanation": "Option A is incorrect because dominance does not relate to the frequency in the population. Option B is correct as recessive alleles are expressed only when both alleles are recessive (homozygous recessive). Option C is incorrect because dominant alleles mask, not enhance, the recessive alleles. Option D is incorrect because recessive alleles are not expressed when a dominant allele is present.",

    "correct_answer": "Each pair of alleles segregates independently from other pairs during gamete formation.",
    "explanation": "Option A is incorrect as this describes linked genes, which do not assort independently. Option B correctly describes independent assortment, where different genes for different traits are passed independently of one another.

    "explanation": "According to the law of independent assortment, when gametes are formed, the segregation of alleles for one trait does not influence the segregation of alleles for another trait.
