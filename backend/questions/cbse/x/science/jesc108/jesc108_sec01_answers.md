    "question_text": "If a trait \( A \) exists in 10\\% of a population of an asexually reproducing species and a trait \( B \) exists in 60\\% of the same population, which trait is likely to have arisen earlier?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Trait \( B \) is likely to have arisen earlier in the population.",
    "explanation": "In asexually reproducing species, genetic variations arise primarily due to mutations during DNA replication. Since trait \( B \) is present in a larger proportion of the population (60\\%) compared to trait \( A \) (10\\%), it suggests that trait \( B \) emerged earlier. This higher frequency indicates that trait \( B \) had more time to proliferate within the population, whereas trait \( A \) is less common, possibly representing a more recent mutation or a trait that confers less of a reproductive advantage.",

    "question_text": "How does the creation of variations in a species promote survival?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The creation of variations in a species enhances survival by providing a diverse pool of traits that can better adapt to changing environmental conditions, resist diseases, and exploit different ecological niches.",
    "explanation": "Variation within a species is crucial for survival as it introduces a range of traits among individuals. This diversity means that some individuals are more likely to possess characteristics that are advantageous under specific environmental pressures, such as extreme temperatures, availability of food resources, or the presence of predators and diseases. For example, in a population with varied traits, if a sudden heatwave occurs, individuals with traits that confer heat resistance are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those beneficial traits to the next generation. Similarly, genetic variation allows for adaptability over generations, ensuring the species can withstand changes and continue to thrive. Without such variation, a species may be more vulnerable to extinction if it cannot adapt to environmental changes.",
