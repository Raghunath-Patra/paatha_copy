    "correct_answer": "The focal length of the convex mirror is 16 cm.",
    "explanation": "To find the focal length (f) of a spherical mirror, we use the relationship between the focal length and the radius of curvature (R):

\[ f = \frac{R}{2} \]

Given that the mirror is convex, we follow the New Cartesian Sign Convention:

- Radius of curvature, \( R = +32 \, \text{cm} \) (positive for convex mirrors).

Substituting the given value:

\[ f = \frac{32 \, \text{cm}}{2} = +16 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the focal length of the convex mirror is \( +16 \, \text{cm} \). The positive sign indicates that the focal point is located behind the mirror, which is consistent with the nature of convex mirrors.",

    "question_text": "A concave mirror produces a three times magnified (enlarged) real image of an object placed at 10 cm in front of it. Where is the image located?",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The image is located at -30 cm from the mirror.",
    "explanation": "To determine the image distance (v) for a concave mirror, we can use the magnification formula and the mirror formula.

**Given:**

- Object distance, \( u = -10 \, \text{cm} \) (object is in front of the mirror).
- Magnification, \( m = 3 \) (enlarged), and since the image is real, \( m \) is negative as per the sign convention:
  
  \[ m = -\frac{v}{u} \]
  
  Therefore:
  
  \[ -3 = -\frac{v}{-10} \]
  
  \[ -3 = \frac{v}{10} \]
  
  \[ v = -30 \, \text{cm} \]

**Interpretation:**

- The negative image distance \( v = -30 \, \text{cm} \) indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is characteristic of real images in concave mirrors.

**Summary:**

- Image distance, \( v = -30 \, \text{cm} \)
- The negative sign denotes that the image is real and formed 30 cm in front of the mirror.
