    "correct_answer": "The image formation by a concave mirror varies based on the object's position relative to the center of curvature \( C \) and the focal point \( F \):

- **Object beyond \( C \) (Centre of Curvature):** The image is formed between \( F \) and \( C \). It is real, inverted, and diminished.
  
- **Object at \( C \):** The image is formed at \( C \). It is real, inverted, and the same size as the object.
  
- **Object between \( C \) and \( F \):** The image is formed beyond \( C \). It is real, inverted, and enlarged.
  
- **Object at \( F \):** The reflected rays become parallel, and the image is formed at infinity. No image is formed on the screen.

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Using the mirror equation \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} \):

Given:
- \( f = 10 \, \text{cm} \) (concave mirror, so \( f = 10 \, \text{cm} \))
- \( u = -40 \, \text{cm} \) (object distance is negative in mirror conventions)

Substituting:
\( \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{-40} \)
\( \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{40} = \frac{4}{40} + \frac{1}{40} = \frac{5}{40} = \frac{1}{8} \)
\( v = 8 \, \text{cm} \)

Since \( v \) is positive, the image is real and formed \( 8 \, \text{cm} \) in front of the mirror. Given that \( u > C \) (where \( C = 20 \, \text{cm} \)), the image is between \( F \) and \( C \), real, inverted, and diminished.",
    "explanation": "Using the mirror formula and sign conventions, the image distance \( v \) is calculated to be \( 8 \, \text{cm} \). A positive \( v \) indicates a real image.

Option a) is incorrect as \( f \) is not equal to \( R \). Option b) gives the correct magnitude but misses the negative sign, which is crucial for convex mirrors.

    "correct_answer": "Convex mirrors are widely used in various applications that require a wide field of view and enhanced safety features. Common applications include:

- **Rear-view (Wing) Mirrors in Vehicles:** They allow drivers to see a larger area behind them, reducing blind spots and enhancing safety while driving.
  
- **Side Mirrors on Vehicles:** Positioned on the sides, they provide drivers with a comprehensive view of the areas beside and behind the vehicle.
  
- **Security Mirrors in Stores and Public Places:** Installed at ceilings or strategic points, they help in monitoring large areas to prevent theft and ensure safety.
  
- **Road Safety Mirrors:** Placed at bends, intersections, and other hazardous spots to allow drivers to see oncoming traffic without obstructing their view.
  
- **Reflective Surfaces in Architectural Designs:** Sometimes used in terraces or specific structures like Agra Fort to provide panoramic views of landmarks such as the Taj Mahal.

Convex mirrors are suitable for these applications because they always produce virtual, erect, and diminished images, which allow for a wider field of view compared to plane or concave mirrors. Their outward curvature enables them to reflect light from a broader range of angles, making them ideal for surveillance and safety purposes where seeing as much area as possible is essential.",
    "explanation": "Convex mirrors' ability to provide a wide field of view due to their outward curvature makes them indispensable in applications where monitoring large areas is crucial. Their image properties ensure that even large objects can be viewed entirely within a small mirror, enhancing visibility and safety in various environments.",
