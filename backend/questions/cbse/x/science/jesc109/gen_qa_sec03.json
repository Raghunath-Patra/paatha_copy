    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When light enters a glass slab parallel to its base, it bends towards the normal upon entering the denser medium and then bends away from the normal when exiting into the rarer medium. The two bends are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in the emergent ray being parallel to the incident ray.",
    "explanation": "As per Activity 9.10 and the content, the light ray bends twice at the parallel surfaces of the glass slab. The first refraction towards the normal occurs when entering the glass from air, and the second refraction away from the normal occurs when exiting the glass back to air. These two bends cancel each other out direction-wise, keeping the emergent ray parallel to the incident ray.",

    "correct_answer": "Kerosene has a higher refractive index (1.44) compared to water (1.33). This means that the change in the direction of light rays is less when light enters kerosene from air compared to water from air. As a result, the apparent displacement of the pencil in kerosene is less than in water.",
    "explanation": "The extent of apparent displacement depends on the refractive index of the medium. Higher refractive index means more bending towards the normal when light enters the medium from a rarer medium.
