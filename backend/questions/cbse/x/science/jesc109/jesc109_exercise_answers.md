    "correct_answer": "4. Between the pole of the mirror and its principal focus",
    "explanation": "For a concave mirror, when the object is placed between the pole (P) and the principal focus (F), the image formed is virtual, erect, and magnified. This is because the reflected rays diverge, and the eye perceives them as coming from a larger, upright image behind the mirror.",

In this case, the image formed is real, inverted, and highly diminished, approaching a point. However, None of the options directly correspond to obtaining an image of the same size.

    "explanation": "For a concave mirror, erect and virtual images are formed when the object is placed between the pole (P) and the principal focus (F).

This results in only half of the image being formed, causing the image to appear incomplete or partially obscured.
