    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The principal focus of a concave mirror is the point on the principal axis where parallel rays of light incident on the mirror converge after reflection.",
    "explanation": "In a concave mirror, parallel rays of light that are parallel to the principal axis reflect and converge at a specific point known as the principal focus (F). This point is located halfway between the pole (P) of the mirror and its center of curvature (C). The principal focus is crucial in determining the behavior of image formation by concave mirrors.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "10 cm",
    "explanation": "The relationship between the radius of curvature (R) and the focal length (f) of a spherical mirror is given by the equation R = 2f. Given the radius of curvature R = 20 cm, we can find the focal length f by rearranging the equation: f = R/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A concave mirror can produce an erect and enlarged image of an object when the object is placed between the pole (P) and the principal focus (F).",
    "explanation": "Concave mirrors have the ability to form different types of images based on the object's position relative to the principal focus (F) and the center of curvature (C). When the object is placed between P and F, the mirror forms a virtual, erect, and enlarged image. This is because the reflected rays diverge, and the brain perceives them as coming from a larger behind-the-mirror position.",

    "question_text": "Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Convex mirrors are preferred as rear-view mirrors in vehicles because they always produce erect and diminished images while offering a wider field of view. This allows drivers to see a larger area behind the vehicle, enhancing safety by reducing blind spots.",
    "explanation": "Convex mirrors curve outward, which causes reflected rays to diverge. This results in images that are virtual, erect, and smaller than the actual object. The outward curvature also provides a wider field of view compared to flat or concave mirrors, allowing drivers to monitor more traffic and surroundings, thereby increasing safety on the road.",
