    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "The paper burns because the convex lens converges parallel rays of sunlight to a focal point. This concentration of light increases the energy per unit area at the focal point, generating sufficient heat to ignite the paper. The real, inverted image of the Sun formed at the focal point has a high intensity of light, leading to burning.",
    "explanation": "In Activity 9.11, parallel rays of sunlight pass through the convex lens and are converged at the principal focus, creating a highly concentrated spot of light. This concentration increases the temperature at that point, providing enough thermal energy to burn the paper placed there. The real image of the Sun at the focal point has a significantly higher energy density, resulting in burning.",
