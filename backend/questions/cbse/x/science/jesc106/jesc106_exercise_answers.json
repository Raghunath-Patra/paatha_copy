    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Phototropism in plants occurs when plant parts, such as shoots, grow towards a light source. This process involves the redistribution of the plant hormone auxin to the shaded side of the stem, causing cells on that side to elongate more than those on the light-exposed side. As a result, the plant bends towards the light, optimizing light absorption for photosynthesis.",
    "explanation": "Phototropism involves the plant hormone auxin, which regulates growth direction by promoting cell elongation on the side away from light, causing the plant to bend towards the light source.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Chemical coordination in plants occurs through the action of hormones, which are chemical messengers synthesized in one part of the plant and transported to other parts to regulate growth, development, and responses to stimuli. Examples include auxin for phototropism, gibberellins for stem elongation, cytokinins for cell division, and abscisic acid for stress responses. These hormones diffuse through plant tissues or are transported via the vascular system to effect changes in target cells.",
    "explanation": "Plants lack a nervous system, so they rely on hormones for internal communication. These hormones coordinate various physiological processes by signaling specific responses in different parts of the plant.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Involuntary actions are those that occur without conscious control, such as heartbeat, digestion, and breathing, and are primarily regulated by the autonomic nervous system and the brain. Reflex actions are a subset of involuntary actions that are immediate and automatic responses to specific stimuli without the involvement of the brain, typically mediated by the spinal cord. For example, pulling a hand away from a hot surface is a reflex action involving a reflex arc, whereas maintaining heart rate is an involuntary action controlled by the brain.",
    "explanation": "While all reflex actions are involuntary, not all involuntary actions are reflexes. Reflex actions are specific, rapid responses to stimuli, whereas involuntary actions include a broader range of automatic bodily functions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Movement in sensitive plants and human legs occurs through fundamentally different mechanisms **Sensitive Plant Movement:** - **Mechanism:** Involuntary movements caused by changes in turgor pressure within specialized cells called motor cells in the pulvini (joint-like regions). - **Control:** Hormonal signals (like rapid changes in ion concentration leading to water movement) trigger swelling or shrinking of cells, resulting in movement.- **Speed:** Relatively slow, typically occurring over seconds to minutes. - **Structure:** Plants lack muscles and a nervous system; movement is achieved through cell elongation and water movement. **Human Leg Movement:** - **Mechanism:** Voluntary movement controlled by the nervous system. - **Control:** Electrical impulses from the brain and spinal cord travel through motor neurons to muscle fibers, causing muscle contraction and movement. - **Speed:** Rapid, occurring in milliseconds to seconds. - **Structure:** Involves muscles, tendons, bones, and a complex nervous system for precise and coordinated movements. **Key Differences:** - **Control Systems:** Plants use hormonal and chemical signals; humans use electrical nerve impulses. - **Speed and Precision:** Human movements are faster and more precise; plant movements are slower and less precise. - **Structures Involved:** Plants rely on cell turgor and structural changes; humans have specialized muscles and a skeletal system for movement.",
