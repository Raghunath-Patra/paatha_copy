    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electrical impulses, known as action potentials, travel along neurons by the movement of ions across the neuron's membrane. This process involves the depolarization and repolarization of the neuron, allowing the signal to propagate from one end of the neuron to the other.",
    "explanation": "Electrical impulses are generated by the movement of sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺) ions, creating a wave of electrical change that travels along the axon. This allows for rapid communication within the nervous system, enabling quick responses to stimuli.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "False",
    "explanation": "Chemical coordination is observed in both plants and animals. In plants, hormones like auxins and gibberellins regulate growth and responses to the environment, while in animals, hormones like insulin and adrenaline manage various physiological processes.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hormones are chemical messengers produced by endocrine glands that travel through the bloodstream to target organs or tissues, where they elicit specific responses. For example, the hormone insulin regulates blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells, thereby lowering blood sugar levels.",
    "explanation": "Hormones ensure that different parts of the body communicate effectively to maintain homeostasis. Insulin is released by the pancreas in response to high blood sugar and acts on cells to promote glucose uptake, illustrating how hormones coordinate metabolic activities.",

    "correct_answer": "A loop where the output of a system regulates its own activity",
    "explanation": "A feedback mechanism involves the output influencing further activity, such as the regulation of hormone levels through negative feedback.

    "correct_answer": "Voluntary action is a type of nervous system response that is under conscious control, such as deciding to move a muscle to pick up an object.",

    "correct_answer": "Sense organs detect stimuli from the environment and send information to the nervous system, which processes the data and triggers appropriate responses through muscle actions.",
    "explanation": "Sense organs such as eyes, ears, and skin gather sensory information like light, sound, and touch. This information is transmitted via neurons to the brain and spinal cord, where it is interpreted, leading to coordinated actions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Reflex actions are rapid, automatic responses to specific external stimuli that do not involve conscious thought, such as the knee-jerk reaction. Involuntary actions, while also not under conscious control, encompass a broader range of physiological processes, including internal functions like heartbeat and digestion. Both types of actions are controlled by the autonomic nervous system, but reflex actions are specifically triggered by external events, whereas involuntary actions include ongoing internal regulatory functions.",
    "explanation": "While both reflex and involuntary actions lack conscious control, reflex actions are immediate responses to external stimuli, ensuring quick reactions to potential dangers. In contrast, involuntary actions include essential bodily processes that maintain homeostasis without direct external triggers.",

    "question_text": "Explain how negative feedback mechanisms maintain hormonal balance in the body, providing a specific example.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Negative feedback mechanisms maintain hormonal balance by adjusting hormone production in response to their levels in the body. For example, the regulation of thyroid hormones involves the hypothalamus releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). When the levels of T3 and T4 are sufficient, they inhibit the release of TRH and TSH, thereby reducing further hormone production.",
    "explanation": "Negative feedback loops help maintain homeostasis by reducing hormone levels when they are too high. In the thyroid hormone example, the increased levels of T3 and T4 signal the hypothalamus and pituitary to decrease hormone production, preventing excessive hormone activity.",

      "Hormones are electrical impulses that travel along neurons.",
      "Hormones are produced locally and affect only nearby cells.",

      "Hormones are only involved in involuntary actions."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Hormones are chemical messengers produced in one part of an organism and move to another part to achieve the desired effect.",
    "explanation": "Hormones are indeed chemical messengers that are synthesized in endocrine glands and transported via the bloodstream to target organs or tissues to regulate various physiological processes. Option A describes nervous impulses, Option B is incorrect as hormones can have distant effects, and Option D is incorrect because hormones are involved in both voluntary and involuntary actions.",
