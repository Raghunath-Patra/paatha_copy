    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": [
      "a) Passive and active movement",
      "b) Movement dependent on growth and movement independent of growth",
      "c) Internal and external movement",
      "d) Horizontal and vertical movement"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Movement dependent on growth and movement independent of growth",
    "explanation": "Plants exhibit two types of movement – one dependent on growth, such as the directional growth of roots and shoots, and the other independent of growth, such as the immediate folding of Mimosa leaves. Option b accurately reflects this classification. The other options do not align with the descriptions provided in the content.",

    "question_text": "How do plants like the sensitive plant (Mimosa) achieve movement without the use of muscles or a nervous system?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Plants like the sensitive plant achieve movement by changing the shape of their cells through the regulation of water content, resulting in swelling or shrinking without the need for muscles or a nervous system.",
    "explanation": "The sensitive plant moves its leaves by altering the amount of water in its cells, causing them to swell or shrink. This change in cell shape facilitates movement without relying on muscles or nervous tissue, as described in the content.",

    "question_text": "Which plant hormone is primarily responsible for the elongation of cells on the shaded side of the shoot, resulting in phototropic bending towards light?",
    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": [
      "a) Cytokinin",
      "b) Gibberellin",
      "c) Auxin",
      "d) Abscisic acid"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Auxin",
    "explanation": "Auxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and diffuses to the shaded side of the shoot when light is unevenly distributed. This results in longer cell growth on the shady side, causing the plant to bend towards the light. Cytokinin promotes cell division, gibberellin promotes stem growth, and abscisic acid inhibits growth.",

    "question_text": "What is geotropism and how does it manifest in plant growth?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Geotropism is the growth response of a plant to gravity. It manifests as roots growing downward (positive geotropism) and shoots growing upward, away from the earth (negative geotropism).",
    "explanation": "Geotropism involves plants sensing the direction of gravity and adjusting their growth accordingly. Roots exhibit positive geotropism by growing towards the gravitational pull, ensuring stability and nutrient acquisition, while shoots display negative geotropism by growing away from the earth to access light.",

  {
    "question_text": "What would 'hydrotropism' and 'chemotropism' refer to in plant growth, and provide an example of each.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hydrotropism refers to the directional growth of plant roots toward higher moisture concentrations, allowing the plant to access water. An example is roots growing towards a water source. Chemotropism refers to the directional growth of plant structures in response to chemical stimuli. An example is the growth of pollen tubes towards the ovules during fertilization.",
    "explanation": "'Hydro' means water, so hydrotropism involves roots sensing and growing towards areas with more water to ensure adequate hydration. 'Chemo' refers to chemicals, and chemotropism involves growth responses to chemical signals, such as pollen tubes navigating towards ovules guided by chemical gradients to achieve successful fertilization.",

    "question_text": "During Activity 6.2, after turning the flask so that shoots are away from light and roots towards light, which of the following observations would you expect after a few days?",
    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": [
      "a) Old parts of the shoot and root change direction.",
      "b) Differences in the direction of new growth.",
      "c) No observable changes in growth direction.",
      "d) Both a and b."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Differences in the direction of new growth.",
    "explanation": "After altering the light direction, the existing parts of the plant (old shoots and roots) do not change their orientation. However, new growth will adapt to the new light direction, showing differences in growth direction. Therefore, option b is correct. Option a is incorrect because old parts do not change direction, and option c is incorrect because changes in new growth are expected.",

    "question_text": "Explain why electrical impulses are limited in their use for fast responses in multicellular organisms.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electrical impulses are limited because they only affect cells connected by nervous tissue and the cells require time to reset after transmitting an impulse, preventing continuous or widespread rapid communication.",
    "explanation": "Electrical impulses rely on nervous connections and once an impulse is sent, the cell needs time to reset before it can send another. This limits the ability to continuously or rapidly communicate across all cells in the body. As a result, multicellular organisms often use chemical communication, such as hormones, for more widespread and sustained coordination.",

      "b) Cytokinin",
      "c) Gibberellin",
      "d) Abscisic acid"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Abscisic acid",
    "explanation": "Abscisic acid inhibits growth and is involved in processes like leaf wilting. Auxin promotes cell elongation, cytokinins promote cell division, and gibberellins are involved in stem growth.",

    "question_text": "Differentiate between growth-dependent and growth-independent movements in plants with examples.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Growth-dependent movements in plants are those that result from differential growth rates in different parts, such as tendrils curling around a support or roots growing downward due to geotropism. An example is the tendril of a pea plant wrapping around a fence. Growth-independent movements are quick responses not involving growth, such as the rapid folding of leaves in the sensitive plant (Mimosa) when touched.",
    "explanation": "Growth-dependent movements involve changes in growth rates leading to directional movement. For instance, tendrils grow more on one side to coil around objects. Growth-independent movements occur rapidly through mechanisms like cell shape changes, enabling immediate responses to stimuli without relying on growth, as seen in the Mimosa plant's leaf folding.",
