    ],
    "correct_answer": "d. AgNO₃ solution and copper metal",
    "explanation": "In displacement reactions, a more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its compound. According to the reactivity series, copper (Cu) is more reactive than silver (Ag). When copper metal is placed in a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO₃), copper displaces silver ions (Ag⁺) to form copper nitrate (Cu(NO₃)₂) and releases silver metal.\n\nReactions for other options:\n\na. **NaCl and Cu:** Sodium (Na) is more reactive than copper, but here copper is the metal being introduced into the solution. Since copper is less reactive compared to sodium, it cannot displace sodium from NaCl.\n\nb. **MgCl₂ and Al:** Magnesium (Mg) is more reactive than aluminum (Al). Introducing aluminum into MgCl₂ solution cannot displace magnesium.\n\nc. **FeSO₄ and Ag:** Iron (Fe) is more reactive than silver (Ag), but introducing silver metal into FeSO₄ solution does not result in displacement because silver is less reactive."

Use the hammer to tap the sample if necessary to ensure good contact.\n   - **Procedure:** Place one wire of the circuit on the sample and the other wire to a known metal (like a nail). Close the switch to complete the circuit.\n   - **Observation:** If the bulb lights up, the sample conducts electricity well, indicating it is a metal. If the bulb does not light or lights dimly, the sample is likely a non-metal.\n\n2. **Physical Test (Malleability):**\n   - **Procedure:** Use the hammer to gently tap the sample.\n   - **Observation:** Metals are generally malleable and will deform or flatten when hammered. Non-metals are brittle and may shatter or break upon hammering.",
      "b": "The tests are quite effective but have limitations:\n\n- **Conductivity Test:** Metals typically conduct electricity well due to free-moving electrons, making this a reliable test. However, some non-metals in the form of graphite (a form of carbon) also conduct electricity, which can lead to false positives.\n\n- **Physical Test (Malleability):** Most metals are malleable, while non-metals are brittle, providing a clear distinction. However, some metals like mercury are liquid at room temperature and wouldn't respond to hammering, potentially complicating the test.\n\nOverall, while these tests are useful for distinguishing between most metals and non-metals, exceptions exist, and additional tests may be necessary for ambiguous cases.",

    },
    "explanation": "When sulphur burns in air, it forms sulfur dioxide (SO₂), a gas that is acidic. However, the typical behavior of SO₂ with litmus paper is as follows:\n\n- **Dry Litmus Paper:** SO₂ does not affect dry litmus paper significantly because it needs to dissolve in moisture to exhibit its acidic properties.\n\n- **Moist Litmus Paper:** SO₂ dissolves in water vapor on moist litmus paper to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which is acidic. Therefore, it turns blue litmus paper red.\n\nHowever, based on the options and typical classroom experiments, if the observation contradicts, it's essential to align with standard educational content. Assuming the sulphur produces SO₂, it should turn red litmus blue if considering basic gases, but SO₂ is acidic. Hence, verification is needed.",

    "correct_answer": "**Metals vs. Non-Metals: Chemical Properties**\n\n1. **Reactivity with Oxygen:**\n   - **Metals:** React with oxygen to form basic oxides. Example: Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide (MgO).\n   - **Non-Metals:** React with oxygen to form acidic oxides. Example: Sulfur + Oxygen → Sulfur dioxide (SO₂).\n\n2. **Reactivity with Water:**\n   - **Metals:** More reactive metals (like Na, K) react vigorously with water to form hydroxides and hydrogen gas. Less reactive metals (like Fe, Zn) may react slowly or not at all.\n   - **Non-Metals:** Generally do not react with water.\n\n3. **Reactivity with Acids:**\n   - **Metals:** Reactive metals displace hydrogen from acids, forming salts and hydrogen gas. Metals below hydrogen in the reactivity series do not react.\n   - **Non-Metals:** Do not displace hydrogen; may form acids when reacting with water.\n\n4. **Nature of Oxides:**\n   - **Metals:** Form ionic, basic oxides that react with water to form hydroxides.\n   - **Non-Metals:** Form covalent, acidic oxides that react with water to form acids.\n\n5. **Ability to Displace Other Metals:**\n   - **Metals:** Can displace less reactive metals from their compounds.\n   - **Non-Metals:** Cannot displace metals; instead, they tend to gain electrons to form negative ions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "The man likely used a **chemical solution that plated gold onto a substrate while removing some of the gold from the bangles**, such as an acid or a corrosive agent. One plausible solution is **ammonia-based solutions** or a mixture containing **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**.\n\nHowever, considering the weight reduction, he might have used a solution of a more reactive metal salt (like **silver nitrate (AgNO₃)**) to perform a substitution reaction. Alternatively, he could have used a **chemist's solution containing a strong acid** that partially dissolves gold, but gold is highly resistant. A more likely scenario is he **washed off a gold-plated layer**, thus reducing the weight but making it look shiny again.\n\nGiven that gold does not react with most acids except aqua regia, another possibility is that he **used a chemical to remove tarnish or contaminants**, but this would not typically reduce weight. The drastic weight loss suggests he partially dissolved the gold or removed a substantial layer of it using a specialized chemical, possibly replicating a **spontaneous deposition** or using a **non-standard chemical process**.",
    "explanation": "Gold is a noble metal and does not react easily with most chemicals. The significant reduction in weight implies that the man removed a substantial portion of gold from the bangles. One possible method is using **aqua regia** (a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid) which can dissolve gold.
