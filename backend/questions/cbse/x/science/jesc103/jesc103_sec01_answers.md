    "correct_answer": "Mercury (Hg) is a metal that is liquid at room temperature.",
    "explanation": "Mercury is the only metal that exists in liquid form at room temperature (25°C). This unique property distinguishes it from other metals, which are typically solid under standard conditions. Mercury's low melting point of -38.83°C allows it to remain liquid in everyday environments.",

    "correct_answer": "Sodium (Na) is a metal that can be easily cut with a knife.",
    "explanation": "Sodium is an alkali metal known for its softness. Due to its low hardness, sodium can be easily cut with a knife, unlike harder metals such as iron or copper. This property is characteristic of alkali metals, which have weak metallic bonds that make them malleable and soft.",

    "correct_answer": "Silver (Ag) is the best conductor of heat among all metals.",
    "explanation": "Silver has the highest thermal conductivity of all metals, making it the best conductor of heat. This property allows heat to be transferred rapidly through silver, which is why it is often used in high-performance heat exchangers and conductors.",

    "correct_answer": "Lead (Pb) is a metal that is a poor conductor of heat.",
    "explanation": "Lead has low thermal conductivity compared to other metals like silver or copper. This makes it a poor conductor of heat. Lead's poor heat conduction property is why it is used in applications where heat insulation is required, such as in radiation shielding.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Malleable refers to the ability of a metal to be shaped or deformed under compressive stress, such as hammering or rolling, without breaking. Ductile refers to the ability of a metal to be drawn into thin wires without breaking.",
    "explanation": "Malleability and ductility are two important physical properties of metals that describe their ability to undergo deformation without breaking. 

- **Malleable**: This property allows a metal to be hammered or rolled into thin sheets. For example, gold and silver are highly malleable metals, enabling them to be formed into intricate shapes and structures. Malleability is useful in applications like metal roofing and jewelry making.

- **Ductile**: This property allows a metal to be stretched into a wire. Metals like copper and aluminum are highly ductile, making them ideal for electrical wiring and cables. The ductility of a metal ensures that it can be molded into various shapes necessary for different industrial applications.

Both malleability and ductility are essential for manufacturing processes, allowing metals to be easily shaped according to specific requirements without fracturing.",
