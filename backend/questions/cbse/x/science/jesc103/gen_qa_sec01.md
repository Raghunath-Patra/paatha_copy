    "options": ["Gold", "Iron", "Lead", "Magnesium"],
    "correct_answer": "Gold",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Metals like aluminium and copper are used to make cooking vessels due to their excellent thermal conductivity and malleability. High thermal conductivity ensures even heat distribution, preventing hotspots during cooking. Additionally, their malleability allows the metals to be shaped into various forms required for different types of cookware.",
    "explanation": "Aluminium and copper are favored in cookware because they efficiently conduct heat, ensuring food is heated uniformly. Their malleable nature allows manufacturers to create pots and pans in various shapes and sizes, enhancing their functionality and usability in the kitchen.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Gold is highly malleable and ductile, allowing it to be easily shaped into thin sheets (gold leaf) or drawn into fine wires. This makes gold ideal for uses in jewelry, electronics, and decorative applications. In contrast, lead is relatively less malleable and ductile, making it suitable for applications like batteries and radiation shielding where extreme shaping is not required.",
    "explanation": "Gold's superior malleability and ductility enable it to be used in intricate designs and electronic components where flexibility is essential. Lead's limited malleability and ductility restrict its use to applications where form flexibility is less critical, such as in battery production and protective barriers against radiation.",

    "question_text": "Why are non-metals generally poor conductors of electricity, and how does the behavior of graphite challenge this generalization?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Non-metals typically have poor electrical conductivity because their electrons are not free to move easily through the substance. For example, elements like sulfur and oxygen do not conduct electricity well. However, graphite, an allotrope of carbon, challenges this generalization as it conducts electricity efficiently due to its structure where each carbon atom forms a network of delocalized electrons, allowing free flow of electric current.",
    "explanation": "The general trend is that non-metals lack the free electrons necessary for electrical conduction. However, graphite's unique structure with delocalized electrons forms a conductive network, enabling it to conduct electricity despite being a non-metal. This makes graphite an exception to the typical behavior of non-metals.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When cutting a piece of magnesium with a knife, the metal would show some resistance due to its hardness but still can be cut with effort, indicating it is hard yet relatively malleable. In contrast, sodium metal is very soft and can be cut easily with a knife, often requiring minimal force, and may deform quickly.",
    "explanation": "Magnesium is harder than sodium, so cutting it requires more force and effort, whereas sodium's softness allows it to be cut effortlessly and deformed easily. These observations reflect the differing hardness levels of the two metals.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Copper is a better conductor of heat than lead due to its higher thermal conductivity, which means heat energy is transferred more efficiently through copper's atomic structure. The metallic bonding in copper allows electrons to move freely, facilitating rapid heat transfer. Lead, on the other hand, has lower thermal conductivity because its electrons are less mobile, resulting in slower heat transfer.",
    "explanation": "Thermal conductivity depends on how easily heat can be transferred through a material. Copper's free-moving electrons enable swift heat transfer, making it an excellent conductor. Lead's atomic structure restricts electron movement, reducing its ability to conduct heat effectively.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Alkali metals have high melting points.",
    "explanation": "The incorrect statement is that alkali metals have high melting points. In reality, alkali metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium have relatively low melting points compared to other metals. The other statements are correct: most metals are solid at room temperature (except mercury), graphite conducts electricity, and iodine is a lustrous non-metal.",

    "correct_answer": "School bells are made of metals because metals are sonorous, meaning they produce a clear, ringing sound when struck against a hard surface. This property allows the bells to emit loud and distinct sounds that can be easily heard in a school environment.",
    "explanation": "Sonorous materials like metals generate audible sounds when struck, making them ideal for use in bells. The clear and resonant sound produced by metals ensures that the bell's signal is effectively heard across different areas of a school.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "While physical properties such as lustre, hardness, malleability, ductility, and conductivity generally help classify elements as metals or non-metals, there are several exceptions. For instance, mercury is a metal that is liquid at room temperature, whereas gallium and caesium are metals with low melting points and can melt by hand. Carbon is a non-metal but can exist in graphite, which conducts electricity, and diamond, which is extremely hard. Iodine is a non-metal but exhibits lustre, a property typical of metals. Additionally, some elements like silicon have properties intermediate between metals and non-metals. These exceptions show that classification based solely on physical properties is not always reliable, and chemical properties must also be considered.",
    "explanation": "The presence of elements that do not fit the typical physical property profiles of metals or non-metals highlights the limitations of using physical characteristics alone for classification. Chemical properties, such as reactivity and bonding behavior, provide a more accurate basis for classification.",
