    "correct_answer": "1. **Mineral**: An element or compound that occurs naturally in the earthâ€™s crust.\n\n2. **Ore**: A mineral that contains a high percentage of a particular metal, allowing it to be profitably extracted.\n\n3. **Gangue**: The impurities present in the mined ore, such as soil and sand, which must be removed before metal extraction.",
    "explanation": "The definitions are based on the provided content. A **mineral** is any naturally occurring element or compound in the earth's crust. An **ore** is a type of mineral with a high metal content that makes extraction economically viable. **Gangue** refers to the non-valuable impurities that accompany the ore and need to be separated during the beneficiation process.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Reduction.",
    "explanation": "The process of obtaining a metal from its oxide involves reducing the metal oxide to its elemental form. This is typically achieved by using reducing agents such as carbon or through electrolysis, depending on the metal's position in the reactivity series.",
