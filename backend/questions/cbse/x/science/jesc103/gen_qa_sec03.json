    "explanation": "A neutral sodium atom has 11 electrons with the configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s¹. When it loses one electron to form Na⁺, it loses the 3s¹ electron, resulting in 10 electrons with the configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁶, which matches the noble gas neon.",

    "explanation": "Magnesium loses two electrons to form Mg²⁺: Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻. Each chlorine atom gains one electron to form Cl⁻: Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻. Since there are two chlorine atoms, the complete process is Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻ and 2Cl + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points because a considerable amount of energy is required to break the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state and when dissolved in water.",
    "explanation": "In the solid state, ions are fixed in a lattice and cannot move, so ionic compounds do not conduct electricity. However, when molten or dissolved in water, ions are free to move, allowing the compound to conduct electricity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sodium chloride (NaCl) does not exist as discrete molecules because it forms an extended lattice structure of ions. In NaCl, each Na⁺ ion is surrounded by six Cl⁻ ions and each Cl⁻ ion is surrounded by six Na⁺ ions, creating a three-dimensional network. This ionic lattice is held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions, rather than existing as separate molecules.",
    "explanation": "In ionic compounds like NaCl, the electrostatic attraction between Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions leads to the formation of an extended lattice structure rather than discrete molecules. This structure maximizes the attraction between ions and minimizes repulsion, resulting in a solid crystalline lattice where each ion is surrounded by ions of opposite charge.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ionic compounds are generally soluble in water but insoluble in non-polar solvents like kerosene. Water, being a polar solvent, can stabilize the ions through hydration, allowing the ionic compound to dissolve. In contrast, non-polar solvents cannot stabilize the ions effectively, resulting in insolubility.",
    "explanation": "The polarity of water molecules allows them to surround and stabilize the positive and negative ions of ionic compounds, facilitating dissolution. Non-polar solvents lack the ability to interact with and stabilize these ions, making ionic compounds insoluble in such solvents.",
