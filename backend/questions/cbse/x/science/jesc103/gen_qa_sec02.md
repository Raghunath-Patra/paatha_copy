    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂",
    "explanation": "Sodium reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The equation is balanced by ensuring that the number of atoms for each element is equal on both sides.",

    "question_text": "Explain why copper does not react with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce hydrogen gas.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Copper does not react with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce hydrogen gas because it is less reactive than hydrogen in the reactivity series. The standard reduction potential of copper is higher than hydrogen, meaning copper cannot displace hydrogen from the acid, preventing the evolution of hydrogen gas.",
    "explanation": "The reaction Cu + 2HCl → CuCl₂ + H₂ does not proceed because copper is below hydrogen in the reactivity series. Only metals above hydrogen can displace hydrogen from acids.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Potassium and sodium are stored in kerosene oil to prevent them from reacting with oxygen and moisture in the air, as they react vigorously and can catch fire when exposed to air.",
    "explanation": "Kerosene oil acts as a barrier, protecting these highly reactive metals from atmospheric oxygen and water, preventing accidental fires and oxidation.",

    "question_text": "What is aqua regia, and why is it capable of dissolving gold?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Aqua regia is a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in a 3:1 ratio. It can dissolve gold because the nitric acid acts as an oxidizing agent, forming gold ions, while the hydrochloric acid provides chloride ions to form chloroauric acid (HAuCl₄), effectively dissolving gold.",
    "explanation": "Neither HCl nor HNO₃ alone can dissolve gold. In aqua regia, the combined action of HNO₃ oxidizing gold and HCl forming complexes with gold ions allows the dissolution of gold.",

      "Copper",
      "Lead"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Aluminium",
    "explanation": "Aluminium forms a thin oxide layer (Al₂O₃) when exposed to air, which protects the underlying metal from further oxidation and corrosion. Iron forms rust, which does not protect it, copper forms a black oxide but does not prevent further oxidation effectively, and lead does not form a protective oxide layer.",
