It is represented with one dot.\n- **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in Group 16 and has six valence electrons.

    "correct_answer": "The formation of sodium oxide (Na₂O) and magnesium oxide (MgO) involves the transfer of electrons from the metal atoms to the non-metal atoms, resulting in the formation of ionic bonds.\n\n**Formation of Sodium Oxide (Na₂O):**\n\n1. **Electron Transfer:**\n   - Each sodium (Na) atom loses one electron to form Na⁺ ions.\n   - Oxygen (O) atom gains two electrons to form O²⁻ ion.\n\n2. **Balancing Charges:**\n   - To balance the charges, two Na⁺ ions are needed for each O²⁻ ion.\n\n3. **Chemical Equation:**\n   \n   ```
   4 Na → 4 Na⁺ + 4 e⁻

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ionic compounds have high melting points due to the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions that make up the compound. \n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Electrostatic Attraction:**\n   - In ionic compounds, positively charged cations and negatively charged anions are held together in a rigid, orderly lattice structure by strong electrostatic forces known as ionic bonds.\n\n2. **Energy Requirements:**\n   - To change from a solid to a liquid state (melting), significant energy is required to overcome these electrostatic attractions and break the ionic bonds.\n\n3. **Lattice Energy:**\n   - The lattice energy, which is the energy released when ions form the lattice, is typically very high for ionic compounds. This high lattice energy translates to high melting points.\n\n4. **Structural Stability:**\n   - The three-dimensional lattice structure ensures that each ion is surrounded by ions of opposite charge, creating a stable and strong structure that resists melting until sufficient thermal energy is provided.\n\n**Example:**\n- **Sodium Chloride (NaCl):** Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are arranged in a cubic lattice. Breaking this structure requires a large amount of energy, resulting in a high melting point of 1074 K.\n\nIn summary, the high melting points of ionic compounds are a consequence of the strong ionic bonds and the large amount of energy needed to disrupt the orderly lattice structure.",
    "explanation": "Ionic compounds consist of a lattice of cations and anions held together by strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds). These bonds are significantly strong, requiring a large amount of energy to overcome. As a result, ionic compounds typically have high melting and boiling points. The lattice structure is highly stable and rigid, making it difficult for the ions to move freely without substantial heating, which further contributes to the high melting points observed in ionic substances.",
