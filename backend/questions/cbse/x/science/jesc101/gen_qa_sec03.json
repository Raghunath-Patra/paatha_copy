    "question_text": "In a displacement reaction, iron (Fe) reacts with copper sulphate (CuSO₄) as follows: \n\nFe(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → FeSO₄(aq) + Cu(s).\n\nWhich of the following observations supports that iron has displaced copper from the copper sulphate solution?",
    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": [
      "A) The solution remains intensely blue and the iron nail remains the same.",
      "B) The blue color of the solution fades and the iron nail turns brownish.",
      "C) The solution becomes green and the iron nail turns black.",
      "D) A gas is evolved and the solution becomes colorless."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B) The blue color of the solution fades and the iron nail turns brownish.",
    "explanation": "When iron displaces copper from copper sulphate, Fe is oxidized to Fe₂⁴, causing the blue color of CuSO₄ to fade as Cu²⁴ ions are removed from the solution. Simultaneously, copper is deposited on the iron nail, which may give it a brownish appearance. Option B correctly describes these observations. The other options either describe no reaction or incorrect changes.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "BaSO₄",
    "explanation": "The reaction between sodium sulphate (Na₂SO₄) and barium chloride (BaCl₂) can be represented by the equation: Na₂SO₄(aq) + BaCl₂(aq) → BaSO₄(s) + 2NaCl(aq). Barium sulphate (BaSO₄) is insoluble in water and forms the white precipitate.",

      "A) CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O",

      "D) CuO + C → Cu + CO"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A) CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O",
    "explanation": "Reduction involves the gain of electrons or loss of oxygen. In reaction A, CuO is reduced to Cu by losing oxygen, while hydrogen is oxidized to H₂O. The other options either don't represent the correct reaction or involve different reactants.",

    "correct_answer": "Rancidity is the process by which fats and oils oxidize over time, leading to unpleasant smells and tastes. It can be prevented by adding antioxidants, storing in airtight containers, and protecting the oils from exposure to oxygen, light, and heat.",
    "explanation": "Rancidity happens due to oxidation reactions where fats and oils degrade, producing off-flavors and odors. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals, while airtight containers limit oxygen exposure. Additionally, manufacturing processes like flushing with nitrogen gas reduce oxygen presence.",
