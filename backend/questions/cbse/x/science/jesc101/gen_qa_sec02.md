    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The decomposition of silver chloride into silver and chlorine gas upon exposure to light is fundamental to black and white photography. When silver chloride-coated photographic film is exposed to light, the light energy causes silver chloride to decompose, leaving behind elemental silver. This silver forms the image on the film, with areas exposed to more light becoming darker due to higher concentrations of silver.",
    "explanation": "In black and white photography, silver halides like silver chloride are used in the photographic film. Upon exposure to light, photons provide the energy needed for the decomposition of silver chloride into silver metal and chlorine gas. The silver accumulates in the film, creating a latent image that can be developed into a visible photograph. This process relies on the light-induced decomposition reaction of silver chloride.",
