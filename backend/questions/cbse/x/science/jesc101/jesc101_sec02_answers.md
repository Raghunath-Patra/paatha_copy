    "correct_answer": "1. The substance ‘X’ is **calcium hydroxide**, and its chemical formula is **Ca(OH)₂**.\n\n2. The reaction of calcium hydroxide with water can be represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(s)} \\rightarrow \\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(aq)} \\]",
    "explanation": "1. **Identification of Substance ‘X’:**\n\nThe substance used for whitewashing is known as **slaked lime**, which is chemically named **calcium hydroxide**. Its formula is **Ca(OH)₂**.\n\n2. **Reaction with Water:**\n\nCalcium hydroxide is slightly soluble in water. When it dissolves, it dissociates into calcium ions and hydroxide ions, forming an aqueous solution:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(s)} \\rightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2\\text{OH}^{-}_{(aq)} \\]\n\nHowever, for simplicity, the dissolution can be represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(s)} \\rightarrow \\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(aq)} \\]\n\nThis indicates that solid calcium hydroxide dissolves in water to form an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide.",

    "question_text": "Why is the amount of gas collected in one of the test tubes in Activity 1.7 double the amount collected in the other? Name this gas.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The amount of gas collected at the cathode is double the amount collected at the anode because the electrolysis of water produces twice as many molecules of hydrogen gas (H₂) as oxygen gas (O₂). The gas collected in the cathode test tube, which has double the volume, is **hydrogen (H₂)**.",
    "explanation": "During the electrolysis of water, the following reaction occurs:\n\n\\[ 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O(l)} \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{(g)} + \\text{O}_2\\text{(g)} \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation, **2 moles of water** produce **2 moles of hydrogen gas** and **1 mole of oxygen gas**. This means that for every mole of oxygen produced, two moles of hydrogen are generated. Since equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules (at the same temperature and pressure), the volume of hydrogen gas collected is **double** that of oxygen gas. Therefore, the test tube collecting the gas at the cathode (hydrogen) has twice the volume compared to the test tube at the anode (oxygen). The gas with the larger volume is **hydrogen (H₂)**.",
