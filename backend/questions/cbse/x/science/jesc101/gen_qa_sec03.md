        "type": "MCQ",
        "difficulty": "Medium",
        "options": [
            "A) The solution remains intensely blue and the iron nail remains the same.",
            "B) The blue color of the solution fades and the iron nail turns brownish.",
            "C) The solution becomes green and the iron nail turns black.",

        ],
        "correct_answer": "B) The blue color of the solution fades and the iron nail turns brownish.",
        "explanation": "When iron displaces copper from copper sulphate, Fe is oxidized to Fe\u2082\u2074, causing the blue color of CuSO\u2084 to fade as Cu\u00b2\u2074 ions are removed from the solution. Simultaneously, copper is deposited on the iron nail, which may give it a brownish appearance. Option B correctly describes these observations. The other options either describe no reaction or incorrect changes.",
