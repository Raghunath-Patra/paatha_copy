    "correct_answer": "Balancing a chemical equation ensures that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both the reactant and product sides, adhering to the law of conservation of mass.",
    "explanation": "Balancing chemical equations is essential because it reflects the law of conservation of mass, indicating that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the number of atoms for each element must be equal on both sides of the equation.",
