    "question_text": "Why does the color of copper sulphate solution change when an iron nail is dipped in it?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When an iron nail is dipped in a copper sulphate solution, a displacement reaction occurs where iron displaces copper from copper sulphate. This reaction forms iron sulphate and deposits copper metal onto the iron nail. The chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fe(s)} + \\text{CuSO}_4\\text{(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{FeSO}_4\\text{(aq)} + \\text{Cu(s)} \\]\n\nAs a result, the concentration of copper sulphate in the solution decreases, leading to the fading of its intense blue color. Simultaneously, copper metal is deposited on the iron nail, which may impart a brownish tint to the nail.",
    "explanation": "When iron (Fe) is more reactive than copper (Cu), it can displace copper from its compound, copper sulphate (CuSO₄). The reaction forms iron sulphate (FeSO₄), which is lighter in color compared to copper sulphate, hence the blue color fades. Additionally, copper metal is deposited on the iron nail, altering its appearance.",

    "correct_answer": "An example of a double displacement reaction is the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride: \\[ \\text{AgNO}_3\\text{(aq)} + \\text{NaCl(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{AgCl(s)} + \\text{NaNO}_3\\text{(aq)} \\]",
    "explanation": "In this reaction, silver ions (Ag⁺) and sodium ions (Na⁺) exchange their accompanying anions (NO₃⁻ and Cl⁻), resulting in the formation of silver chloride (AgCl), which is insoluble and precipitates out of the solution, and sodium nitrate (NaNO₃) remains in the aqueous phase.",
