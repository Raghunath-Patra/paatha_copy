    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Acids conduct electricity in aqueous solution because they dissociate into ions, producing H⁺(aq) and their corresponding anions, which allow the flow of electric current.",
    "explanation": "In aqueous solution, acids dissociate into hydrogen ions and their corresponding anions. These ions are charged particles that can move freely in the solution, enabling the conduction of electric current. The movement of H⁺ ions (or more accurately, H₃O⁺ ions) and anions like Cl⁻ facilitates this process, causing the bulb to glow as observed in Activity 2.8.",

    "correct_answer": "H⁺ and SO₄²⁻",
    "explanation": "Sulfuric acid, H₂SO₄, dissociates in water to produce two hydrogen ions (H⁺) and one sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻). \n\n- **Option 1:** HCl produces H⁺ and Cl⁻, not H₂SO₄.\n- **Option 3:** NaOH produces Na⁺ and OH⁻.\n- **Option 4:** KNO₃ produces K⁺ and NO₃⁻.\n\nTherefore, only Option 2 correctly identifies the ions produced by sulfuric acid.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct electricity because they do not produce ions in solution.",
    "explanation": "In Activity 2.8, when glucose and alcohol solutions are tested, the bulb does not glow, indicating no conduction of electricity. This is because glucose and alcohol do not dissociate into ions in solution; they remain as neutral molecules, so there are no charged particles to carry the electric current.",

    "correct_answer": "The solution does not conduct electricity, indicating it is not acidic.",
    "explanation": "In Activity 2.8, only acidic solutions cause the bulb to glow by conducting electricity through ions. If the bulb does not glow, it implies that the solution lacks free ions capable of conducting electricity, thus it is not acidic.",

    "explanation": "Dry HCl gas does not dissociate into ions and therefore does not exhibit acidic properties. However, when HCl gas is passed over wet litmus paper, water facilitates the formation of H₃O⁺ ions, causing the litmus paper to change color, indicating acidity.\n\n- **Option 1:** Dry litmus paper does not change color because there are no free ions.\n- **Option 3:** Only wet litmus paper changes color.\n- **Option 4:** Litmus paper does change color with wet HCl gas.",

    "correct_answer": "Adding concentrated sulfuric acid to water is highly exothermic because it releases a large amount of heat upon dilution. If not done carefully, the heat can cause the mixture to splash, potentially causing burns and breaking the container due to rapid temperature increases.",
    "explanation": "The dissolution of concentrated acids in water releases significant heat, making the process exothermic. Rapid heat generation can lead to violent reactions, splattering of the acid, and breaking of the glass container due to uneven heating. Therefore, the acid should be added slowly to water with constant stirring to safely dissipate the heat.",
