    "question_text": "You have been provided with three test tubes. One of them contains distilled water, and the other two contain an acidic solution and a basic solution, respectively. If you are given only red litmus paper, how will you identify the contents of each test tube?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Use red litmus paper to test each solution. In the acidic solution, the red litmus paper will remain red. In the basic solution, the red litmus paper will turn blue. In the test tube with distilled water, the red litmus paper will remain red, indicating neutrality.",
    "explanation": "Red litmus paper is used to test for acidity and basicity. When you dip red litmus paper into each solution:\n\n1. **Acidic Solution:** Acids do not change the color of red litmus paper; it remains red.\n2. **Basic Solution:** Bases cause red litmus paper to turn blue.\n3. **Distilled Water:** Being neutral, distilled water does not change the color of red litmus paper; it remains red.\n\nBy observing these color changes, you can identify which test tube contains the acidic solution (red litmus stays red), the basic solution (red litmus turns blue), and the distilled water (red litmus stays red with no pH change).",
