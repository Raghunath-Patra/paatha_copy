    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Curd and sour substances should not be kept in brass and copper vessels because the acidic nature of these foods can react with the metals, leading to the release of harmful metal ions and corrosion of the vessel.",
    "explanation": "Curd and sour substances contain acids, which can react with the metals in brass (an alloy of copper and zinc) and copper vessels. For example, acetic acid in sour substances can react with copper to form copper acetate, a compound that can be harmful if ingested. Additionally, the acidic environment can corrode the metal, degrading the vessel's integrity and potentially contaminating the food with metal ions.",

    "question_text": "Which gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal? Illustrate with an example. How will you test for the presence of this gas?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hydrogen gas (H₂) is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal. For example, when zinc reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid:\nZn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)\nTo test for the presence of hydrogen gas, a burning candle or a lit splint can be brought near the gas. If hydrogen is present, it will combust with a characteristic 'pop' sound.",
    "explanation": "When acids react with more reactive metals like zinc, hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acid are reduced to hydrogen gas (H₂), which is observed as effervescence (bubbling). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between zinc and hydrochloric acid is:\nZn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)\nTo confirm that the gas produced is hydrogen, it can be tested by bringing a burning candle or a lit splint near the gas stream. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable and will combust in the presence of a flame, producing a distinctive 'pop' sound, thereby confirming its presence.",

    "question_text": "Metal compound A reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce effervescence. The gas evolved extinguishes a burning candle. Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction if one of the compounds formed is calcium chloride.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The metal compound A is calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nCa(OH)₂(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl₂(aq) + 2H₂O(l) + H₂(g)",
    "explanation": "Effervescence indicates the release of a gas during the reaction. The fact that the gas extinguishes a burning candle suggests it is hydrogen gas (H₂), which is known to do so. Given that calcium chloride (CaCl₂) is one of the products, the metal compound reacting with hydrochloric acid must be calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂), a base. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between calcium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid is:\nCa(OH)₂(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl₂(aq) + 2H₂O(l) + H₂(g)\nIn this reaction, calcium hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce calcium chloride, water, and hydrogen gas. The stoichiometry of the reaction ensures that the number of atoms for each element is balanced on both sides of the equation.",
