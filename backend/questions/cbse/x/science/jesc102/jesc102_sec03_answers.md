    "question_text": "Why do HCl, HNO₃, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions while solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic character?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "HCl, HNO₃, and similar compounds exhibit acidic characteristics in aqueous solutions because they dissociate completely in water to produce hydrogen ions (H⁺), which are responsible for their acidity. In contrast, compounds like alcohol and glucose do not dissociate to release H⁺ ions in water, and therefore, they do not exhibit acidic properties.",
    "explanation": "Acids like HCl (hydrochloric acid) and HNO₃ (nitric acid) dissociate in water to produce hydrogen ions (H⁺) and their corresponding anions (Cl⁻ and NO₃⁻, respectively). The presence of free hydrogen ions in the solution is what imparts acidic properties, such as the ability to donate protons. The chemical equations are as follows:\n\n\[ \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{Cl⁻} \]\n\[ \text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{NO}_3⁻ \]\n\nOn the other hand, compounds like alcohol (e.g., ethanol, \(\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}\)) and glucose (\(\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6\)) do not dissociate to release H⁺ ions in water. Instead, they remain largely intact as molecules, which means they do not increase the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution and thus do not exhibit acidic behavior.",

    "question_text": "Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An aqueous solution of an acid conducts electricity because it contains free-moving ions, specifically hydrogen ions (H⁺) and the corresponding anions (e.g., Cl⁻ in HCl), which carry electric current through the solution.",
    "explanation": "When acids dissolve in water, they dissociate into ions. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissociates as follows:\n\n\[ \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{Cl⁻} \]\n\nThe presence of these free ions (H⁺ and Cl⁻) in the solution allows them to move freely under the influence of an electric field, thereby facilitating the flow of electric current. This movement of ions is what makes the solution conductive. In contrast, non-electrolytes like glucose and alcohol do not dissociate into ions in solution, resulting in poor electrical conductivity.",

    "question_text": "Why does dry HCl gas not change the color of dry litmus paper?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Dry HCl gas does not change the color of dry litmus paper because acidic character arises from the presence of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in an aqueous solution. In the absence of water, HCl gas does not dissociate into ions, and thus, there are no free H⁺ ions to interact with the litmus dye.",
    "explanation": "The acidic properties of HCl are due to its ability to dissociate in water to produce hydrogen ions (H⁺), which interact with indicators like litmus to cause a color change. The dissociation reaction in water is:\n\n\[ \text{HCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ + \text{Cl}^- \]\n\nIn dry conditions, HCl remains as intact HCl molecules and does not produce free hydrogen ions. Since dry litmus paper detects the presence of H⁺ ions to indicate acidity, the absence of these ions in dry HCl gas means there is no interaction to cause a color change. Therefore, dry HCl gas does not exhibit acidic character in the absence of water.",

    "question_text": "While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be added to water and not water to the acid?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When diluting an acid, adding acid to water is recommended to ensure better heat dissipation and to minimize the risk of the mixture splashing. Adding water to concentrated acid can cause the exothermic reaction to generate excessive heat rapidly, leading to splattering and potential hazards.",
    "explanation": "Diluting concentrated acids is an exothermic process, meaning it releases a significant amount of heat. If water is added to a concentrated acid, the heat generated may cause the water to boil rapidly, leading to the violent reaction where the acid can splash out of the container, causing burns. Conversely, when acid is added slowly to water with constant stirring, the heat is more evenly distributed and absorbed by the larger volume of water, reducing the risk of splashing and ensuring a safer dilution process. This method also prevents localized overheating, which can damage the container or cause other safety hazards.",

    "question_text": "How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) affected when a solution of an acid is diluted?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a solution of an acid is diluted, the concentration of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) decreases because the number of H₃O⁺ ions is spread over a larger volume of solvent.",
    "explanation": "Dilution involves adding more solvent (usually water) to a solution, thereby increasing the total volume while keeping the number of solute particles constant. For an acidic solution, the hydronium ion concentration is given by:\n\n\[ \text{Concentration of } \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ = \frac{\text{Number of } \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ \text{ ions}}{\text{Volume of solution}} \]\n\nWhen the solution is diluted, the volume of the solution increases, which means the same number of H₃O⁺ ions is now distributed in a larger volume. Consequently, the concentration of H₃O⁺ ions decreases. This reduction in hydronium ion concentration results in a decrease in the solution's acidity, as measured by a higher pH value.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When excess base is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide, the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) increases because more base molecules dissociate to release additional OH⁻ ions into the solution.",
    "explanation": "Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissociates in water according to the following equation:\n\n\[ \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + \text{OH}^- \]\n\nWhen additional base (e.g., more NaOH) is added to the solution, it dissociates to produce more OH⁻ ions. This increases the overall concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution. The increase in OH⁻ ion concentration makes the solution more basic (higher pH) and enhances its ability to neutralize acids. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\[ \text{[OH}^{-}\text{]}_{\text{final}} = \text{[OH}^{-}\text{]}_{\text{initial}} + \Delta \text{[OH}^{-}\text{]} \]\n\nWhere \(\Delta \text{[OH}^{-}\text{]}\) represents the additional hydroxide ions from the excess base added.",
