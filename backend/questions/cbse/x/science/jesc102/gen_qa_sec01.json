      "Lemon Juice",
      "Vinegar",
      "Baking Soda Solution",
      "Water"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Baking Soda Solution",
    "explanation": "Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is a base that can neutralize excess stomach acid, thereby alleviating acidity. Lemon juice and vinegar are acidic and would exacerbate the problem, while water does not effectively neutralize the acid.",

    "correct_answer": "Phenolphthalein",
    "explanation": "Phenolphthalein is a synthetic indicator that turns pink in basic solutions. Methyl orange changes color in acidic to slightly basic ranges, while litmus and turmeric are natural indicators with different color changes.",

    "correct_answer": "Acids and bases neutralize each other through a reaction that forms water and a salt. For example, the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O.",
    "explanation": "When an acid reacts with a base, the hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acid combine with the hydroxide ions (OH⁻) from the base to form water (H₂O). The remaining ions combine to form a salt. This neutralization process removes the acidic and basic properties, effectively canceling each other’s effects.",
