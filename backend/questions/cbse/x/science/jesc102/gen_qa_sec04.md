    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The 'p' in pH stands for 'potenz', which means power in German. The pH scale generally ranges from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline).",
    "explanation": "The term 'pH' originates from the German word 'potenz', meaning power, indicating the power of hydrogen ions in a solution. The pH scale measures the acidity or basicity of a solution, with 0 being highly acidic, 7 being neutral, and 14 being highly alkaline.",

    "explanation": "pH is calculated using the formula \( \text{pH} = -\log[H^+] \). For a hydrogen ion concentration of \(1 \times 10^{-4}\) M:

    "correct_answer": "1M HCl",
    "explanation": "1M HCl is a strong acid and has a low pH value, making it the most acidic among the options. 1M NaOH is a strong base with a high pH, tap water is neutral with pH around 7, and Milk of magnesia is a mild base used as an antacid.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is classified as a strong acid because it completely dissociates in aqueous solution, releasing a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺). In contrast, acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid because it only partially dissociates in solution, resulting in a lower concentration of hydrogen ions.",
    "explanation": "The strength of an acid is determined by its ability to dissociate into ions in water. HCl dissociates entirely:
    \[
    \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{Cl}^-
    \]
    This complete dissociation leads to a high concentration of H⁺ ions, making it a strong acid. Acetic acid, however, only partially dissociates:
    \[
    \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-
    \]
    The equilibrium lies to the left, meaning not all acetic acid molecules release H⁺ ions, resulting in fewer H⁺ ions in solution and categorizing it as a weak acid.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "As pH increases, OH⁻ concentration increases.",
    "explanation": "The pH and OH⁻ concentration are inversely related. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) increases, indicating a more alkaline solution. Therefore, option 3 is correct. Option 1 is incorrect because it states the opposite relationship. Option 2 is partially correct but does not fully describe the relationship as option 3 does. Option 4 is incorrect because pH and OH⁻ concentration are related through the water dissociation constant.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The saliva becomes less acidic after a meal, as indicated by the increase in pH from 6.5 to 6.8.",
    "explanation": "pH values below 7 indicate acidity. An increase from 6.5 to 6.8 means that the saliva's hydrogen ion concentration decreases, making the solution less acidic.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Tooth decay occurs when the pH in the mouth falls below 5.5 because the acidic environment leads to the corrosion of tooth enamel, which is composed of calcium hydroxyapatite. This low pH environment is produced by acids generated by bacteria degrading sugars and food particles.",
    "explanation": "The enamel of the teeth is primarily made of calcium hydroxyapatite, which is resistant to dissolution in neutral pH. However, when the pH drops below 5.5, the acidic conditions can dissolve the hydroxyapatite, leading to enamel erosion and tooth decay. Bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugars and produce acids as byproducts, which lower the pH. Maintaining a pH above 5.5 is crucial to prevent this demineralization process.",

    \[
    [H^+] = \frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1 \times 10^{-5}} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \text{ M}

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Acid rain lowers the pH of river water, creating an acidic environment that is harmful to aquatic life. Most aquatic organisms are sensitive to pH changes and can only survive within a narrow pH range. A decrease in pH can lead to the death of fish and other aquatic organisms, disrupting the ecosystem.",
    "explanation": "Acid rain contains higher concentrations of hydrogen ions due to dissolved acids like sulfuric and nitric acids. When this acidic water enters rivers, it lowers the pH of the water. Aquatic organisms, such as fish, have physiological processes that are pH-dependent and cannot tolerate significant deviations from their optimal pH range. Lower pH can lead to harmful conditions like reduced reproductive rates, impaired growth, and increased mortality among aquatic species.",

    "correct_answer": "Antacids like magnesium hydroxide neutralize excess hydrochloric acid in the stomach, thereby reducing acidity and alleviating the pain and irritation associated with indigestion.",
    "explanation": "Indigestion is often caused by the overproduction of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach, leading to excessive acidity that irritates the stomach lining. Magnesium hydroxide acts as a base and reacts with the excess HCl in a neutralization reaction:
    \[
    \text{Mg(OH)}_2 + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{MgCl}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
    \]
    This reaction decreases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in the stomach, thereby raising the pH and reducing acidity. The result is relief from the discomfort and irritation caused by indigestion.",
