    "question_text": "When hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are tested with red litmus and blue litmus papers respectively, what color changes are expected for each indicator?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) will turn blue litmus paper red, indicating its acidic nature. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) will turn red litmus paper blue, indicating its basic nature.",
    "explanation": "Red litmus paper is used to detect bases; it turns blue in the presence of a base like NaOH. Conversely, blue litmus paper detects acids and turns red when exposed to an acid like HCl.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Zn + H₂SO₄ → ZnSO₄ + H₂",
    "explanation": "The correct balanced equation shows that zinc reacts with sulphuric acid to produce zinc sulphate (ZnSO₄) and hydrogen gas (H₂). Option A is correct. Option B incorrectly forms zinc oxide and sulfur dioxide. Option C incorrectly balances zinc. Option D incorrectly produces two molecules of hydrogen gas.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Bubbles form because hydrogen gas (H₂) is being produced and it gets trapped in the soap solution, creating visible bubbles.",
    "explanation": "As zinc reacts with dilute sulphuric acid, hydrogen gas is released. When this gas passes through the soapy solution, the surface tension of the soap film traps the gas, forming bubbles.",

    "correct_answer": "Adding NaOH increases the basicity of the solution again, causing phenolphthalein to turn pink.",
    "explanation": "Phenolphthalein is a pH indicator that is colorless in acidic or neutral solutions and turns pink in basic solutions. When NaOH is added, it increases the concentration of hydroxide ions, raising the pH and reverting phenolphthalein to its pink color.",
