    "question_text": "Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and appliances.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "1. **Earth Wire Connection**: The earth wire, typically with green insulation, is connected to the metallic parts of appliances and the ground. This provides a low-resistance path for electric current in case of a leakage, preventing electric shocks.\n\n2. **Use of Electric Fuses**: Fuses protect electrical circuits by melting and breaking the circuit when the current exceeds a safe level. This prevents damage to appliances and reduces the risk of electrical fires due to overloading or short-circuiting.",
    "explanation": "The two primary safety measures highlighted in domestic electric circuits are the use of earth wires and electric fuses. The earth wire ensures that any stray current is safely directed into the ground, minimizing the risk of electric shocks. Electric fuses act as protective devices that interrupt the flow of excessive current, safeguarding both the electrical infrastructure and connected appliances from potential damage or hazards.",

    "question_text": "An electric oven with a 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric circuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A. What result do you expect? Explain.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When operating a 2 kW electric oven on a 220 V circuit with a current rating of 5 A, the circuit is likely to experience an overcurrent condition, causing the fuse to blow. This is because the oven's current demand exceeds the circuit's rated capacity.",
    "explanation": "To determine whether the electric oven can be operated safely on the given circuit, we first calculate the current drawn by the oven using the power formula:\n\n\[ P = V \times I \]\n\nSolving for \( I \):\n\n\[ I = \frac{P}{V} = \frac{2000\,\text{W}}{220\,\text{V}} \approx 9.09\,\text{A} \]\n\nThe calculated current (≈9.09 A) exceeds the circuit's current rating of 5 A. Operating the oven under these conditions will result in the current surpassing the fuse's threshold, causing the fuse to melt and interrupt the circuit. This protection mechanism prevents potential damage to the electrical system and reduces the risk of electrical hazards.",

    "question_text": "What precaution should be taken to avoid the overloading of domestic electric circuits?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To avoid overloading domestic electric circuits, ensure that the total current drawn by all connected appliances does not exceed the circuit's current rating. This can be achieved by distributing high-power appliances across different circuits, using appliances with appropriate power ratings, and avoiding the simultaneous operation of multiple high-current devices on a single circuit.",
    "explanation": "Overloading occurs when the electrical demand surpasses the circuit's capacity, leading to excessive current that can cause fuses to blow or even result in electrical fires. Precautions to prevent overloading include:\n\n1. **Distribute Appliances Across Multiple Circuits**: High-power appliances like heaters, air conditioners, and ovens should be connected to dedicated circuits to prevent them from drawing excessive current through a single circuit.\n\n2. **Use Appliances Within Their Rated Capacities**: Ensure that appliances do not exceed the power rating of the circuit they are connected to. Check the specifications of both the appliances and the circuits.\n\n3. **Avoid Simultaneous Use of Multiple High-Power Devices**: Refrain from operating several high-current appliances at the same time on the same circuit.\n\n4. **Regular Inspection and Maintenance**: Periodically check the condition of electrical wiring and appliances to identify and rectify any potential issues that could lead to overloading.\n\n5. **Install Additional Circuits if Necessary**: If the electrical demand in the household increases, consider upgrading the electrical system by adding more circuits to handle the load effectively.",
