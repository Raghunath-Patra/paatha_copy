    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The magnetic field lines around a current-carrying straight wire form concentric circles perpendicular to the wire, with the field strength decreasing inversely with the distance from the wire. In contrast, when the straight wire is bent into a circular loop, the magnetic field lines still form concentric circles around each infinitesimal segment of the wire. However, at points away from the loop, these circular field lines of each segment combine to create a more complex pattern. At the center of the circular loop, the magnetic field lines become more uniform and parallel, resembling straight lines. Overall, the magnetic field of a circular loop is more concentrated in the region inside the loop, with field lines emerging from one face of the loop and entering the other, similar to a bar magnet.",
    "explanation": "A straight current-carrying wire produces magnetic field lines that are concentric circles around the wire, with the field strength given by B = μ₀I/(2πr), where r is the distance from the wire. When the wire is bent into a circular loop, each small segment of the wire contributes to the overall magnetic field. At points near the loop, the fields from different segments add vectorially, resulting in a strong, nearly uniform field inside the loop. Far from the loop, the magnetic field resembles that of a dipole, similar to a bar magnet, with lines emerging from one side and entering the other. At the center of the loop, the field lines are straight and parallel, as the contributions from all segments align in the same direction.",

    "correct_answer": "The magnetic field inside the loop points upward, out of the plane.",
    "explanation": "According to Maxwell’s corkscrew rule, if you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current (counterclockwise), your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field inside the loop.

    "correct_answer": "Yes, they are similar. The magnetic field inside a solenoid is uniform and resembles the field inside a bar magnet, with distinct north and south poles. Both have field lines emerging from the north pole and entering the south pole.",
    "explanation": "The magnetic field inside a solenoid consists of parallel, uniform field lines, much like the magnetic field inside a bar magnet. Both systems exhibit a dipole nature with a clear north and south pole. The similarity extends to the field line patterns outside the solenoid and the bar magnet, where field lines emerge from the north pole and enter the south pole, creating a similar overall magnetic field structure.",

    "correct_answer": "Iron filings align along the magnetic field lines because they are tiny magnetic dipoles that respond to the external magnetic field created by the current. This alignment reveals the pattern of the magnetic field around the coil.",
    "explanation": "Iron filings are ferromagnetic and become magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field. The dipoles within the filings align with the external field, making the field lines visible as the pattern formed by the aligned filings.",

At the center, the horizontal components of the magnetic fields from opposite segments cancel out, leaving only the vertical components.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. It is formed by placing a ferromagnetic material, such as soft iron, inside a solenoid. When an electric current passes through the solenoid, it generates a strong, uniform magnetic field inside the coil, magnetizing the iron core and creating an electromagnet.",
    "explanation": "An electromagnet leverages the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying solenoid to magnetize a ferromagnetic core. The iron core amplifies the magnetic field due to its high magnetic permeability, resulting in a strong and controllable magnet. The direction of the magnetic field can be easily changed by reversing the current, and the field can be turned off by stopping the current, making electromagnets versatile for various applications.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "correct_answer": "When the current direction is reversed, the direction of the magnetic field inside the loop also reverses. Consequently, the iron filings pattern will show field lines emerging from the opposite face of the loop, effectively flipping the north and south poles.",
    "explanation": "Reversing the current changes the direction of the magnetic field according to the right-hand rule. This results in the magnetic field lines orientation being inverted.
