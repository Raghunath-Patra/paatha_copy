    "correct_answer": "The earth wire provides a low-resistance path for current leakage to the ground, ensuring that any leakage keeps the appliance's potential equal to the earth, thereby preventing severe electric shocks.",
    "explanation": "The earth wire is connected to the metallic parts of appliances and to a metal plate in the earth. In case of a fault or current leakage, the earth wire directs the excess current safely into the ground, maintaining the appliance at earth potential and preventing electric shocks to users.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The fuse melts due to Joule heating, breaking the circuit to prevent damage from overcurrent.",
    "explanation": "When the current exceeds the fuse's rated value, excessive Joule heating occurs in the fuse's metal wire. This heating causes the metal to melt, thereby breaking the circuit and stopping the flow of excessive current, which protects the appliances and wiring from damage.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Using appliances with lower power ratings",
    "explanation": "Option C is NOT a cause of overloading. Connecting too many appliances (Option A) increases the total current draw, an accidental increase in supply voltage (Option B) can raise the current beyond safe limits, and direct contact between live and neutral wires (Option D) leads to a short circuit, all of which can cause overloading. However, using appliances with lower power ratings typically reduces the current draw, thereby avoiding overloading.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A fuse contains a metal wire that melts when excessive current flows through it due to a short-circuit, thereby breaking the circuit and stopping the flow of current to protect appliances.",
    "explanation": "During a short-circuit, the current increases abruptly. The fuse's metal wire is designed to melt at a specific current threshold caused by Joule heating when excessive current flows through it. Melting the wire breaks the circuit, halting the current flow and protecting the appliances from damage.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In domestic electric circuits:\\n\\n- **Live Wire**: Typically has a red insulation cover. It carries the positive voltage from the power supply to the appliances.\\n- **Neutral Wire**: Usually has a black insulation cover. It completes the electrical circuit by carrying the current back to the power source.\\n- **Earth Wire**: Generally has a green insulation cover. It is connected to the ground and provides a safety path for electrical current in case of a fault, preventing electric shocks by keeping the appliance's potential equal to that of the earth.",
    "explanation": "The live wire is responsible for delivering electrical power to appliances, while the neutral wire completes the circuit by returning the current. The earth wire is a safety feature, ensuring that any stray current due to faults is safely directed into the ground, thereby protecting users from electric shocks. The distinct color coding (red for live, black for neutral, and green for earth) helps in identifying and correctly connecting the wires during installation and maintenance.",
