    "correct_answer": "The magnetic force on a straight conductor is given by F = I L √ó B. In magnitude, F = I L B sin Œ∏, where Œ∏ is the angle between L and B. The force is maximum when sin Œ∏ = 1, i.e., when Œ∏ = 90¬∞, meaning the current is perpendicular to the magnetic field.",
    "explanation": "Starting from the Lorentz force law for a current-carrying conductor, F = I L √ó B. The magnitude is F = I L B sin Œ∏. To maximize F, sin Œ∏ must be maximum, which occurs at Œ∏ = 90¬∞. Therefore, the force is largest when the current flows perpendicular to the magnetic field.",
