    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A compass needle gets deflected near a current-carrying conductor because the electric current generates a magnetic field around the conductor, which interacts with the magnetic field of the compass needle, causing it to align with the resultant magnetic field.",
    "explanation": "When electric current flows through a conductor, it produces a magnetic field around it as described by Ampère's law. The compass needle, which itself is a small magnet, responds to this external magnetic field by aligning itself along the field lines, resulting in deflection from its original position.",

At a point above the conductor, the magnetic field direction is counterclockwise relative to the current direction. \\nIncorrect Options:\\n- 'Clockwise' is the direction below the conductor.\\n- 'Inward towards the conductor' and 'Outward away from the conductor' are incorrect as the magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the conductor.",

    "correct_answer": "Iron filings form concentric circles around a straight, current-carrying conductor. This pattern represents the magnetic field lines generated by the electric current.",

    "correct_answer": "When the direction of electric current in a straight conductor is reversed, the direction of the magnetic field lines around the conductor also reverses.",
    "explanation": "Reversing the current changes the direction in which the right-hand thumb points. Consequently, the direction in which the magnetic field lines wrap around the conductor is opposite to the original direction, effectively reversing the entire magnetic field pattern.",

    "explanation": "Magnetic field lines represent the direction of the magnetic field at every point. If two lines were to intersect, it would mean that the magnetic field has two different directions simultaneously at that point, which is not physically possible.

Point the right thumb of your hand in the direction of the current (upwards).\n2. Curl your fingers around the conductor; they show the direction of the magnetic field lines.\n3. On the left side of the conductor, your curled fingers point outwards from the plane, indicating that the magnetic field is directed towards the observer (out of the plane). Thus, the field lines on the left side are coming out of the plane.",
