    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Atmospheric refraction causes the twinkling of stars by continuously bending the starlight as it passes through layers of the Earth's atmosphere with varying refractive indices. These variations are due to changes in temperature and density, causing the light to fluctuate in its path. Since stars are point sources of light, these small changes result in variations in brightness and apparent position, creating the twinkling effect.",
    "explanation": "The twinkling of stars is caused by atmospheric refraction where starlight undergoes bending due to the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere has layers with different temperatures and densities, leading to a continuously changing refractive index. This causes the light to bend towards and away from the observer's eye, making the star appear to twinkle as its brightness and position fluctuate.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The sky appears blue because molecules and small particles in the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered more effectively than red light, which has a longer wavelength. This scattering, known as Rayleigh scattering, causes the blue component of sunlight to be dispersed in all directions, making the sky appear blue to observers on the ground.",
    "explanation": "Sunlight is composed of various colors with different wavelengths. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules and fine particles. Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red and yellow). However, human eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, resulting in the sky appearing predominantly blue.",

    "explanation": "A rectangular glass slab has parallel refracting surfaces, resulting in the emergent ray being parallel to the incident ray with lateral displacement.

To show that the spectrum could be recombined into white light, he introduced a second prism inverted relative to the first.
