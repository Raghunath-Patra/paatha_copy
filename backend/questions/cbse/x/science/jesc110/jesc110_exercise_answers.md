This allows the eye to focus on objects at various distances. \n\n- **Option (a) presbyopia** refers to the age-related loss of accommodation.\n- **Option (c) near-sightedness** (myopia) is a refractive error where distant objects appear blurry.\n- **Option (d) far-sightedness** (hypermetropia) is a refractive error where close objects appear blurry.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Because the eye's lens cannot increase its power beyond a certain limit, preventing it from focusing images of objects closer than the near point (25 cm) sharply on the retina, resulting in a blurred image.",
    "explanation": "The normal eye has a finite range of accommodation determined by the flexibility of the lens and the strength of the ciliary muscles. When objects are placed closer than the near point, the required focal length becomes shorter than what the eye can achieve, causing the image to form behind the retina and thus appearing blurred.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the human eye, the image distance remains approximately constant on the retina. As the object distance increases, the eye's lens decreases its power to maintain the image on the retina.",
    "explanation": "The eye maintains a fixed image distance since the retina is stationary. To focus on objects farther away, the lens becomes thinner, decreasing its power, allowing parallel rays from distant objects to converge on the retina. Therefore, while the object distance increases, the image distance remains effectively constant due to accommodation.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Stars twinkle because their light passes through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere, causing continuous refraction and fluctuations in the light's path, which makes the stars appear to flicker.",
    "explanation": "Stars are point sources of light due to their immense distances from Earth. As their light traverses the atmosphere, varying temperature and density conditions cause the light to bend unpredictably. This results in changes in the intensity and position of the star's image, making it appear to twinkle.",

    "correct_answer": "Planets do not twinkle because they are closer to Earth and appear as extended sources of light. The multiple light paths average out atmospheric disturbances, resulting in steady light without flickering.",
    "explanation": "Unlike stars, planets are relatively closer and thus occupy a larger angular size in the sky. This means the light from planets comes from multiple points, and atmospheric disturbances affect each point differently. The combined effect averages out the variations, making the planet's light appear steady to the observer.",

    "correct_answer": "Because there is no atmosphere in space to scatter sunlight, the scattering that makes the sky appear blue on Earth does not occur, resulting in a dark sky for an astronaut.",
    "explanation": "The blue color of Earth’s sky is due to Rayleigh scattering, where molecules and small particles in the atmosphere scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths of sunlight more effectively. In space, the absence of an atmosphere means there are no particles to scatter the light, so the sky remains dark.",
