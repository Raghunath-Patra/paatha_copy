    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The cornea is a transparent, dome-shaped membrane that forms the front surface of the eyeball. It plays a critical role in focusing light onto the retina by refracting incoming light rays. Due to its curvature and the difference in refractive index between air and the corneal material, the cornea bends the light, contributing to approximately two-thirds of the eye's total optical power. This refraction is essential for forming a clear image on the retina.",
    "explanation": "The corneaâ€™s primary function is to refract light as it enters the eye. Its curved shape and refractive properties allow it to bend light rays, aiding in the formation of a focused image on the retina. This initial refraction reduces the burden on the eye's lens, allowing for more efficient focusing.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "correct_answer": "The power of the concave lens required is -5 diopters.",
    "explanation": "To correct myopia, a concave lens is used to shift the far point to infinity. Using the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}
\]

Here, \( v = \infty \) (desired far point), and \( u = -20 \) cm (current far point, negative for virtual image).

\[
\frac{1}{f} = 0 - \left( \frac{1}{-20} \right) = \frac{1}{20}

Thus, \( f = -20 \) cm (negative for concave lens).

Power \( P = \frac{1}{f (\text{meters})} = \frac{1}{-0.20} = -5 \) diopters.",

    "correct_answer": "Power of accommodation refers to the eye's ability to change the shape of its lens to adjust the focal length for clear vision of objects at various distances. When focusing on distant objects, the ciliary muscles relax, making the lens thinner and increasing the focal length. When focusing on near objects, the ciliary muscles contract, thickening the lens and decreasing the focal length.",
    "explanation": "Accommodation allows the eye to maintain a clear image on the retina by adjusting the lens shape. Relaxing the ciliary muscles for distant vision results in a flatter lens, while contracting them for near vision makes the lens more curved.",

    "correct_answer": "The near point of the hypermetropic eye is 50 cm.",
    "explanation": "Using the lens formula:

\[
P = \frac{1}{f} \Rightarrow f = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \text{ meters}
\]

The lens helps to bring the near point from 50 cm to 25 cm.

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}
\]

Here, \( v = 25 \) cm (desired near point), \( P = +2 \) D.

\[
\frac{1}{0.5} = \frac{1}{25} - \frac{1}{u} \Rightarrow 2 = 0.04 - \frac{1}{u}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{u} = 0.04 - 2 = -1.96 \Rightarrow u \approx -0.5102 \text{ meters} \approx -51 \text{ cm}

Thus, the original near point is approximately 50 cm.",

This dual functionality allows individuals to see clearly at both far and near distances without the need to switch between different pairs of glasses.",
    "explanation": "Bi-focal lenses are designed with two distinct optical powers to address multiple vision defects.

    "correct_answer": "Presbyopia occurs due to the gradual loss of the eye's ability to accommodate, which typically happens with aging. The physiological changes include weakening of the ciliary muscles and a decrease in the flexibility of the crystalline lens. As a result, the eye cannot adjust the lens curvature sufficiently to focus on near objects, leading to difficulty in seeing objects up close clearly.",
