Draw perpendiculars from A, P, and B to the x-axis, meeting it at R, S, and T respectively. From these constructions, observe the following:\n1. The horizontal distance from A to P is x - x₁ and from P to B is x₂ - x.\n2. The corresponding vertical segments formed by drawing lines parallel to the x-axis from P and B will be in the same ratio.\n3. By the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion, the triangles formed (for example, ∆APR and ∆BPS) are similar.\n4. Thus, we have (x - x₁)/(x₂ - x) = m₁/m₂.\n5. Cross-multiplying gives m₁(x₂ - x) = m₂(x - x₁).\n6. Rearranging results in m₁x₂ + m₂x₁ = x(m₁ + m₂), so x = (m₁x₂ + m₂x₁)/(m₁ + m₂).\n7.
