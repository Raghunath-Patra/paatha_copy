    "explanation": "The girl’s eye-level is 1.2 m, so the vertical difference from her eyes to the balloon is 88.2 − 1.2 = 87 m.\nAt the initial observation (angle = 60°): tan 60° = 87 / d₁. Since tan 60° = √3 ≈ 1.732, we have d₁ = 87 / 1.732 ≈ 50.17 m.\nAt the later observation (angle = 30°): tan 30° = 87 / d₂. With tan 30° = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577, d₂ = 87 / 0.577 ≈ 150.70 m.\nThe distance travelled by the balloon = d₂ − d₁ ≈ 150.70 − 50.17 ≈ 100.53 m.",

    "question_text": "A straight highway leads to the foot of a tower. A man standing at the top of the tower observes a car at an angle of depression of 30°, which is approaching the foot of the tower with a uniform speed. Six seconds later, the angle of depression of the car is found to be 60°. Find the time taken by the car to reach the foot of the tower from this point.",

    "correct_answer": "3 seconds",
    "explanation": "Let the height of the tower be H. At the first position:\n tan 30° = H/d₁  →  d₁ = H / tan 30° = H × √3 (since tan 30° = 1/√3).\nAt the second position (after 6 s):\n tan 60° = H/d₂  →  d₂ = H / tan 60° = H/√3.\nThe distance covered in 6 seconds is d₁ − d₂ = H(√3 − 1/√3) = H((3 − 1)/√3) = 2H/√3.\nSince the car continues at uniform speed, its speed v = (2H/√3) / 6 = H/(3√3).\nThe remaining distance from the second position is d₂ = H/√3. The time to cover this distance is:\n Time = (H/√3) / (H/(3√3)) = 3 seconds.",
