Since there are two hemispheres, their combined volume equals (4/3)πr³, which is the volume of a full sphere. 4.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For a test tube modeled as a cylinder with a hemispherical bottom, the total surface area is not simply the sum of the individual surface areas because the base of the cylinder is in contact with the hemisphere. First, compute the lateral surface area of the cylinder: A_cylinder = 2πrh (excluding the base that connects to the hemisphere). Then compute the surface area of the hemisphere: A_hemisphere = 2πr². If you computed the total as (2πrh + πr² for the base + 2πr²), you would double-count the shared circular region. Therefore, remove the area corresponding to the circular interface (πr²). The correct total surface area becomes: A_total = (2πrh + πr² + 2πr²) − (πr²) = 2πrh + 2πr².",
    "explanation": "The proof involves recognizing that in composite solids, overlapping surfaces are counted twice if simply summing the individual areas.

    "explanation": "Step 1: For each gulab jamun, the shape is a cylinder with two hemispherical ends. The given total length is 5 cm and the diameter is 2.8 cm, so the radius r = 2.8/2 = 1.4 cm.\nStep 2: The two hemispherical ends form a full sphere. The cylindrical part’s height = total length – diameter of the sphere = 5 – 2.8 = 2.2 cm.\nStep 3: Volume of the cylinder = πr²h = (22/7)×(1.4)²×2.2. Here, (1.4)² = 1.96, so the volume is (22/7)×1.96×2.2 ≈ 13.55 cm³.\nStep 4: Volume of the full sphere (from hemispheres) = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)×(22/7)×(1.4)³. Since (1.4)³ ≈ 2.744, this gives volume ≈ (4/3)×(22/7)×2.744 ≈ 11.50 cm³.\nStep 5: Total volume of one gulab jamun = 13.55 + 11.50 = 25.05 cm³.\nStep 6: Amount of syrup per gulab jamun = 30% of 25.05 cm³ ≈ 0.3×25.05 = 7.515 cm³.\nStep 7: For 45 gulab jamuns, total syrup ≈ 45×7.515 = 338.175 cm³, which rounds to approximately 338.2 cm³.\nThus, approximately 338.2 cm³ of syrup is found in the 45 gulab jamuns.",

(4.25)³ ≈ 76.77, so volume ≈ (4/3)×3.14×76.77 ≈ 321.52 cm³.\nStep 2: For the cylindrical neck, the diameter is 2 cm so the radius is 1 cm and the height is 8 cm.

When the solids are joined, the overlapping surface does not subtract any space from the interiors. Therefore, the total volume V_total = V_c + V_hc. For example, if l = 15, b = 7, h = 8, r = 7/2, and H = 15 (as in the provided example), then V_c = 15×7×8 = 840 m³ and V_hc = ½ × (22/7) × (7/2)² × 15 = 288.75 m³, yielding V_total = 840 + 288.75 = 1128.75 m³.",

    "explanation": "Each cube has a volume of 64 cm³ so its side length is 4 cm (since 4³ = 64). When two cubes are joined along one face, they form a cuboid with dimensions 4 cm × 4 cm × 8 cm. Alternatively, one can add the surface areas of the two cubes and subtract the area of the two faces that become internal. The surface area of one cube is 6 × 4² = 96 cm², so two cubes have 192 cm², but the common face (of area 4² = 16 cm²) is counted twice. Thus, the external surface area = 192 − 2×16 = 160 cm².",

    "explanation": "In such composite solids where a cone is mounted on a hemisphere with matching bases, the combined total surface area is the sum of the curved surface area (CSA) of the cone and the CSA of the hemisphere (the common circular base is not exposed). \n• The hemisphere of radius r = 3.5 cm has CSA = 2πr² = 2×(22/7)×(3.5)² = 2×(22/7)×12.25 = 77 cm². \n• The total height is 15.5 cm, so the height of the cone is 15.5 − 3.5 = 12 cm.

Hence, the maximum diameter of the hemisphere is equal to the side of the cube, that is 7 cm (radius 3.5 cm). \nThe surface area of the composite solid is calculated by: \n• Cube’s total surface area = 6×7² = 294 cm², but since the top face (area 49 cm²) is in contact with the hemisphere, it is not exposed. Thus, cube’s exposed area = 294 − 49 = 245 cm². \n• The curved surface area (CSA) of the hemisphere = 2πr² = 2×(22/7)×(3.5)² = 77 cm². \nTherefore, total surface area = 245 + 77 = 322 cm².",
