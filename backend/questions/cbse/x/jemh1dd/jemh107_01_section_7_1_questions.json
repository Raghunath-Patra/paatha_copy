    "correct_answer": "Coordinate geometry provides a way to represent lines and parabolas using algebraic equations. For a line, the equation ax + by + c = 0 encapsulates all the points lying on it. For instance, by changing the value of constants a, b, and c, one can shift or rotate the line. Similarly, a quadratic equation in the form y = ax² + bx + c represents a parabola. By converting this quadratic equation into its vertex form, one can easily analyze its vertex, axis of symmetry, and direction of opening. These representations enable further study into intersection points, slopes, distances, and symmetry.",
    "explanation": "In coordinate geometry, the convenience of algebraic representation allows one to use formulas and algebraic manipulations to derive properties such as the slope of a line or the vertex of a parabola. For example, the distance formula aids in calculating segments on a line, while completing the square for quadratic equations reveals the vertex form of a parabola, thereby facilitating the study of its geometric behavior.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Starting with y = ax² + bx + c, first factor a from the quadratic and linear terms: y = a(x² + (b/a)x) + c. Next, complete the square by adding and subtracting (b/2a)² inside the bracket: y = a[(x² + (b/a)x + (b/2a)²) - (b/2a)²] + c. This becomes y = a(x + b/2a)² - a(b/2a)² + c, which simplifies to y = a(x + b/2a)² + (c - b²/4a). This is the vertex form, clearly indicating that the graph is a parabola with vertex at (-b/2a, c - b²/4a), axis of symmetry x = -b/2a, and opening upwards if a > 0 or downwards if a < 0.",
    "explanation": "The process of completing the square transforms the quadratic equation into the vertex form, exposing its geometric properties.

The first closed figure (A to L and back to A) outlines the main body, with additional triangles providing details that may resemble eyes, mouth, or decorative elements. The lines extended from S and U towards the edges of the graph (points on the y and x axes) further augment the figure, integrating both symmetry and asymmetry. The precise interpretation may depend on the viewer's perspective, but the composite gives a recognizable picture with multiple geometric components.",
