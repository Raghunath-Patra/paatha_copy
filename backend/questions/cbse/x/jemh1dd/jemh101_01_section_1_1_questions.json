    "correct_answer": "Assume √2 is rational, so it can be written as p/q in lowest terms where p and q are co-prime. Squaring both sides gives 2 = p²/q², which implies that p² = 2q². Therefore, p² is even, so p must be even. Let p = 2k. Then, substituting back, we get (2k)² = 2q², which simplifies to 4k² = 2q², and further to q² = 2k². This shows q² is even and so q is even as well. But if both p and q are even, they have a common factor of 2, contradicting the assumption that p/q is in lowest terms. Hence, √2 is irrational.",
    "explanation": "The proof starts by assuming the contrary—that √2 is a rational number expressible as a fraction in lowest terms. Through algebraic manipulation, it is shown that both numerator and denominator must be even, which means they share a factor of 2.
