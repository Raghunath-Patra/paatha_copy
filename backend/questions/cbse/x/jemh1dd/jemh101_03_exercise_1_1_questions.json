    "correct_answer": "(i) 140 = 2² × 5 × 7; (ii) 156 = 2² × 3 × 13; (iii) 3825 = 3² × 5² × 17; (iv) 5005 = 5 × 7 × 11 × 13; (v) 7429 = 17 × 19 × 23.",
    "explanation": "To express a number as a product of its prime factors, we repeatedly divide by the smallest prime until the quotient is 1. For (i) 140, dividing by 2 gives 70, dividing by 2 again gives 35, then dividing 35 by 5 gives 7, which is prime. Similarly, for (ii) 156: 156 ÷ 2 = 78, 78 ÷ 2 = 39, and then 39 = 3 × 13. For (iii) 3825: divide by 5 to get 765; 765 ÷ 3 = 255; 255 ÷ 3 = 85; and 85 = 5 × 17. For (iv) 5005, recognizing that 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 equals 5005 helps factor it immediately. For (v) 7429, dividing by 17 gives 437 and 437 factors as 19 × 23. This exercise tests your understanding of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.",
