    "correct_answer": "The mode for grouped data is derived by assuming that the frequency distribution across the modal class can be linearly approximated. Let the modal class be bounded by l (lower limit) and u (upper limit), with class width h, and frequencies f₁ (modal class), f₀ (previous class), and f₂ (next class). By assuming that the increase in frequency from the previous class to the modal class and the decrease from the modal to the next class follows a linear pattern, one can interpolate to find the value within the modal class that corresponds to the highest frequency. The distance (d) from the lower limit of the modal class to the mode is proportional to the difference (f₁ - f₀) relative to the total incremental change (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂). Thus, d = [(f₁ - f₀) / (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h, and adding this to the lower limit gives the mode. Therefore: Mode = l + [(f₁ - f₀) / (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts with the linear interpolation assumption. By drawing a frequency polygon or imagining the shape of the histogram, the point within the modal class where the peak occurs is proportionate to the difference in frequencies of adjacent classes. This leads to the formula Mode = l + [(f₁ - f₀) / (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h, making it possible to estimate the mode even when data is grouped.",

The modal class is, for example, 40-50 with a frequency of 10, while other classes have lesser frequencies and some extreme high scores raise the mean. This discrepancy indicates a negative skew (tail to the left) where a majority are clustered at the lower end, but a few high values inflate the average. The mode (most frequent score) reflects the common performance level, while the mean is affected by outliers. Hence, when the mode is considerably lower than the mean, it suggests that though most students perform around the mode, exceptional performances are pulling the average up, which should be interpreted carefully in assessment contexts.",
    "explanation": "When analyzing data, if the mode is lower than the mean, it signals the presence of outliers or a skewed distribution. The mode captures the most typical performance, while the mean aggregates all values. The example highlights that policy decisions or interventions might need to address the bulk of performance (mode) rather than the average if the distribution is skewed.

Since the data is assumed to be uniformly distributed within the class, the additional observations required to reach n/2 starting from cf are distributed evenly across the class width h. Hence, the term ((n/2) - cf) indicates how far into the class the median lies and when divided by f (the frequency of the median class) gives the proportion of the class width h that corresponds to this excess.

    "correct_answer": "A histogram with equal interval widths uses class intervals that are all the same size, which makes it straightforward to compare frequencies across classes. In contrast, a histogram with varying interval widths requires adjusting the area (height) to accurately represent the frequency density, ensuring that the area of each bar remains proportional to the frequency, not just the height.",
    "explanation": "Equal interval histograms are simpler to interpret since each bar represents the same range of values, making the direct visual comparison of frequencies easier.

One limitation of this method is that it uses the midpoint to represent all values within a class, which introduces approximation errors especially if the data is not uniformly distributed within the intervals.",

    "correct_answer": "The median is a robust measure of central tendency that is less affected by extreme values or outliers compared to the mean. Advantages include its resistance to skewness and its usefulness for ordinal data. However, the median may not fully utilize all the information available in the data (i.e., the precise values within intervals) and can be less precise in grouped data, where interpolation is used. For example, in a distribution with a few extremely high incomes, the mean would be pulled upwards while the median gives a better sense of the 'typical' income.",
    "explanation": "Advantages of Median:\n- It is less sensitive to extreme values and outliers, making it a better measure for skewed distributions.\n- It represents the middle of the data, providing a clear point of division where 50% of the data values lie below and 50% above.\nDisadvantages of Median:\n- In grouped data, calculating the median often requires interpolation which may not be as precise.\n- It does not take into account all the data values (loss of information from the distribution).\nConclusion: In symmetric distributions, mean and median are similar, but in skewed distributions, the median is preferred.",
