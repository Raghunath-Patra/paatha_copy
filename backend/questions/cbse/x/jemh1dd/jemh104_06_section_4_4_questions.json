When the discriminant b² - 4ac equals zero, the expression under the square root becomes 0, and the formula reduces to x = (-b ± 0)/(2a) = -b/(2a).

If a pole is to be placed such that the difference in distances from these two gates is a given value, we let one distance be x and the other be x plus the given difference. Applying the Pythagorean theorem (since the triangle formed is right-angled) leads to a quadratic equation in x. The existence of real positive roots (verified by a positive discriminant) confirms that the pole can be erected and its distances from the gates are determined by solving this quadratic.",
    "explanation": "Consider a circle of a known diameter with two diametrically opposite fixed points A and B. For any point P on the boundary, ∠APB is 90° (inscribed angle in a semicircle). If the difference between distances |AP - BP| is given, assume BP = x and AP = x + d (or x - d, as appropriate). The Pythagorean theorem in triangle APB gives (x + d)² + x² = (diameter)². Simplifying leads to a quadratic equation in x. A positive discriminant guarantees real values for x, and only positive solutions are accepted since distances cannot be negative.
