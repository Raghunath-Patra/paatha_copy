When the balloon is at position A with a known angle of elevation, record that angle (θ₁). When the balloon moves to position B, record the new angle of elevation (θ₂). If the horizontal distance (d) from the observer to the balloon’s vertical projection on the ground at position B is known, then the altitude (h) at position B can be calculated using h = d × tan(θ₂). If d is not directly given, additional information such as the balloon’s horizontal displacement over time may be used together with both sets of data to solve for d and h simultaneously.",
