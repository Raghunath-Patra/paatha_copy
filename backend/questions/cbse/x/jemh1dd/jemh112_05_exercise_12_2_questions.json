Its volume is V_cone = (1/3)πr²h = (1/3)π(1²)(1) = π/3.\nStep 2: For the hemisphere with radius r = 1 cm, the volume is half the volume of a sphere: V_hemisphere = (1/2) × (4/3)πr³ = (2/3)π(1³) = 2π/3.\nStep 3: The total volume is the sum: V_total = π/3 + 2π/3 = π.\nThus, the volume of the solid is π cm³.",

The diameter of the model is 3 cm and its length is 12 cm. If each cone has a height of 2 cm, find the volume of air contained in the model that Rachel made. (Assume the outer and inner dimensions of the model to be nearly the same.)",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "66 cm³",
    "explanation": "Step 1: The model is composed of a central cylinder and two cones attached at its ends. The total length of the model is 12 cm with each cone contributing 2 cm in height. Hence, the cylinder’s height = 12 – 2×2 = 8 cm.\nStep 2: The radius of the cylinder and cones is half of the diameter = 3/2 = 1.5 cm.\nStep 3: Volume of the cylinder = πr²h = (22/7)×(1.5)²×8. Since (1.5)² = 2.25, the volume becomes (22/7)×2.25×8 = (22/7)×18 = 396/7 cm³.\nStep 4: Volume of one cone = (1/3)πr²h = (1/3)×(22/7)×2.25×2 = (22/7)×(2.25×2/3) = (22/7)×(4.5/3) = (22/7)×1.5 = 33/7 cm³.\nStep 5: Volume of two cones = 2×(33/7) = 66/7 cm³.\nStep 6: Total volume = Volume of cylinder + Volume of two cones = 396/7 + 66/7 = 462/7 = 66 cm³.\nThus, the volume of air contained in the model is 66 cm³.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 338.2 cm³ of syrup",
    "explanation": "Step 1: For each gulab jamun, the shape is a cylinder with two hemispherical ends. The given total length is 5 cm and the diameter is 2.8 cm, so the radius r = 2.8/2 = 1.4 cm.\nStep 2: The two hemispherical ends form a full sphere. The cylindrical part’s height = total length – diameter of the sphere = 5 – 2.8 = 2.2 cm.\nStep 3: Volume of the cylinder = πr²h = (22/7)×(1.4)²×2.2. Here, (1.4)² = 1.96, so the volume is (22/7)×1.96×2.2 ≈ 13.55 cm³.\nStep 4: Volume of the full sphere (from hemispheres) = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)×(22/7)×(1.4)³. Since (1.4)³ ≈ 2.744, this gives volume ≈ (4/3)×(22/7)×2.744 ≈ 11.50 cm³.\nStep 5: Total volume of one gulab jamun = 13.55 + 11.50 = 25.05 cm³.\nStep 6: Amount of syrup per gulab jamun = 30% of 25.05 cm³ ≈ 0.3×25.05 = 7.515 cm³.\nStep 7: For 45 gulab jamuns, total syrup ≈ 45×7.515 = 338.175 cm³, which rounds to approximately 338.2 cm³.\nThus, approximately 338.2 cm³ of syrup is found in the 45 gulab jamuns.",

Since (0.5)³ = 0.125, volume ≈ (4/3)×(22/7)×0.125 = 11/21 ≈ 0.52381 cm³.\nStep 4: Number of lead shots = Displaced volume / Volume of one shot = (52.38 / 0.52381) = 100.\nThus, 100 lead shots were dropped into the vessel.",
