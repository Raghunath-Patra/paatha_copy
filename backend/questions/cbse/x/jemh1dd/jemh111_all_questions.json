    "correct_answer": "Assuming each design is a segment formed from a 60° sector, first find the area of one segment. \nSector area = (60/360) × π × 28² = (1/6) × (22/7) × 784 ≈ 411.43 cm². \nTriangle area (for an equilateral triangle with side 28) = ½ × 28² × sin60°. With sin60° = 1.7/2 = 0.85, triangle area = 0.5 × 784 × 0.85 = 333.2 cm². \nArea of one design (segment) = Sector area − Triangle area ≈ 411.43 − 333.2 = 78.23 cm². \nTotal area for 6 designs = 6 × 78.23 ≈ 469.38 cm². \nCost = 469.38 × 0.35 ≈ ₹164.28.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: The 6 designs come from dividing the circle into 6 equal segments by drawing 6 equally spaced diameters (or chords). Each segment is obtained by subtracting the corresponding triangle from the 60° sector. \nStep 2: Calculate the area of a 60° sector using r = 28 cm and π = 22/7: Sector area = (1/6) × (22/7) × 28² = (1/6) × (22/7) × 784 ≈ 411.43 cm². \nStep 3: The triangle formed in each sector is isosceles with vertex angle 60°; its area = ½ × 28² × sin60°. With sin60° approximated as 0.85 (using √3 = 1.7), the triangle area is 0.5 × 784 × 0.85 = 333.2 cm². \nStep 4: The area of one design (segment) = Sector area − Triangle area = 411.43 − 333.2 = 78.23 cm². \nStep 5: Total area for 6 designs = 6 × 78.23 ≈ 469.38 cm². \nStep 6: Multiply by the cost per cm²: 469.38 × 0.35 ≈ ₹164.28.",
