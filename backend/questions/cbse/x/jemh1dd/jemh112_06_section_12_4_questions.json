    "explanation": "Consider a building with a dome. The dome (hemisphere) fits exactly onto a circular section of the building's roof (cuboid). The base of the dome is in contact with the roof, meaning that its circular area is hidden from view.

For the cone, compute the lateral surface area: CSA_cone = πrl (where l is the slant height of the cone). 4. Since the cone is placed on the cylinder, the common base area (πr²) is not visible. 5.
