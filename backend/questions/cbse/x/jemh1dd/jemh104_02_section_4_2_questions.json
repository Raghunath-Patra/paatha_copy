    "explanation": "First, simplify each option. Option 1 simplifies to x² – 4x + 5 = 2x – 3, which leads to a quadratic equation. Option 3 simplifies to 2x² + 3x = x² + 1, giving x² + 3x – 1 = 0, which is quadratic. Option 4 simplifies to x² + 6x + 9 – 9 = x² + 6x = 0, also quadratic. Option 2 simplifies as follows: LHS = x² + x + 8; RHS = (x+2)(x–2) = x² – 4; equating gives x² + x + 8 = x² – 4 → x + 12 = 0, which is linear. Hence, option 2 does not yield a quadratic equation.",
