    "explanation": "The perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord. Thus, AM = MB = 12/2 = 6 cm. In right triangle OAM, using the Pythagorean theorem:\nOM² = OA² - AM² = 10² - 6² = 100 - 36 = 64.\nHence, OM = √64 = 8 cm.",

    "question_text": "For a circle of radius 8 cm, a chord PQ of length 10 cm is drawn. The tangents at P and Q meet at T. Find the length of the tangent TP.",

    "correct_answer": "TP = (40√39)/39 cm",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Since PQ = 10 cm, the midpoint R of PQ has PR = 5 cm. Also, OP = OQ = 8 cm.\nStep 2: In right triangle OPR, OR = √(OP² - PR²) = √(8² - 5²) = √(64 - 25) = √39.\nStep 3: Draw OT which is the line joining O to T, and note that OT is the sum of OR and TR (where TR is the segment from R to T along the perpendicular line). Let TR = y.\nStep 4: In right triangle PRT (with right angle at R), TP² = y² + 5² = y² + 25.\nStep 5: In right triangle OPT, since OP ⟂ TP, we have OT² = OP² + TP²; however, OT = OR + y = √39 + y.\nThus, (√39 + y)² = 8² + (y² + 25) = 64 + y² + 25 = y² + 89.\nStep 6: Expanding gives 39 + 2y√39 + y² = y² + 89, so 2y√39 = 50, hence y = 25/√39.\nStep 7: Substitute back into TP²: TP² = (25/√39)² + 25 = (625/39) + 25 = (625 + 975)/39 = 1600/39.\nStep 8: Therefore, TP = √(1600/39) = 40/√39 = (40√39)/39 cm.",
