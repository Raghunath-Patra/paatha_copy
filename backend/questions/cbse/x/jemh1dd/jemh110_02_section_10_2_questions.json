    "explanation": "During the activity, when the straight wire AB is rotated about a fixed point P on the circle, it initially intersects the circle at P and another point. As the wire approaches a particular position, the other intersection point 'merges' with P, leaving a single point of intersection.

    "correct_answer": "Proof: Let O be the centre of the circle, P be the point of contact of the tangent XY, and Q any other point on XY. Since Q lies outside the circle, OQ is greater than OP. Therefore, OP is the shortest distance from O to any point on XY, implying OP is perpendicular to XY. This completes the proof.",
    "explanation": "1. Draw a circle with centre O and tangent line XY touching at point P.\n2. Choose any point Q on XY (Q ≠ P) and join it to O.\n3. Since Q is not the point of contact, Q must lie outside the circle, making OQ longer than the radius OP.\n4. By the property of a perpendicular, the shortest distance from a point to a line is along the perpendicular. Hence, OP, being the shortest, must be perpendicular to XY.\n5. This proves that the radius drawn to the tangent at the point of contact is perpendicular to the tangent, establishing that OP is the minimum distance from O to the line.",

    "correct_answer": "A tangent is considered as a limiting case of a secant because, as a secant's two points of intersection with the circle approach each other along the curve, they eventually coincide to form a single point. This single point is where the tangent touches the circle.",
    "explanation": "1. In Activity 1, as the straight wire AB rotates about the contact point P, its other point of intersection (say Q₁) with the circle moves closer to P. In the limiting position, Q₁ coincides with P, giving a single intersection point, which is the tangent.\n2. In Activity 2, by drawing lines parallel to a secant PQ and observing the chord lengths, one sees that the chord length decreases as the line approaches a tangent position until it becomes zero at the point of tangency.\n3. Hence, both activities illustrate that a tangent is essentially a secant where the two points of intersection merge. This limiting process is at the heart of understanding tangency in circle geometry.",
