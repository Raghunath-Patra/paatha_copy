    "correct_answer": "Let the arithmetic progression be: a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + (n-1)d. By observing the pattern, we see that every term increases linearly by d. For the 1st term, n=1: a₁ = a + (1-1)d = a. For the 2nd term, n=2: a₂ = a + d, and for the nth term: aₙ = a + (n-1)d. Thus the formula is proven by pattern recognition and the principle of mathematical induction can be applied to further confirm it.",
    "explanation": "To elaborate, after verifying the base case (n=1) holds true, assume the formula holds for some integer k, i.e., aₖ = a + (k-1)d. Then, the (k+1)th term is aₖ + d = [a + (k-1)d] + d = a + kd. This completes the induction step and hence the formula is valid.",
