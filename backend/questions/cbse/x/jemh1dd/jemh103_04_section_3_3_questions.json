    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When substitution leads to an identity like 18 = 18, it means that after eliminating one variable, the remaining equation does not restrict the solution set because it is always true for any value of the variable. For example, consider the equations: 2x + 3y = 9 and 4x + 6y = 18. Solving the first equation for x gives x = (9 - 3y)/2. Substituting into the second gives: 4[(9 - 3y)/2] + 6y = 18 → 2(9 - 3y) + 6y = 18 → 18 - 6y + 6y = 18, which simplifies to 18 = 18. Since the variable y cancels out, any value of y will satisfy the system, and hence, there are infinitely many solutions.",
