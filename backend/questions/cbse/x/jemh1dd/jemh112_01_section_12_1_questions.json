Calculate the volume of a sphere using V_sphere = (4/3)πr³, then divide by 2 for one hemisphere, so V_hemisphere = (2/3)πr³. 3. Since there are two hemispheres, their combined volume equals (4/3)πr³, which is the volume of a full sphere. 4. Add the volume of the cylinder and the sphere to get the total volume: V_total = πr²h + (4/3)πr³.",
    "explanation": "First, find the volume of each basic shape. The cylinder's volume is straightforward using πr²h. Each hemisphere is half of a sphere, so compute one and multiply by two.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For a test tube modeled as a cylinder with a hemispherical bottom, the total surface area is not simply the sum of the individual surface areas because the base of the cylinder is in contact with the hemisphere. First, compute the lateral surface area of the cylinder: A_cylinder = 2πrh (excluding the base that connects to the hemisphere). Then compute the surface area of the hemisphere: A_hemisphere = 2πr². If you computed the total as (2πrh + πr² for the base + 2πr²), you would double-count the shared circular region. Therefore, remove the area corresponding to the circular interface (πr²). The correct total surface area becomes: A_total = (2πrh + πr² + 2πr²) − (πr²) = 2πrh + 2πr².",
    "explanation": "The proof involves recognizing that in composite solids, overlapping surfaces are counted twice if simply summing the individual areas. The detailed steps show that by calculating separately and then subtracting the shared area, one obtains the correct surface area.
