To solve: Using the quadratic formula, x = [-1 ± √(1 + 2400)] / (2×2) = [-1 ± √2401] / 4 = [-1 ± 49] / 4. We discard the negative solution. Thus, x = (48/4) = 12 m.

If Δ > 0, there are two distinct real roots; if Δ = 0, there is exactly one (a repeated root); and if Δ < 0, there are no real roots (the roots are complex). Thus, the equation cannot have more than two distinct real roots. This is because the quadratic formula, x = (-b ± √(Δ))/(2a), provides only two potential solutions, and the nature of the square root determines their distinction.",
    "explanation": "The discriminant Δ encapsulates the necessary information about the nature of the roots. When Δ is positive, the ± leads to two distinct solutions.

    "correct_answer": "To complete the square for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, first divide by a to obtain x² + (b/a)x = -c/a. Next, add (b/2a)² to each side, yielding x² + (b/a)x + (b/2a)² = (b/2a)² - c/a. This allows the left side to be written as (x + b/2a)², so we have (x + b/2a)² = (b² - 4ac)/(4a²). Taking the square root of both sides, x + b/2a = ±√(b² - 4ac)/(2a), hence x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a). Historically, this method, as detailed in the works of ancient Indian mathematicians and later Sridharacharya, resonates with the progression in solving quadratic equations by a purely algebraic method.",
