    "correct_answer": "The prizes are: ₹160, ₹140, ₹120, ₹100, ₹80, ₹60, and ₹40.",
    "explanation": "Let the first prize be a. Then the prizes form an AP with common difference d = –20 and n = 7. The sum S = 7/2 × [2a + (7–1)(–20)] = 700.\nThis gives 7/2 × (2a – 120) = 700, so 2a – 120 = (700×2)/7 = 200, hence 2a = 320 and a = 160.\nThe prizes are: a = 160, a–20 = 140, a–40 = 120, a–60 = 100, a–80 = 80, a–100 = 60, a–120 = 40.",

The sum of the radii is S = 13/2 × [first term + last term]. The last term is 0.5 + (13–1)×0.5 = 6.5 cm, so S = 13/2 × (0.5 + 6.5) = 13/2 × 7 = 45.5 cm.\nThe total length of the spiral is π × 45.5 = (22/7) × 45.5.

The discriminant is 41² – 4×400 = 1681 – 1600 = 81, so n = (41 ± 9)/2. This gives n = 25 or n = 16. Since 25 rows would imply a top row with 21 – 25 = –4 logs (impossible), n must be 16.

For each potato, the competitor runs to the potato and back, so the distance for the kth potato is 2 × (5 + 3(k – 1)).\nThe total distance = 2 × [sum of distances for k = 1 to 10]. The sum of the distances is S = 10/2 × [first term + last term]. The 10th term is 5 + 3×9 = 32 m.
