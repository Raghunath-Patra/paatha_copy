Also, cos 30° = √3/2 so cos² 30° = 3/4 and sin 60° = √3/2 so sin² 60° = 3/4. Thus, 2 + 3/4 – 3/4 = 2.\nFor (iii): cos 45° = 1/√2. Also, sec 30° = 1/cos 30° = 2/√3 and cosec 30° = 1/sin 30° = 2.

So numerator = 1/2 + 1 – 2/√3 = (3/2 – 2/√3). Denom: sec 30° = 2/√3, cos 60° = 1/2, cot 45° = 1, so denominator = 2/√3 + 1/2 + 1 = (2/√3 + 3/2).

The denominator is sin² 30° + cos² 30°, where sin 30° = 1/2 (so 1/4) and cos 30° = √3/2 (so 3/4); their sum = 1. Therefore, the expression is (5/4 + 16/3 – 1) = (5/4 – 1) + 16/3 = (1/4) + 16/3.
