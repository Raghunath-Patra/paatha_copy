    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Yes, because after the first km the fare increases by a constant amount of ₹8. The total fare for 1 km is ₹15, for 2 km is ₹15 + ₹8 = ₹23, for 3 km is ₹23 + ₹8 = ₹31, and so on, forming an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 8 (after an initial fixed starting amount).",
    "explanation": "An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence where the difference between successive terms is constant. In this situation, although the first term is ₹15 and the first increase is by ₹8, the increase for every additional km remains constant at ₹8. Thus, if we consider the cumulative fare after each km, the sequence 15, 23, 31, ... has a constant difference of 8, which is the defining property of an AP.",

    "correct_answer": "Yes, it is an arithmetic progression with common difference 24. Note that 1² = 1, 5² = 25, 7² = 49, and 73 appears as the fourth term since 25 - 1 = 24, 49 - 25 = 24, and 73 - 49 = 24. The next three terms are 73 + 24 = 97, 97 + 24 = 121, and 121 + 24 = 145.",
    "explanation": "Although the sequence starts with perfect squares for the first three terms, the fourth term (73) maintains the constant difference of 24 between consecutive terms (25-1=24, 49-25=24, 73-49=24). Thus, it is an arithmetic progression with d = 24, and the subsequent terms can be calculated by continually adding 24.",
