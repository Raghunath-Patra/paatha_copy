Write the similarity criterion used by you for answering the question and also write the pairs of similar triangles in the symbolic form. (i) ∆ABC (∠A = 60°, ∠B = 80°, ∠C = 40°), ∆PQR (∠P = 60°, ∠Q = 80°, ∠R = 40°); (ii) ∆ABC (AB = 2, BC = 2.5, AC = 3), ∆PQR (PQ = 6, QR = 4, PR = 5); (iii) ∆LMP (LM = 2.7, MP = 2, LP = 3), ∆DEF (DE = 4, EF = 5, DF = 6); (iv) ∆MNL (MN = 2.5, ML = 5, ∠M = 70°), ∆PQR (PQ = 5, QR = 10, ∠Q = 70°); (v) ∆ABC (AB = 2.5, BC = 3, ∠A = 80°), ∆DEF (DF = 5, EF = 6, ∠F = 80°); (vi) ∆DEF (∠D = 70°, ∠E = 80°, ∠F = 30°), ∆PQR (∠Q = 80°, ∠R = 30°, ∠P = 70°).",

    "correct_answer": "For (i): Since corresponding angles are equal (60°, 80°, 40°), ∆ABC ~ ∆PQR by the AAA similarity criterion. For (ii): Checking ratios gives AB/QR = 2/4 = 1/2, BC/RP = 2.5/5 = 1/2, and AC/PQ = 3/6 = 1/2 so ∆ABC ~ ∆QRP by the SSS similarity criterion. For (iii): The sides are not proportional; hence the triangles are not similar. For (iv): With ∠M = 70° equal to ∠Q = 70° and the sides about that angle being proportional, ∆MNL ~ ∆QPR by the SAS similarity criterion. For (v): Even if two sides are in a given proportion, the equal angle is not included between them; therefore, the triangles are not similar. For (vi): Since the angles in one triangle are a rearrangement of those in the other, by AA (or AAA) criterion, ∆DEF ~ ∆PQR.",
    "explanation": "In part (i), equal corresponding angles directly yield similarity by the AAA criterion. In part (ii), after computing the ratios of corresponding sides (2/4, 2.5/5, 3/6 all equal 1/2), the triangles are similar by SSS criterion; note that the proper correspondence (written as ∆ABC ~ ∆QRP) is essential. In part (iii), the lack of a constant ratio among corresponding sides means the triangles are not similar. In part (iv), having one pair of equal angles with the sides included being in proportion leads to similarity by the SAS criterion. In part (v), the given equal angle is not the included angle between the sides given in proportion, so similarity cannot be confirmed. In part (vi), the equality of all corresponding angles (despite order) confirms similarity via the AA or AAA criterion.",

    "correct_answer": "A correct solution yields: In ∆ODC, let ∠CDO = 70°, ∠DOC = 65° and ∠OCD = 45° (since 70° + 65° + 45° = 180°). By the similarity (with correspondence O→O, D→B, C→A), we have ∠DOC = ∠BOA = 65° and ∠OCD = ∠OAB = 45°. Thus, the answers are: ∠DOC = 65°, ∠DCO (which is ∠OCD) = 45°, and ∠OAB = 45°.",
    "explanation": "Assign letters to the angles in ∆ODC: let ∠CDO = 70° (given), ∠DOC = x and ∠OCD = 180° - 70° - x = 110° - x. By the correspondence provided by the similarity ∆ODC ~ ∆OBA (with O corresponding to O, D to B and C to A), we have ∠DOC = ∠BOA and ∠OCD = ∠OAB. Choosing x = 65° satisfies the triangle angle sum (65° + 70° + 45° = 180°) and leads to ∠OAB = 45°.
