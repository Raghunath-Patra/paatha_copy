    "correct_answer": "For (i): No real roots because discriminant = (-3)² - 4×2×5 = 9 - 40 = -31, which is <0. For (ii): Two equal real roots because discriminant = (−4√3)² - 4×3×4 = 48 - 48 = 0, so the single repeated root is x = (4√3)/(6) = (2√3)/3. For (iii): Two distinct real roots because discriminant = (-6)² - 4×2×3 = 36 - 24 = 12 > 0, and the roots are x = [6 ± √12] / (4) = [6 ± 2√3] / 4 = (3 ± √3) / 2.",
    "explanation": "For each quadratic, we first compute the discriminant Δ = b² - 4ac. (i) For 2x² – 3x + 5 = 0, a = 2, b = -3, c = 5 so Δ = 9 - 40 = -31, which is negative; hence, no real roots. (ii) For 3x² – 4√3 x + 4 = 0, a = 3, b = -4√3, c = 4 so Δ = (4√3)² - 4×3×4 = 48 - 48 = 0; a zero discriminant implies two equal (repeated) roots given by x = -b/(2a) = (4√3)/(6) = (2√3)/3. (iii) For 2x² – 6x + 3 = 0, a = 2, b = -6, c = 3 so Δ = 36 - 24 = 12; a positive discriminant gives two distinct real roots: x = [6 ± √12]/4 = [6 ± 2√3]/4 = (3 ± √3)/2.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For (i): The condition for equal roots is Δ = 0. Here, a = 2, b = k, c = 3, so k² - 4×2×3 = 0, which gives k² = 24 and hence k = ±2√6. For (ii): First, expand kx(x – 2) + 6 = kx² - 2kx + 6 = 0. Here, a = k, b = -2k, c = 6. The discriminant is Δ = (-2k)² - 4×k×6 = 4k² - 24k. Setting Δ = 0 yields 4k(k - 6) = 0. Since k = 0 would degenerate the equation (making it non-quadratic), the valid solution is k = 6.",
    "explanation": "To have two equal roots in a quadratic ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant Δ = b² - 4ac must be zero. (i) For 2x² + kx + 3 = 0, setting k² - 24 = 0 results in k² = 24, so k = 2√6 or k = -2√6. (ii) For the equation written in standard form as kx² - 2kx + 6 = 0, setting the discriminant 4k² - 24k = 0 leads to k( k - 6) = 0 after factoring out 4k. Since k = 0 is not acceptable for a quadratic equation, the only valid solution is k = 6.",

    "correct_answer": "Yes, it is possible. Let the breadth be x metres; then the length is 2x. The area is given by length × breadth = 2x² = 800. Solving, x² = 400, so x = 20. Therefore, the breadth is 20 m and the length is 2×20 = 40 m.",
    "explanation": "Let the breadth = x m and length = 2x m. The area is given by 2x² = 800. Dividing both sides by 2, x² = 400, which implies x = 20 (since dimension must be positive). Hence, the mango grove will have a breadth of 20 m and a length of 40 m.",

    "correct_answer": "Let the present ages be x and (20 - x). Four years ago, their ages were x - 4 and 16 - x. The equation is (x - 4)(16 - x) = 48. Expanding gives -x² + 20x - 64 = 48, or x² - 20x + 112 = 0. The discriminant of this quadratic is (20)² - 4×1×112 = 400 - 448 = -48, which is negative. Therefore, no real solution exists, and the situation is not possible.",
    "explanation": "Let the two present ages be x and 20 - x. Four years ago, their ages become x - 4 and (20 - x - 4) = 16 - x. According to the problem, (x - 4)(16 - x) = 48. Expanding: x(16 - x) - 4(16 - x) = 16x - x² - 64 + 4x = -x² + 20x - 64, equating to 48 leads to -x² + 20x - 112 = 0, or x² - 20x + 112 = 0. The discriminant is 400 - 448 = -48, which is less than 0.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",

    "correct_answer": "Yes, it is possible. Let the length be l and breadth be b. Given the perimeter 2(l + b) = 80, so l + b = 40, and the area l×b = 400. Substituting l = 40 - b into the area equation gives (40 - b)b = 400, which simplifies to b² - 40b + 400 = 0. The discriminant of this quadratic is 40² - 4×1×400 = 1600 - 1600 = 0, hence b = 20 m and l = 20 m.",
    "explanation": "Let l = length and b = breadth. The perimeter condition gives l + b = 40, and the area condition gives lb = 400. Replacing l with (40 - b) in the area equation yields (40 - b)b = 400, or b² - 40b + 400 = 0. The discriminant is 0, indicating a unique solution. Solving b = 40/2 = 20 m, then l = 40 - 20 = 20 m.
