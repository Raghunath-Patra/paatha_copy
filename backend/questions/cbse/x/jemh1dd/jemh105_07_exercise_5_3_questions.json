Thus, n(8n – 4) = 180. Simplifying: 8n² – 4n – 180 = 0 ⇒ 2n² – n – 45 = 0. The discriminant is 361, so n = (1 + 19)/4 = 5. Then aₙ = 2 + 4×8 = 34.\n(vii) Given a = 8, aₙ = 62: 8 + (n–1)d = 62 ⇒ (n–1)d = 54. Also, Sₙ = n/2 × (8 + 62) = 70n/2 = 35n, and 35n = 210 implies n = 6.

    "explanation": "Let the first prize be a. Then the prizes form an AP with common difference d = –20 and n = 7. The sum S = 7/2 × [2a + (7–1)(–20)] = 700.\nThis gives 7/2 × (2a – 120) = 700, so 2a – 120 = (700×2)/7 = 200, hence 2a = 320 and a = 160.\nThe prizes are: a = 160, a–20 = 140, a–40 = 120, a–60 = 100, a–80 = 80, a–100 = 60, a–120 = 40.",

    "explanation": "The length of a semicircular arc = π × radius.\nThe radii form an AP with first term 0.5 cm, common difference 0.5 cm, and number of terms n = 13. The sum of the radii is S = 13/2 × [first term + last term]. The last term is 0.5 + (13–1)×0.5 = 6.5 cm, so S = 13/2 × (0.5 + 6.5) = 13/2 × 7 = 45.5 cm.\nThe total length of the spiral is π × 45.5 = (22/7) × 45.5. Express 45.5 as 91/2, then the length = (22 × 91)/(7 × 2) = 2002/14 = 143 cm.",

The top row has (20 – n + 1) logs.\nThe sum S = n/2 × (first term + last term) = n/2 × [20 + (21 – n)] = n/2 × (41 – n) must equal 200.\nThus, n(41 – n) = 400, which rearranges to n² – 41n + 400 = 0. The discriminant is 41² – 4×400 = 1681 – 1600 = 81, so n = (41 ± 9)/2. This gives n = 25 or n = 16. Since 25 rows would imply a top row with 21 – 25 = –4 logs (impossible), n must be 16.

    "explanation": "The distances to the potatoes from the bucket form an AP with first term 5 m and common difference 3 m. For each potato, the competitor runs to the potato and back, so the distance for the kth potato is 2 × (5 + 3(k – 1)).\nThe total distance = 2 × [sum of distances for k = 1 to 10]. The sum of the distances is S = 10/2 × [first term + last term]. The 10th term is 5 + 3×9 = 32 m. Therefore, S = 5 × (5 + 32) = 5 × 37 = 185 m.\nMultiplying by 2 gives the total distance: 2 × 185 = 370 m.",
