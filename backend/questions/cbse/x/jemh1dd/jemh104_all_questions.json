To complete the square, add (b/2a)² = b²/4a² to both sides, obtaining: x² + (b/a)x + b²/4a² = -c/a + b²/4a². The left-hand side becomes (x + b/2a)² and the right-hand side simplifies to (b² - 4ac)/4a². Taking the square root of both sides gives x + b/2a = ± √(b² - 4ac)/ (2a). Subtracting b/2a from both sides, we get x = [ -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ]/(2a).",

For (ii): First, expand kx(x – 2) + 6 = kx² - 2kx + 6 = 0. Here, a = k, b = -2k, c = 6. The discriminant is Δ = (-2k)² - 4×k×6 = 4k² - 24k. Setting Δ = 0 yields 4k(k - 6) = 0.

    "correct_answer": "Because dimensions such as length or breadth cannot be negative in a real-world context.",
    "explanation": "In problems dealing with physical measurements like the dimensions of a room or hall, negative values do not make sense as lengths or breadths. Thus, while the quadratic equation may yield a negative root mathematically, it is rejected based on the context of the problem.",

    "correct_answer": "There are two main cases: 1) Distinct real roots, where the factorisation of the quadratic polynomial results in two different linear factors.

    "explanation": "Case 1: If the quadratic polynomial factors into two different linear factors, e.g., (ax + b)(cx + d) = 0, the solutions are obtained by setting each factor to zero, leading to two distinct roots (x = -b/a and x = -d/c). \nCase 2: If the quadratic polynomial can be written as (ex + f)² = 0, then setting the linear factor equal to zero gives one solution, but since the factor is squared, the root is repeated. \nThis distinction is important when analyzing the discriminant (b² - 4ac), which is positive for distinct roots, zero for a repeated root, and negative if complex roots are involved (although complex factorisation may not use real factorisation methods).",
