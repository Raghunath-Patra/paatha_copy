The triangle area depends on the triangle type; for an isosceles triangle formed by two radii and the chord, if the central angle is in radians, then the area can be computed as (1/2)r²sinθ.",
    "explanation": "First, compute the area of the sector using (θ/360) × πr² (or (1/2)r²θ if θ is in radians). Next, determine the area of the triangle inside the sector. For a triangle formed by two radii with an included angle θ (in radians), the area is (1/2)r²sinθ. Subtract the triangle's area from the sector's area to obtain the area of the segment.

    "explanation": "The formula for the area of a sector is (θ/360) × πr². Setting θ = 180° gives (180/360) × πr² = 0.5 × πr². Since the area of the full circle is πr², this result confirms that the area of the sector with a 180° angle is half of the area of the circle.",
