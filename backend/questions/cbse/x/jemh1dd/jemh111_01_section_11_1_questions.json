    "correct_answer": "A sector of a circle is the part of the circular region enclosed by two radii and the arc between them, whereas a segment of a circle is the region enclosed by a chord and the corresponding arc. The key difference is that a sector always has the center of the circle as one of its boundaries, while a segment does not necessarily include the circle’s center.",
    "explanation": "In simple terms, if you draw two radii, the area they enclose together with the intercepted arc forms a sector. In contrast, if you draw a chord (a line segment joining two points on the circle), it creates a segment by partitioning the circle; one part is bounded by the chord and the arc (the segment), and the other part is the remaining area.",

    "explanation": "Since the entire circle has an area of πr², the area corresponding to any sector is proportional to its central angle.

Setting up a proportion, (arc length) / (2πr) = θ / 360°, we solve for the arc length to obtain (arc length) = (θ/360) × 2πr.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Recognize that the entire circle (360°) has a circumference of 2πr.\nStep 2: For an angle θ, the proportionality gives: arc length / (2πr) = θ / 360.\nStep 3: Multiply both sides by 2πr to find: arc length = (θ/360) × 2πr.\nThus, the formula is established.",

The triangle formed by the two radii and the chord can be computed using the formula: (1/2) × r² × sinθ (here, θ should be considered in radians or with appropriate conversion if using degrees). Therefore, the area of the segment is (θ/360) × πr² − (1/2)r² sinθ.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Calculate the area of the sector using the formula (θ/360) × πr².\nStep 2: Determine the area of the triangle. If the central angle is converted to radians or if the sine function accepts degree measures, the area of the triangle is given by (1/2) × r² × sinθ.\nStep 3: Subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the sector:\nArea of segment = (θ/360) × πr² − (1/2)r² sinθ.\nThis provides the required derivation, showing that the segment’s area is the remaining area after removing the triangle from the sector.",
