They minimize multiplication and division errors, reduce computational effort, and allow one to work with smaller, more manageable numbers by subtracting a common value (the assumed mean) from each observation. This also helps in identifying common factors (like the class size h in the step-deviation method) that can be factored out, making manual computations more efficient and less error-prone.",

By choosing an assumed mean (a) near the center of the data, the differences xᵢ - a (dᵢ) are smaller, reducing computation complexity.\n3. In the step-deviation method, dividing these differences by a common factor (h) further simplifies arithmetic.\n4.
