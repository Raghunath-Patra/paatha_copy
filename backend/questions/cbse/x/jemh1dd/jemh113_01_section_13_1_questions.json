    "explanation": "Equal interval histograms are simpler to interpret since each bar represents the same range of values, making the direct visual comparison of frequencies easier.

    "correct_answer": "The median is a robust measure of central tendency that is less affected by extreme values or outliers compared to the mean. Advantages include its resistance to skewness and its usefulness for ordinal data. However, the median may not fully utilize all the information available in the data (i.e., the precise values within intervals) and can be less precise in grouped data, where interpolation is used. For example, in a distribution with a few extremely high incomes, the mean would be pulled upwards while the median gives a better sense of the 'typical' income.",
    "explanation": "Advantages of Median:\n- It is less sensitive to extreme values and outliers, making it a better measure for skewed distributions.\n- It represents the middle of the data, providing a clear point of division where 50% of the data values lie below and 50% above.\nDisadvantages of Median:\n- In grouped data, calculating the median often requires interpolation which may not be as precise.\n- It does not take into account all the data values (loss of information from the distribution).\nConclusion: In symmetric distributions, mean and median are similar, but in skewed distributions, the median is preferred.",
