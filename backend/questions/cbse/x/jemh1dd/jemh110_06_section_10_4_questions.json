Then there exists a small segment along L near T that will lie inside the circle, meaning L intersects the circle at a point other than T. This contradicts the definition of a tangent, which states that a tangent can only touch the circle at one point. Therefore, L must be perpendicular to OT at T.",

Assume by contradiction that L is not perpendicular to OT. Then L would intersect the circle at another point besides T, which is a violation of the tangent property.\n4. Since a tangent must intersect the circle at exactly one point, the only possible configuration is that L is perpendicular to OT.\n5.
