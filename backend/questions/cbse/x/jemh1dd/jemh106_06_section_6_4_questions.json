Join P and Q. Since DP = AB and DQ = AC, and because AB/DE = AC/FD, by applying the converse of Thales’ Theorem, PQ is parallel to EF. This parallelism implies that the corresponding angles ∠P and ∠E (and similarly other angles) are equal.

In right triangles ABE (lamp-post triangle) and CDE (girl and her shadow), since they are similar (both have a right angle and share an angle), we have: (BD + x)/x = AB/CD → (4.8 + x)/x = 3.6/0.9 = 4.
