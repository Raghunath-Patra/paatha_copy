In (i) and (ii), practical factors (like mechanical reliability or sporting ability) do not ensure equal likelihood.

    "correct_answer": "(i) The argument is not correct because when two coins are tossed, the actual sample space consists of 4 equally likely outcomes: (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T). Grouping these outcomes into three events leads to unequal grouping. (ii) The argument is correct because a die has three odd (1, 3, 5) and three even numbers (2, 4, 6), making the probability for odd = 1/2.",
    "explanation": "For (i), although the outcomes can be grouped as two heads, two tails, or one of each, the underlying sample space has 4 outcomes, so the grouped events do not have equal probability unless weighted by the number of favorable outcomes. For (ii), since there are equally 3 odd and 3 even numbers on a die, the probability of getting an odd number is indeed 3/6 = 1/2.",
