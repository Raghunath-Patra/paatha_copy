When the solids are joined, the overlapping surface does not subtract any space from the interiors. Therefore, the total volume V_total = V_c + V_hc. For example, if l = 15, b = 7, h = 8, r = 7/2, and H = 15 (as in the provided example), then V_c = 15×7×8 = 840 m³ and V_hc = ½ × (22/7) × (7/2)² × 15 = 288.75 m³, yielding V_total = 840 + 288.75 = 1128.75 m³.",
