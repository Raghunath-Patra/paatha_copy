Thus, setting mx + n = 0 and px + q = 0 produces the roots of the equation.",

    "correct_answer": "Starting with ax² + bx + c = 0, divide the equation by a (a ≠ 0) to get x² + (b/a)x + c/a = 0. Isolate the constant term: x² + (b/a)x = -c/a. To complete the square, add (b/2a)² = b²/4a² to both sides, obtaining: x² + (b/a)x + b²/4a² = -c/a + b²/4a². The left-hand side becomes (x + b/2a)² and the right-hand side simplifies to (b² - 4ac)/4a². Taking the square root of both sides gives x + b/2a = ± √(b² - 4ac)/ (2a). Subtracting b/2a from both sides, we get x = [ -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ]/(2a).",
