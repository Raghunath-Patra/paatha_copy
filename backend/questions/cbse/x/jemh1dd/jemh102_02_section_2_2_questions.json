    "correct_answer": "A polynomial of degree n is defined by the highest power of x being n. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that there are exactly n complex zeros when counted with multiplicity. When we consider the graph of y = p(x), the number of x-axis intersections represents the number of real zeros. For a linear polynomial (degree 1), the graph is a straight line that can cross the x-axis at only one point. For a quadratic polynomial (degree 2), the parabola can cross the x-axis at two points, one point (if the discriminant is zero), or not at all. For a cubic polynomial (degree 3), the curve can intersect the x-axis at up to three points. Thus, geometrically, a degree n polynomial intersects the x-axis in at most n points, meaning it has at most n real zeros.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Understand that the degree of a polynomial dictates the maximum number of zeros by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. \nStep 2: For a degree 1 polynomial, a straight line intersects the x-axis once. \nStep 3: For a degree 2 polynomial, its parabola may intersect the x-axis at two points, or touch it (one repeated zero) or not intersect at all. \nStep 4: For a degree 3 polynomial, the graph can have up to three intersections. \nConclusion: By this pattern, a degree n polynomial will have at most n zeros.",
