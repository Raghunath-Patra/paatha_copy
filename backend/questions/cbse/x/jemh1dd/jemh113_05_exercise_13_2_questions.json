The mode represents the most frequent age bracket (centred around 36.82 years) while the mean provides the average age (35.38 years), indicating a slight discrepancy that may suggest a mild skew in the distribution.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Identify the modal class which is the class with the highest frequency. Here, the class 35-45 has the highest frequency (23).\n\nStep 2: Use the formula for mode for grouped data:\n    Mode = l + [(f₁ – f₀)/(2f₁ – f₀ – f₂)] × h\nwhere l = lower limit of modal class, h = class width, f₁ = frequency of modal class, f₀ = frequency of the class preceding, f₂ = frequency of the class succeeding.\n\nFor the class 35-45: l = 35, h = 45 - 35 = 10, f₁ = 23, f₀ = 21 (from 25-35), f₂ = 14 (from 45-55).\n    Mode = 35 + [(23 - 21)/(2×23 - 21 - 14)] × 10 = 35 + [2/((46 - 35))] × 10 = 35 + (2/11)×10 ≈ 35 + 1.82 = 36.82\n\nStep 3: Compute the mean using the midpoint method:\n   For each class, calculate the midpoint and multiply by its frequency:\n     5-15: midpoint = 10, product = 6×10 = 60\n     15-25: midpoint = 20, product = 11×20 = 220\n     25-35: midpoint = 30, product = 21×30 = 630\n     35-45: midpoint = 40, product = 23×40 = 920\n     45-55: midpoint = 50, product = 14×50 = 700\n     55-65: midpoint = 60, product = 5×60 = 300\n   Sum of products = 60 + 220 + 630 + 920 + 700 + 300 = 2830\n   Total frequency = 6 + 11 + 21 + 23 + 14 + 5 = 80\n   Mean = 2830 / 80 = 35.38\n\nStep 4: Compare: The mode (≈36.82) is slightly higher than the mean (35.38). This difference helps in interpreting the distribution: while most patients are around 36.82 years (modal value), the average age is lower (35.38 years), indicating a slight skew or spread in the age distribution.",
