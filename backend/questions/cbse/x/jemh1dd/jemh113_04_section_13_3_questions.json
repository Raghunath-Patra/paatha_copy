    "correct_answer": "The mode for grouped data is derived by assuming that the frequency distribution across the modal class can be linearly approximated. Let the modal class be bounded by l (lower limit) and u (upper limit), with class width h, and frequencies f₁ (modal class), f₀ (previous class), and f₂ (next class). By assuming that the increase in frequency from the previous class to the modal class and the decrease from the modal to the next class follows a linear pattern, one can interpolate to find the value within the modal class that corresponds to the highest frequency. The distance (d) from the lower limit of the modal class to the mode is proportional to the difference (f₁ - f₀) relative to the total incremental change (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂). Thus, d = [(f₁ - f₀) / (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h, and adding this to the lower limit gives the mode. Therefore: Mode = l + [(f₁ - f₀) / (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts with the linear interpolation assumption. By drawing a frequency polygon or imagining the shape of the histogram, the point within the modal class where the peak occurs is proportionate to the difference in frequencies of adjacent classes. This leads to the formula Mode = l + [(f₁ - f₀) / (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h, making it possible to estimate the mode even when data is grouped.",

    "correct_answer": "Consider a frequency distribution of test scores where most students score around 45 (modal class) but a few high scores pull the mean up to 60. The modal class is, for example, 40-50 with a frequency of 10, while other classes have lesser frequencies and some extreme high scores raise the mean. This discrepancy indicates a negative skew (tail to the left) where a majority are clustered at the lower end, but a few high values inflate the average. The mode (most frequent score) reflects the common performance level, while the mean is affected by outliers. Hence, when the mode is considerably lower than the mean, it suggests that though most students perform around the mode, exceptional performances are pulling the average up, which should be interpreted carefully in assessment contexts.",
    "explanation": "When analyzing data, if the mode is lower than the mean, it signals the presence of outliers or a skewed distribution. The mode captures the most typical performance, while the mean aggregates all values. The example highlights that policy decisions or interventions might need to address the bulk of performance (mode) rather than the average if the distribution is skewed. This detailed analysis helps in understanding the underlying distribution and in making informed decisions based on the central tendency measures.",
