    "explanation": "For a coin toss, consider the event of landing on its edge. This event is usually excluded, making it impossible; therefore, its probability is 0. In contrast, when a fair die is tossed, the event 'getting a number less than 7' is a sure event because every outcome (1 through 6) satisfies the event, so its probability is 6/6 = 1.

    "correct_answer": "For experiments with infinitely many outcomes, such as the moment a musical chair game stops within a 2-minute interval, probability is defined using geometric measures (like length or area). Here, the probability is the ratio of the favorable measure (time interval, area, etc.) to the total measure.",
    "explanation": "In the musical chair example, the music can stop at any time between 0 and 2 minutes, forming a continuous set of outcomes. The event that the music stops within the first 30 seconds corresponds to a time interval of 0.5 minutes. Assuming a uniform probability distribution over the continuous interval, the probability is calculated as follows:\nP(music stops in first 0.5 min) = (Length of favorable interval) / (Total length of interval) = 0.5 / 2 = 1/4.\nThis approach demonstrates how geometric probability extends the classical definition to continuous outcomes.",
