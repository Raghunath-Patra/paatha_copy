    "correct_answer": "The equation factors as (x + √2)(√2 x + 5) = 0. Therefore, the roots are x = -√2 and x = -5/√2.",
    "explanation": "Consider the equation √2 x² + 7x + 5√2 = 0. First, compute the product a×c = (√2)(5√2) = 10. We need two numbers that multiply to 10 and add up to 7; these are 2 and 5. Split the middle term: √2 x² + 2x + 5x + 5√2 = 0. Group the terms: (√2 x² + 2x) + (5x + 5√2) = 0. Factor the first group as x(√2 x + 2). For the second group, factor out 5 to get 5(x + √2). Notice that (√2 x + 2) can be rewritten as √2(x + (2/√2)) = √2(x + √2). Then the equation becomes √2 x (x + √2) + 5(x + √2) = (x + √2)(√2 x + 5) = 0.

Express y as 27 - x and substitute into the product equation to get: x(27 - x) = 182, which simplifies to x² - 27x + 182 = 0. Factoring, we seek two numbers that multiply to 182 and add to 27. Since 13 and 14 satisfy these conditions (13 + 14 = 27 and 13 × 14 = 182), the solutions are x = 13 and y = 14 or vice versa.",

Subtracting 365 from both sides results in 2n² + 2n - 364 = 0, and dividing through by 2 yields n² + n - 182 = 0. Factoring this quadratic, we find (n - 13)(n + 14) = 0.

    "correct_answer": "Let the base be x cm and the altitude be (x – 7) cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem: x² + (x – 7)² = 13², which simplifies to x² – 7x – 60 = 0.

    "explanation": "Let the base be x cm and the altitude be (x – 7) cm. Since this is a right triangle, apply the Pythagorean theorem: x² + (x – 7)² = 13² = 169. Expand (x – 7)² to get x² – 14x + 49. The equation becomes x² + x² – 14x + 49 = 169, or 2x² – 14x + 49 = 169. Subtract 169 from both sides to obtain 2x² – 14x - 120 = 0. Divide by 2 to get x² – 7x - 60 = 0. Factor as (x – 12)(x + 5) = 0. Since x must be positive, we take x = 12. The altitude is then 12 – 7 = 5 cm.",

Solving this quadratic (using the quadratic formula or factoring after noting that the discriminant is 729, whose square root is 27), we get n = 6 (rejecting the negative solution). The cost per article is then 2(6) + 3 = 15 rupees.",
    "explanation": "Let n be the number of articles produced. According to the problem, the cost per article is 3 rupees more than twice n, i.e., 2n + 3 rupees. The total cost is given as n(2n + 3) = 90. This forms the quadratic equation 2n² + 3n - 90 = 0. Calculate the discriminant: D = 3² + 4×2×90 = 9 + 720 = 729. Since √729 = 27, the solutions for n are given by n = (-3 ± 27)/(4). Taking the positive solution, n = (24/4) = 6. Substituting back, the cost per article is 2×6 + 3 = 15 rupees.",
