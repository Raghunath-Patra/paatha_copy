By converting this quadratic equation into its vertex form, one can easily analyze its vertex, axis of symmetry, and direction of opening. These representations enable further study into intersection points, slopes, distances, and symmetry.",

This becomes y = a(x + b/2a)² - a(b/2a)² + c, which simplifies to y = a(x + b/2a)² + (c - b²/4a). This is the vertex form, clearly indicating that the graph is a parabola with vertex at (-b/2a, c - b²/4a), axis of symmetry x = -b/2a, and opening upwards if a > 0 or downwards if a < 0.",
