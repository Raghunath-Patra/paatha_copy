    "correct_answer": "Assume √5 = a/b where a and b are coprime integers and b ≠ 0. Squaring, we have 5 = a²/b², so a² = 5b². This implies that a² is divisible by 5, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (or Theorem 1.2), a must be divisible by 5. Write a = 5k for some integer k, then substitute back to obtain (5k)² = 5b² or 25k² = 5b², which simplifies to b² = 5k². Thus, b² is divisible by 5, which means b is divisible by 5. But this contradicts the assumption that a and b are coprime. Hence, √5 is irrational.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Assume for contradiction that √5 is rational. Then it can be written as a/b in lowest terms, where a and b are integers with no common factors and b ≠ 0. \nStep 2: Square both sides to get 5 = a²/b², so a² = 5b². \nStep 3: Since 5 divides a², by the theorem used (if a prime divides a² then it divides a), 5 must divide a. Thus, let a = 5k. \nStep 4: Substitute back to get (5k)² = 5b², which simplifies to 25k² = 5b², or equivalently, b² = 5k². \nStep 5: This shows that 5 divides b², so by the same theorem, 5 must divide b. \nStep 6: Since both a and b are divisible by 5, it contradicts the assumption that they have no common factor other than 1. \nStep 7: Therefore, our original assumption is false and √5 must be irrational.",

    "correct_answer": "If 5 - √3 = a/b, then rearranging gives √3 = 5 - (a/b) = (5b - a)/b. Since (5b - a)/b is rational, this implies that √3 is rational. However, the section has already established that √3 is irrational. This contradiction shows that the assumption that 5 - √3 is rational must be false.",
    "explanation": "The solution employs the method of assuming a rational value for 5 - √3, rewriting the equation to express √3 as a rational number. Since this contradicts the proven fact that √3 is irrational, we conclude that 5 - √3 must be irrational.",
