    "correct_answer": "160 cm²",
    "explanation": "Each cube has a volume of 64 cm³ so its side length is 4 cm (since 4³ = 64). When two cubes are joined along one face, they form a cuboid with dimensions 4 cm × 4 cm × 8 cm. Alternatively, one can add the surface areas of the two cubes and subtract the area of the two faces that become internal. The surface area of one cube is 6 × 4² = 96 cm², so two cubes have 192 cm², but the common face (of area 4² = 16 cm²) is counted twice. Thus, the external surface area = 192 − 2×16 = 160 cm².",

    "correct_answer": "572 cm²",
    "explanation": "For the inner surfaces, only the curved parts are considered. The hemisphere has a diameter of 14 cm so its radius r = 7 cm. Its curved (inner) surface area is half the surface area of a sphere: ½×4πr² = 2πr² = 2×(22/7)×7² = 2×(22/7)×49 = 308 cm². The total height is 13 cm, so the height of the cylindrical part is 13 – 7 = 6 cm. The inner lateral surface area of the cylinder is 2πrh = 2×(22/7)×7×6 = 264 cm². Adding these gives 308 + 264 = 572 cm².",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 214.5 cm²",
    "explanation": "In such composite solids where a cone is mounted on a hemisphere with matching bases, the combined total surface area is the sum of the curved surface area (CSA) of the cone and the CSA of the hemisphere (the common circular base is not exposed). \n• The hemisphere of radius r = 3.5 cm has CSA = 2πr² = 2×(22/7)×(3.5)² = 2×(22/7)×12.25 = 77 cm². \n• The total height is 15.5 cm, so the height of the cone is 15.5 − 3.5 = 12 cm. Its slant height l = √(r² + h²) = √(3.5² + 12²) = √(12.25 + 144) = √156.25 = 12.5 cm. \n• The CSA of the cone = πrl = (22/7)×3.5×12.5 = 137.5 cm². \nAdding these, total surface area = 137.5 + 77 = 214.5 cm² (approximately).",

    "correct_answer": "Greatest diameter = 7 cm; Total surface area = 322 cm²",
    "explanation": "For a smooth junction the hemisphere’s base must match the cube’s top face. Hence, the maximum diameter of the hemisphere is equal to the side of the cube, that is 7 cm (radius 3.5 cm). \nThe surface area of the composite solid is calculated by: \n• Cube’s total surface area = 6×7² = 294 cm², but since the top face (area 49 cm²) is in contact with the hemisphere, it is not exposed. Thus, cube’s exposed area = 294 − 49 = 245 cm². \n• The curved surface area (CSA) of the hemisphere = 2πr² = 2×(22/7)×(3.5)² = 77 cm². \nTherefore, total surface area = 245 + 77 = 322 cm².",

When a hemispherical depression (with diameter a and radius a/2) is cut out from one face, the circular area removed (area = π(a/2)² = (πa²/4)) is no longer exposed while the inner curved surface of the hemispherical depression (with area = 2π(a/2)² = (πa²/2)) is added. \nThus, total remaining surface area = [6a² − (πa²/4)] + (πa²/2) = 6a² + (πa²/4).",

Compute the slant height: l = √(r² + h²) = √(0.7² + 2.4²) = √(0.49 + 5.76) = √6.25 = 2.5 cm, so the lateral area of the cone = πrl = (22/7)×0.7×2.5 = 5.5 cm². \nAdding the exposed surfaces gives: 10.56 + 1.54 + 5.5 = 17.6 cm², which rounds to approximately 18 cm².",
