Here, l is the lower limit of the median class, n is the total number of observations, cf is the cumulative frequency of the class preceding the median class, f is the frequency of the median class, and h is the class width. This formula interpolates within the median class assuming that the data is uniformly distributed within the class.",
    "explanation": "To derive the median formula, start with the observation that the median lies at the position n/2. Identify the median class as the first class where the cumulative frequency becomes greater than or equal to n/2. Let the cumulative frequency before the median class be cf. Since the data is assumed to be uniformly distributed within the class, the additional observations required to reach n/2 starting from cf are distributed evenly across the class width h. Hence, the term ((n/2) - cf) indicates how far into the class the median lies and when divided by f (the frequency of the median class) gives the proportion of the class width h that corresponds to this excess. Multiplying this proportion by h and adding to l, the lower limit of the median class, yields the median value.",

Examples include income data where a few very high incomes can raise the average considerably, or property prices in an area where a few expensive houses do not represent the general housing market.",
    "explanation": "In cases where the data is not symmetrically distributed, the mean can be significantly influenced by extreme values. For instance, in a city's income distribution, a small number of high incomes can pull the mean higher than what most people earn, making the median a more representative measure of the central tendency. Similarly, for property prices, if most houses are modestly priced but there are a few luxury homes, the median provides a better indication of the typical market value.",
