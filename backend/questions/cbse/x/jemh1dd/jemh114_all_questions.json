    "correct_answer": "(i) The completed table is as given in the question. (ii) The argument is not correct because the sums of the numbers on two dice do not occur with equal frequency. For example, the sum 7 can occur in 6 different ways whereas the sum 2 can occur in only 1 way. Hence, the probabilities vary and are not all 1/11.",
    "explanation": "When two dice are rolled, the total number of outcomes is 36, but the number of ways to achieve each sum is different. The table shows that sums like 7 have more favourable outcomes (6 ways) compared to sums like 2 or 12 (1 way each). Therefore, it is incorrect to assume each sum has equal probability of 1/11.",

    "explanation": "Total outcomes when tossing a coin 3 times = 2³ = 8. Winning outcomes (all heads or all tails) = 2. Losing outcomes = 8 - 2 = 6, so the probability of losing = 6/8 = 3/4.",

    "question_text": "Which of the following arguments are correct and which are not correct? Give reasons for your answer.\n(i) If two coins are tossed simultaneously there are three possible outcomes—two heads, two tails or one of each. Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the probability is 1/3.\n(ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes—an odd number or an even number.

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(i) The argument is not correct because when two coins are tossed, the actual sample space consists of 4 equally likely outcomes: (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T). Grouping these outcomes into three events leads to unequal grouping. (ii) The argument is correct because a die has three odd (1, 3, 5) and three even numbers (2, 4, 6), making the probability for odd = 1/2.",
    "explanation": "For (i), although the outcomes can be grouped as two heads, two tails, or one of each, the underlying sample space has 4 outcomes, so the grouped events do not have equal probability unless weighted by the number of favorable outcomes. For (ii), since there are equally 3 odd and 3 even numbers on a die, the probability of getting an odd number is indeed 3/6 = 1/2.",
