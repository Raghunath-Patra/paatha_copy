    "correct_answer": "For (i): Using the Basic Proportionality Theorem, AD/DB = AE/EC, so 1.5/3 = 1/EC, which gives 0.5 = 1/EC and hence EC = 2. For (ii): Using DE ∥ BC, we have AD/DB = AE/EC. Here, AE/EC must be computed from the given values. With DB = 7.2 and AE = 1.8, assume the same relation holds; then AD/7.2 = 1.8/5.4 = 1/3, so AD = 7.2/3 = 2.4.",
    "explanation": "Because DE is parallel to BC, by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, the segments are divided proportionally. (i) Write the proportionality relation: AD/DB = AE/EC. Substitute the given values: 1.5/3 = 1/EC → 0.5 = 1/EC, so EC = 2. (ii) Similarly, AD/7.2 = 1.8/5.4; since 1.8/5.4 simplifies to 1/3, it follows that AD = 7.2/3 = 2.4.",
