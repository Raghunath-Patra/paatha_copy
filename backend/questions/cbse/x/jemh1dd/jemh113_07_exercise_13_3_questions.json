    "explanation": "Step 1: Compute the total number of consumers: n = 4 + 5 + 13 + 20 + 14 + 8 + 4 = 68.\n\nStep 2: Find the cumulative frequencies:\n- 65 - 85: 4\n- 85 - 105: 4 + 5 = 9\n- 105 - 125: 9 + 13 = 22\n- 125 - 145: 22 + 20 = 42\n- 145 - 165: 42 + 14 = 56\n- 165 - 185: 56 + 8 = 64\n- 185 - 205: 64 + 4 = 68\n\nStep 3: Median:\nMedian position = n/2 = 68/2 = 34. The 34th observation falls in the 125 - 145 class (cumulative frequency goes from 22 to 42).\nUsing the grouped median formula:\nMedian = l + ((n/2 – cf) / f) × h\nHere, l = 125, cf = 22 (cumulative frequency before the median class), f = 20 (frequency of the median class), and h = 20 (class width).\nMedian = 125 + ((34 – 22) / 20) × 20 = 125 + (12/20)*20 = 125 + 12 = 137 units.\n\nStep 4: Mean:\nFirst, find the midpoint of each class:\n• 65 - 85: midpoint = 75, contribution = 4×75 = 300\n• 85 - 105: midpoint = 95, contribution = 5×95 = 475\n• 105 - 125: midpoint = 115, contribution = 13×115 = 1495\n• 125 - 145: midpoint = 135, contribution = 20×135 = 2700\n• 145 - 165: midpoint = 155, contribution = 14×155 = 2170\n• 165 - 185: midpoint = 175, contribution = 8×175 = 1400\n• 185 - 205: midpoint = 195, contribution = 4×195 = 780\n\nTotal sum = 300 + 475 + 1495 + 2700 + 2170 + 1400 + 780 = 9320.\nMean = 9320 / 68 ≈ 137.06 units.\n\nStep 5: Mode:\nThe modal class is the class with the highest frequency, which is 125 - 145 with f = 20. Let f₀ = 13 (frequency of previous class) and f₂ = 14 (frequency of next class), l = 125, and h = 20.\nMode = l + [(f – f₀) / (2f – f₀ – f₂)] × h\nMode = 125 + [(20 – 13) / (40 – 13 – 14)] × 20 = 125 + [7 / 13] × 20 ≈ 125 + 10.77 ≈ 135.77 units.\n\nComparison: The values of median, mean, and mode are very close (approximately 137, 137.06, and 135.77 respectively), indicating that the distribution is relatively symmetric.",
