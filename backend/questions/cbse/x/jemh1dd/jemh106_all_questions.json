    "type": "Short Answer",

    "correct_answer": "To verify similarity, first establish the correspondence between the vertices of the two quadrilaterals. Measure the angles to ensure that each pair of corresponding angles is equal. Then, measure the lengths of corresponding sides and compute their ratios to see if they are equal (i.e., in constant proportion). For example, if a quadrilateral cardboard ABCD casts a shadow A'B'C'D' due to a light source, using a ruler, verify ∠A = ∠A', ∠B = ∠B', etc., and check that AB/A'B' = BC/B'C' = CD/C'D' = DA/D'A'.",
    "explanation": "The method involves two steps: verifying angle equality and verifying side proportionality. This is analogous to the activity described in the textbook where a cardboard and its shadow demonstrate similarity. Consistent ratio and matching angles confirm that the figures are similar.",

    "correct_answer": "Let the corresponding angles of polygons A, B, and C be denoted by ∠A, ∠B, ∠C respectively. Since A ~ B, we have corresponding angles equal and sides in a constant ratio (say, k₁). Similarly, since B ~ C, corresponding angles are equal with sides in ratio k₂. Thus, the corresponding angles in A and C are equal because ∠A = ∠B = ∠C. Also, the ratio between corresponding sides of A and C is the product of the two scale factors (k₁ × k₂) which is constant for all side pairs. Therefore, by the definition of similarity, A ~ C.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: From A ~ B, we have: (i) ∠A = ∠B and (ii) AB/XY = k₁ for corresponding sides.\nStep 2: From B ~ C, we have: (i) ∠B = ∠C and (ii) XY/UV = k₂ for corresponding sides.\nStep 3: Therefore, ∠A = ∠C and AB/UV = k₁ × k₂, constant for all corresponding sides.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "World maps are drawn with a fixed scale factor, meaning that every linear dimension of the actual geographical area is reduced by the same constant ratio. Since the reduction applies uniformly, the corresponding angles (such as those between coastlines and roads) remain identical, and the ratios between the lengths of various features are preserved. This uniform reduction ensures that the maps maintain the true shape (similarity) of the geographical area, even though they do not reproduce exact sizes.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: The scale factor (or representative fraction) used in maps guarantees that each length in the real world is reduced uniformly. \nStep 2: Because of this constant ratio, all corresponding linear dimensions, such as distances between points, are proportional. \nStep 3: The angles between features remain unchanged since the process of scaling does not distort angles. \nThus, the geometric properties of shapes on the ground (their configuration) are accurately reflected on the map, allowing us to say the map is similar to the actual geographical area.",
