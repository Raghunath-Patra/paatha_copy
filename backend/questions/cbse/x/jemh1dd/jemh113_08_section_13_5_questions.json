Let l be the lower boundary of the modal class, h be the class width, f₁ the frequency of the modal class, f₀ the frequency of the class preceding it, and f₂ the frequency of the class succeeding it. By assuming a linear increase and decrease of frequencies around the modal class, the distance from l to the mode can be estimated by the proportion [(f₁ – f₀)/(2f₁ – f₀ – f₂)] times h. Thus, Mode = l + [(f₁ – f₀)/(2f₁ – f₀ – f₂)] × h. This derivation is based on approximating the frequency distribution within the modal class as linear and finding the point of maximum frequency.",
    "explanation": "Assume a linear variation in frequencies around the modal class. The mode is where the frequency peaks. The distance from the lower limit l to the mode is proportional to (f₁ – f₀) relative to the total width that accounts for increase and subsequent decrease, which is (2f₁ – f₀ – f₂).
