(similar, congruent)\n(iii) All _______ triangles are similar. (isosceles, equilateral)\n(iv) Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (a) their corresponding angles are _______ and (b) their corresponding sides are _______. (equal, proportional)",

    "correct_answer": "(i) similar, (ii) similar, (iii) equilateral, (iv) (a) equal and (b) proportional",
    "explanation": "For (i) and (ii): Although in Class IX congruence is discussed for circles and squares of the same size, when different sizes are considered, they are not congruent but retain the same shape and hence are similar. For (iii): All equilateral triangles have all angles equal (60° each) making any two equilateral triangles similar regardless of their sizes. For (iv): By definition, two polygons (with the same number of sides) are similar if and only if every pair of corresponding angles are equal and every pair of corresponding sides are in the same ratio (i.e., proportional).",

    "correct_answer": "(i) Examples of similar figures: (a) Two circles of different radii; (b) Two equilateral triangles of different sizes.\n(ii) Examples of non-similar figures: (a) A circle and a square; (b) A triangle and a rectangle.",
    "explanation": "For similar figures, the key idea is that the figures have the same shape but can differ in size. Two circles, regardless of their radii, maintain the same shape (all circles are similar), and likewise, all equilateral triangles are similar. For non-similar figures, the shapes must be different. A circle and a square do not have the same shape, nor do a triangle and a rectangle. These examples clearly illustrate the distinction between similarity and non-similarity.",

    "question_text": "State whether the following quadrilaterals are similar or not: [Figure: A rhombus PQRS with side 1.5 cm and a square ABCD with side 3 cm] (Note: Angles are not equal.)",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The quadrilaterals are not similar.",
    "explanation": "For two quadrilaterals to be similar, their corresponding angles must be equal and their corresponding sides must be in the same ratio. In a square, all angles are 90°; however, a rhombus does not necessarily have right angles (unless it is a square). Given that the angles in the rhombus are not equal to 90°, the square and the rhombus cannot be similar, even though the sides might be in a proportional relationship.",
