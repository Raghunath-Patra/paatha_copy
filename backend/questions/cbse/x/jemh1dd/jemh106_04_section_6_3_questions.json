The area of triangle ADE is ½ × AD × h, and the area of triangle BDE is ½ × DB × h. Thus, the ratio of their areas is AD/DB. Similarly, by considering triangles ADE and DEC, the ratio of their areas is AE/EC.

Thus, setting the two ratios equal gives AD/DB = AE/EC, proving the theorem.",

Draw a line DE' through D such that DE' is parallel to BC. By the Basic Proportionality Theorem, we have AD/DB = AE'/E'C. Since AD/DB = AE/EC by assumption, it follows that AE/E C = AE'/E'C, implying AE = AE' and E coincides with E'. This contradiction shows that our assumption is false, and hence DE must be parallel to BC.",
