Squaring both sides, we have 2 = p²/q², so p² = 2q². This means p² is even, so p must be even. Write p = 2k for some integer k. Then p² = 4k², and substituting, 4k² = 2q² gives q² = 2k². Therefore, q² is also even, so q is even. But if both p and q are even, they have a common factor of 2, contradicting our assumption that p/q is in lowest terms. Hence, √2 is irrational.",
    "explanation": "The proof uses contradiction by assuming the opposite of what is to be proved (that √2 is rational) and then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction (both p and q being even contradict the condition that they have no common factors).

    "correct_answer": "Assume that √3 is rational and can be expressed in lowest terms as p/q, where p and q are coprime integers. Then, √3 = p/q implies 3 = p²/q², so p² = 3q². This shows that p² is divisible by 3, and thus p must be divisible by 3 (by the property that if a prime divides a square then it divides the number). Let p = 3k. Then, p² = 9k², and substituting in, we have 9k² = 3q², leading to q² = 3k². This means q² is divisible by 3, hence q is divisible by 3. Therefore, both p and q are divisible by 3, which contradicts the assumption that the fraction p/q is in lowest terms. Hence, √3 is irrational.",
    "explanation": "This proof follows the method of contradiction using the assumption that √3 is rational. By showing that both numerator and denominator must be divisible by 3, we contradict the initial condition of p and q being coprime.

Multiplying the HCF and LCM gives 30240, which is not equal to the direct product of the three numbers, 1,814,400.
