    "correct_answer": "Water – because fire requires fuel, heat, and oxygen, not water.",
    "explanation": "Fire is produced when there is a combination of fuel, heat, and oxygen. Water, in fact, is used to extinguish fire by cooling the material or cutting off oxygen supply.",

    "correct_answer": "CO₂ is stored as a liquid under high pressure in cylinders. When released, it expands into a gas, cools down significantly, and forms a blanket that covers the fire to cut off the oxygen supply.",
    "explanation": "The high-pressure storage allows CO₂ to be in liquid form, which is much denser than its gaseous form. When it is released, the rapid expansion and subsequent cooling help both in cooling the fire and displacing oxygen around it, thereby extinguishing the fire.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Water extinguishes fire primarily by absorbing heat and reducing the temperature of the burning material, and secondly by converting to steam to cut off the oxygen supply. When water is applied to a fire, it absorbs the heat energy from the fuel, lowering its temperature below the ignition level. At the same time, water vapor forms a barrier between the fuel and the air, limiting the access of oxygen required for combustion.",
    "explanation": "The effectiveness of water as an extinguisher is based on two principles: cooling and oxygen exclusion. The cooling lowers the thermal energy below the level needed for combustion, while the water vapor blanket formed prevents further oxygen from reaching the flame, causing the fire to be quenched. This method, however, is only effective for materials like wood and paper, not for fires involving flammable liquids or electrical equipment.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A CO₂ fire extinguisher stores carbon dioxide as a liquid under high pressure. When released, the CO₂ rapidly expands and changes from a liquid to a gas. This expansion causes a significant drop in temperature (a process known as adiabatic cooling). The cold CO₂ gas then blankets the fire, cutting off the supply of oxygen and reducing the temperature of the fuel, thereby extinguishing the fire.",
    "explanation": "The phase change from liquid to gas in a CO₂ extinguisher not only increases the volume dramatically, aiding in covering the burning area, but also cools the environment around the fire. This dual action—removing oxygen and lowering the temperature—stops the chemical reactions necessary for sustained combustion. This is particularly useful for fires involving electrical or flammable chemical materials where water cannot be used.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Water is an effective extinguisher for conventional combustible materials like wood and paper due to its ability to reduce temperature and isolate oxygen; however, it poses serious challenges when used on electrical fires due to its conductivity, and on fires involving oil or petrol because its higher density causes it to sink and leave a burning layer on top. Thus, while water is a common and effective extinguishing agent for many scenarios, its limitations make it unsafe or ineffective in specialized circumstances.",
    "explanation": "The evaluation involves understanding that water works by cooling and oxygen isolation, but it conducts electricity, making it hazardous for electrical fires. Moreover, when water is applied to flammable liquids like oil or petrol, it sinks below the surface, leaving the fuel exposed to oxygen, which can worsen the situation. Therefore, alternative extinguishing agents such as CO₂ or specialized dry powders are recommended for these high-risk scenarios.",

    "correct_answer": "False – In most fire scenarios, especially in buildings, the fuel (e.g., wood, paper, structure) is inherent to the environment and cannot be practically removed.",
    "explanation": "Since the fuel in many cases is the building or the surrounding material that is on fire, it is not feasible to eliminate the source of fuel. Fire control strategies therefore focus on removing other aspects such as oxygen supply or reducing the temperature.",
