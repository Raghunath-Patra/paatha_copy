    "correct_answer": "Adding salt or lemon juice increases the water's conductivity by providing more ions, which carry the electric current. This facilitates the passage of current through the solution and enhances the electrolysis process, leading to observable chemical changes such as gas evolution at the electrodes.",
    "explanation": "Pure water is a poor conductor of electricity because it contains few ions. Salt (NaCl) dissociates into Na⁺ and Cl⁻, and lemon juice contains various acids that dissociate to release H⁺ ions, which improve conductivity and promote electrolysis.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process begins by preparing two electrodes (carbon rods or iron nails) with cleaned metal caps and connecting them to a battery via copper wires. The electrodes are immersed in a conducting solution (water with added salt or lemon juice) in such a way that the metal parts are outside the solution. When the battery is connected, it supplies electric current, which flows through the solution. At the cathode (negative electrode), reduction reactions occur, producing hydrogen gas. At the anode (positive electrode), oxidation reactions occur, which can lead to the formation of oxygen gas or other gases depending on the solute. These chemical reactions result in observable bubbles at the electrodes.",
    "explanation": "Each component in the setup has a specific function: the battery provides energy, the electrodes facilitate the redox reactions by serving as sites for oxidation and reduction, and the added solute ensures the water can conduct the current. This setup is a classic demonstration of the chemical effects of electric current, particularly electrolysis.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The greenish blue spot appearing around the wire connected to the positive terminal suggests that an oxidation reaction occurred at that electrode. This reaction likely involved metal ions (possibly from the copper wire or trace elements present in the potato) that reacted with compounds present in the potato to form a colored deposit. The observation signifies that even organic materials like potato can undergo minor chemical changes when subjected to an electric current.",
    "explanation": "In the potato experiment, the current passing through the potato causes localized chemical reactions. The positive electrode (anode) experiences oxidation, leading to the formation of colored compounds such as copper salts if copper is used, or similar complexes if other metals are present. This experiment highlights that chemical effects of electric current are not limited to aqueous solutions but can also occur in other conductive media.",
