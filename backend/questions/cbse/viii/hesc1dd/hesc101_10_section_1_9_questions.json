    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The drying process involves spreading the freshly harvested grains under the sun for a sufficient period to reduce the moisture content. This process is crucial because high moisture levels encourage the growth of bacteria, fungi, and insects, which can spoil the grains. By reducing moisture, the grains become less hospitable to these organisms, minimizing the risk of spoilage and infestation. Additionally, proper drying ensures that the grains maintain their viability for use as seeds or food.",
    "explanation": "Sun drying is a simple yet effective method to lower grain moisture. By understanding the relationship between moisture and microbial growth, we can appreciate why drying is essential in preserving grain quality. This approach safeguards the grains from deterioration and extends their shelf life.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Domestic storage typically involves smaller quantities of grains stored in methods such as jute bags or metallic bins along with natural repellents like dried neem leaves. In contrast, large-scale storage employs structures such as silos and granaries where grains are stored in bulk. In large godowns, the risk of pest and microbial infestation is higher due to the quantity of grains, hence specific chemical treatments are applied to ensure long-term preservation and to protect against invasive species and microorganisms. The scale and controlled conditions in large storage facilities necessitate these treatments for maintaining grain quality and safety.",
    "explanation": "Home storage often relies on natural methods that are safe and effective for smaller quantities, whereas large-scale storage faces greater challenges in terms of pest management and environmental control, warranting the use of chemical treatments.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed by taking two sets of freshly harvested grains: one set that is sun-dried to reduce moisture, and another set that remains undried. Both sets should be stored under similar environmental conditions. Over the course of one month, periodic observations should be made to record the presence and extent of fungal growth using a standardized rating scale. Control measures would include keeping the same storage container types, ambient temperature, and handling procedures for both samples. It is expected that the dried grain set will show little to no fungal growth, while the undried set will exhibit significantly more fungal presence, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the drying process.",
    "explanation": "This experiment uses a control (undried grains) to compare the impact of drying. By controlling variables such as storage conditions and temperature, the only variable affecting fungal growth is the moisture content, allowing for clear conclusions about the benefits of drying grains.",
