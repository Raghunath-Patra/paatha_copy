    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The formation of fossil fuels begins with the accumulation of dead plants and animals in environments such as swamps and seabeds. Over millions of years, these organic remains are buried under layers of sediment, where heat and pressure chemically transform them into coal, petroleum, or natural gas. This slow geological process implies that fossil fuels are non-renewable, and once we deplete current reserves, they cannot be easily replenished.",
    "explanation": "This process, known as diagenesis and catagenesis, takes millions of years. The slow rate at which these fuels form means that human consumption far outpaces their natural replenishment, rendering them limited resources. Their usage also brings environmental challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.",

However, challenges may include the need for widespread driver education, changes in driving habits, and the initial costs related to vehicle maintenance and upgrades.",

    "correct_answer": "Fossil fuel usage has severe environmental impacts including air pollution, global warming, and ecological degradation due to emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. To reduce dependence on these resources, alternative solutions include increasing investments in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power, and enhancing energy efficiency in industries and transportation. Additionally, promoting public transport and electric vehicles can further mitigate fossil fuel demand.",
    "explanation": "Evaluating the extensive negative impacts of fossil fuel combustion makes it essential to look at alternatives that lessen environmental harm. Renewable energy technologies provide sustainable energy solutions because they are replenished naturally. Moreover, energy efficiency measures reduce overall energy consumption. Combining these approaches can significantly lower dependency on non-renewable resources.",
