    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Tools such as knives, needles, and drill bits are designed with sharp edges or points to concentrate the applied force over a very small area, increasing the pressure. This high pressure makes it easier to cut or pierce materials with less force.",
    "explanation": "By reducing the area of contact, the same amount of force produces a higher pressure, allowing tools to perform cutting or piercing functions more efficiently. This principle is essential in the design of various tools and devices in everyday life and industry.",
