    "correct_answer": "Seasonal changes, such as a drop in temperature or food availability, directly affect the timing and routes of bird migration as they move to areas with better living conditions.",
    "explanation": "Birds are highly sensitive to seasonal fluctuations; as winter approaches, the lack of food and the cold weather push birds to migrate to regions where conditions are optimal for breeding and feeding.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Bird migration is a seasonal movement primarily driven by the need to find favorable climatic conditions for breeding and feeding. Birds typically initiate migration when their original habitat becomes too cold or food becomes scarce. The process involves long, often dangerous flights across continents or regions, using environmental cues like day length and temperature changes. Factors such as wind patterns, the availability of stopover sites, and the presence of predators also influence the route and success of migration.",
    "explanation": "This detailed explanation covers the reasons (climate change and resource availability), timing (seasonal cues), and process (long-distance travel with stopover sites) of migration. It also highlights external factors like weather and ecological conditions that significantly affect migratory paths.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Climate change can both alter the timing and routes of bird migration. Warmer temperatures can cause birds to delay migration or choose different breeding areas, while erratic weather patterns may lead to increased mortality during migration. Additionally, changing climates can result in habitat loss or altered food availability along migratory routes, potentially disrupting evolutionary adaptations and local ecosystems.",
    "explanation": "This answer requires evaluating multiple dimensions of climate change, including its effects on migration timing, route selection, and the overall survival and reproduction of migratory bird species. It suggests a need for further research and conservation efforts in the face of evolving environmental challenges.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment could involve selecting multiple stopover sites with varying proximities to water bodies (such as reservoirs, lakes, or rivers). The independent variable would be the distance from a water body, while the dependent variable would be the number of migratory birds stopping over at each site. Controls could include similar habitat types, weather conditions, and time of day. Data could be collected through direct observation, automated bird counting using sensors or cameras, and recording environmental factors. Statistical analysis would then be used to determine the correlation between water proximity and stopover frequency.",
