    "explanation": "When the archer stretches the bow, its shape changes. The force required for this is supplied by her muscles (muscular force), which is a contact force. However, once the arrow is released it is propelled without further physical contact; the forces acting on it include gravity (a non-contact force) and friction (air resistance).",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "correct_answer": "For (a): Agent – Fingers; Object – Lemon; Effect – Juice is extracted. For (b): Agent – Hand applying pressure; Object – Toothpaste; Effect – Paste is extruded from the tube. For (c): Agent – Gravitational force acting on the load and the upward spring tension; Object – The load; Effect – The load remains in equilibrium. For (d): Agent – Muscular force (via the legs pushing against the ground); Object – The athlete; Effect – The athlete is propelled upward to clear the bar.",
    "explanation": "Each scenario involves identifying both the source of the force (agent) and the receiver (object), plus describing the outcome. In squeezing and toothpaste examples, the applied muscular force causes a change (extraction or extrusion), while in the suspended load, balanced forces result in equilibrium, and the athlete’s jump involves converting muscular energy into kinetic energy.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The force responsible is the electrostatic force.",
    "explanation": "Rubbing the balloon with synthetic cloth causes it to acquire an electrostatic charge. When the charged balloon is brought near the wall, an attractive electrostatic force develops between the oppositely charged regions (or induced charges) on the balloon and the wall, which causes the balloon to stick.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The forces acting on the bucket are primarily the gravitational force acting downward and the upward force exerted by your hand (which includes a muscular force and a normal force). Since these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they balance each other, resulting in no net force and therefore no change in the state of motion (equilibrium).",
    "explanation": "The bucket remains stationary because the sum of the forces (vector sum) acting on it is zero. This is a classic case of equilibrium where the downward gravitational force is exactly countered by the upward force applied by the hand. No acceleration occurs as per Newton’s first law of motion.",

    "correct_answer": "The two forces acting on the rocket are the upward thrust provided by the rocket’s engines and the downward gravitational force (weight) of the rocket.",
    "explanation": "Immediately after launch, a rocket experiences a propulsive force (thrust) that accelerates it upward while gravity constantly exerts a downward pull. If the thrust is greater than the gravitational force, the rocket accelerates upward.",

    "correct_answer": "atmospheric pressure",
    "explanation": "When the pressure on the rubber bulb is released, the higher atmospheric pressure outside the dropper forces water into the dropper. The water’s rise is not due to its own pressure or gravity acting alone, but primarily because of the atmospheric pressure difference.",

Place a wooden or plastic stool on the sand bed (with graph paper strips on one leg to mark the sand level) in two different orientations—as a normal stool (with legs on the ground) and turned upside down (with the seat on the sand). With the same load (for example, a school bag full of books) placed on the stool, measure the depth to which the stool sinks in the sand in both cases, and compare the pressure exerted by the stool in the two situations.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiment is expected to show that when the stool has a smaller area of contact with the sand (for example, when turned upside down), the pressure (force per unit area) exerted on the sand is higher, leading to a greater penetration depth. Conversely, when the contact area is larger (when standing normally), the pressure is lower and the sinking is less pronounced.",
    "explanation": "Pressure is defined as the force applied per unit area. In this project, with the same load, a smaller contact area causes a higher pressure, which can be observed as a deeper sink into the sand. This practical experiment demonstrates the relationship between force, area, and pressure.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The cover remains in place because atmospheric pressure acting on the outside of the tumbler is greater than the pressure of the air inside after inversion. This pressure difference holds the cover tightly against the mouth of the tumbler, preventing water from spilling out.",
    "explanation": "When the tumbler is inverted, the air inside does not expand quickly enough to match the lower external pressure. The high atmospheric pressure outside exerts a force that counteracts the weight of the water, keeping the cover in place. This experiment qualitatively demonstrates the effect of atmospheric pressure.",

    "correct_answer": "The water will eventually level out across all the interconnected bottles because, according to the principle of communicating vessels, the liquid in connected containers will seek the same level due to equal pressure at the same depth.",
    "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates that in interconnected vessels, pressure at a given depth is the same, leading to an equal distribution of water.
