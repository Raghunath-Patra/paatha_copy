    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The formation of petroleum begins with the accumulation of dead marine organisms that sink to the bottom of the sea. Over time, these remains are buried by sediments like sand and clay in a process known as sedimentation. Under the cover of these sediments, the organic matter is subjected to increasing pressure and temperature. The absence of oxygen (anoxic conditions) prevents the complete decay of organic materials, allowing them to chemically transform into simpler hydrocarbon compounds. Over millions of years, these compounds mature into petroleum and natural gas, which then get trapped in porous reservoir rocks with a layer of impermeable rock above, forming a natural storage.",
    "explanation": "This process, called diagenesis (early stage) followed by catagenesis (maturation), transforms once living organisms into a mixture of hydrocarbons. The geological conditions, including temperature, pressure, and oxygen availability, are crucial to ensure that the organic matter alters into oil and gas rather than decaying completely.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The refining process of petroleum involves separating its various hydrocarbon components through a technique called fractional distillation. In the refinery, petroleum is heated in a furnace until it vaporizes. The vapor then enters distillation towers where different fractions condense at different levels, based on their boiling points. Fractions such as petroleum gas, petrol, kerosene, diesel, lubricating oil, paraffin wax, and bitumen are collected in separate chambers. Each fraction has specific properties that make it useful for various applications—petrol is used in light vehicles, diesel in heavy motor vehicles, kerosene in jet fuel and lamps, and lubricating oil in machinery.",
    "explanation": "The design of distillation towers allows for the separation of components by temperature differences. The refining process not only provides fuels but also petrochemicals that are essential for manufacturing plastics, fibres, and detergents. This detailed separation and usage of different fractions underscore the economic importance of petroleum refining.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Refining petroleum separates it into distinct hydrocarbon fractions using fractional distillation. Certain fractions, once further processed, lead to the creation of petrochemicals—raw materials that are transformed into everyday products. For instance, chemicals derived from these fractions are polymerized to make plastics, or processed into fibres such as polyester and nylon. Additionally, other chemicals derived from petroleum contribute to manufacturing detergents. This interconnected set of processes demonstrates how refining petroleum not only provides fuels but also forms the backbone of a wide variety of industrial goods.",
    "explanation": "The transformation of raw petroleum into petrochemicals is a multi-step process involving chemical reactions that convert hydrocarbons into building blocks for polymers and other chemicals.
