    "correct_answer": "Engineers minimize friction by using lubricants (like oil or grease) to create a smoother surface between moving parts, and by designing components with smoother or more aerodynamic surfaces. The lubricant reduces direct surface contact, while improved design minimizes resistance.",
    "explanation": "Lubricants work on the principle of creating a fluid film between surfaces, thereby reducing direct contact and friction.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Friction is termed a 'necessary evil' because, while it is essential for most everyday tasks like walking, writing, and vehicle control, it also causes unwanted effects such as wear and tear of materials and energy loss in machines. Beneficial examples include: 1) Friction between shoes and the ground allowing us to walk without slipping, and 2) Friction between pencil and paper enabling us to write. Harmful examples include: 1) Friction in mechanical parts causing wear and reducing efficiency, and 2) Heat generation through friction that leads to energy wastage in machines.",
    "explanation": "The positive side of friction facilitates basic human functions and safety by providing the grip needed in various applications, while the negative aspect leads to deterioration in materials and undesirable energy conversion into heat, thereby lowering efficiency.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Friction between a car's tires and the road is critical for maneuverability, acceleration, and braking, directly influencing safety. However, excessive friction in moving parts can lead to energy losses (converted to heat) and accelerated wear of components, affecting fuel efficiency and durability. Engineers employ lubricants, advanced materials, and precision engineering (such as ball bearings and aerodynamic designs) to reduce friction in non-critical areas while maintaining sufficient tire-road friction for control.",
    "explanation": "While tire-road friction is necessary for safe driving, friction in engine components wastes energy by converting kinetic energy into unwanted heat. The use of lubricants reduces direct metal-to-metal contact in engines and machinery. Additionally, careful design and high-quality materials help mitigate frictional losses, ensuring better performance and longer-lasting vehicles.",
