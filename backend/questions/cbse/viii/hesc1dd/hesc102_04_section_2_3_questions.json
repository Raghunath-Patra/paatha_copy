    "correct_answer": "Yeast ferments sugars present in the dough, converting them into ethanol and carbon dioxide through the reaction: C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2 C₂H₅OH + 2 CO₂. The carbon dioxide gas forms bubbles within the dough, making it puffy and increasing its volume. The ethanol evaporates during baking, leaving behind the airy texture.",
    "explanation": "This process not only improves the texture and flavor of bread but is also a fundamental example of fermentation in food science. The trapped gas bubbles help the dough expand, resulting in soft, light bread.",

    "correct_answer": "Vaccines work by introducing dead or weakened microorganisms into the body. This triggers the immune system to produce antibodies without causing the disease. Once the body generates these antibodies, it 'remembers' the pathogen, allowing for a quicker and more effective response if exposed to the actual harmful microbe in the future.",
    "explanation": "This active immunization builds long-term protection. The process involves recognition of antigens, activation of immune cells, and the formation of memory cells that safeguard against future infections.

In contrast, harmful microorganisms cause diseases and infections. While the former are harnessed for their positive uses in industry and health, the latter require control through medical interventions such as antibiotics to prevent illnesses.",
