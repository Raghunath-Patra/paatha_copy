Safety precautions include protecting eyes from direct sunlight and ensuring that the mirror does not reflect sunlight into people's eyes.",
    "explanation": "By directing sunlight through a slit (or using a suitable apparatus), a narrow beam is obtained. The beam will strike the plane mirror and reflect according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection).

As the light passes through the water, it is refracted because water has a different refractive index than air.

The resulting spectrum is then projected onto a surface, demonstrating that white light is a mixture of multiple colours.",

In the experiment, white light is split into its constituent colours using a combination of reflection by the mirror and refraction by the water. Similarly, a rainbow is formed when sunlight is refracted, dispersed, and then reflected inside water droplets in the atmosphere. The similarity lies in the separation of light into a spectrum of colours due to refraction and dispersion.

As the colored pieces continuously move due to rotation or shaking, the arrangement of reflected images constantly changes, ensuring that no two patterns are exactly alike.",
    "explanation": "The key to the kaleidoscope’s functionality is the repeated reflection from the mirrors, which are precisely angled to reflect the image of the colored fragments multiple times. This creates a mirror symmetry that is pleasing to the eye. Because small changes in the position of the colored glass pieces result in an entirely different pattern, the pattern seen through the viewing hole is always new.

    "explanation": "In a plane mirror, the image appears as far behind the mirror as the object is in front, thus an object at 1 m appears 2 m away from the viewer. The mirror laterally inverts images, so touching the left ear appears as if the right ear is being touched by the corresponding opposite hand. In dim light, the pupil dilates (increases in size) to allow more light in, and nocturnal birds have a higher number of rods (light-sensitive cells) than cones (colour-sensitive cells), meaning they have fewer cones.",

When you look through the small viewing hole and rotate the kaleidoscope, multiple reflections between the inclined mirrors create intricate and symmetrical patterns.",

    "correct_answer": "Persistence of vision is the phenomenon where the image of an object remains on the retina for about 1/16th of a second after the object is removed. This allows a series of rapidly displayed still images (at a rate faster than 16 per second) to be perceived as a continuous moving picture, which is the principle behind motion pictures.",
    "explanation": "When still images are flashed quickly in sequence—such as the 24 frames per second in movies—the short-term persistence of each image blends with the next. The brain interprets this sequence as fluid motion, thus creating the illusion of continuous movement.",

Cones, on the other hand, require brighter light to function but allow us to see color and fine detail. This division of labor enables the human visual system to adapt to a wide range of lighting conditions, ensuring effective vision during both day and night.",
    "explanation": "The rods and cones work together: rods provide the necessary sensitivity for night vision, while cones produce the detailed and colorful images in daylight.
