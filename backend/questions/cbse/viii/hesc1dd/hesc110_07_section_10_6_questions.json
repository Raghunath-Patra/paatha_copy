      "A. They produce too little energy to be detected.",

    "correct_answer": "B. They cause vibrations that are too slow for our ear’s sensory cells to register. The human auditory system is not capable of processing such slow vibrations effectively.",
    "explanation": "The human ear has limitations in its ability to sense very slow vibrations, typically below 20 Hz, which is why these low-frequency sounds do not register as audible.",

    "correct_answer": "A vibrating body is an object that moves back and forth, creating vibrations in the surrounding medium (such as air) which propagate as sound waves.",

    "correct_answer": "Frequencies below 20 Hz are inaudible because the human ear is not sensitive enough to detect such slow vibrations, which arise from the limitations in the basilar membrane’s mechanical response within the inner ear.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The human ear perceives sounds between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, limiting our ability to detect sounds outside this range. This limitation means that devices or systems, such as ultrasound imaging, high-frequency dog whistles, or ultrasonic sensors, are designed to operate outside the audible range to avoid interference with human hearing or to utilize special properties of higher frequencies.",
    "explanation": "The limitations in the human audible range arise from the physiological design of our ears. Engineers and scientists leverage this fact by designing devices that operate in inaudible ranges. For instance, ultrasound can penetrate tissue without being heard or causing discomfort, and high-frequency whistles are effective for dog training since dogs can hear frequencies beyond the human range.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ultrasound equipment emits high-frequency sound waves (above 20 kHz) that travel through the body and reflect off internal structures. These echoes are captured by sensors and converted into images. Because these frequencies are inaudible to humans, ultrasound is a safe and non-invasive diagnostic tool.",
    "explanation": "The process involves transmitting inaudible, high-frequency waves that penetrate the body. When these waves encounter tissues of different densities, they are reflected back at varying intensities and times. The device receives these echoes and, using computer processing, reconstructs them into visual images that help diagnose medical conditions without exposing the patient to harmful radiation.",
