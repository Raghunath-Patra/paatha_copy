    "correct_answer": "Direct view involves light traveling in a straight line from the object to your eyes, whereas reflected view involves light bouncing off a surface (like a mirror) before reaching your eyes. In reflected views, the light changes direction upon hitting the reflective surface as per the law of reflection.",
    "explanation": "The key difference is the change in the path of light. In a direct view, the observer sees the object directly, but in a reflected view, the object is viewed indirectly after the light undergoes one or more reflections.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A periscope consists of two plane mirrors installed at 45° angles to the line of sight. The upper mirror receives light from an object that is not in the observer's line of sight and reflects it downward due to the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection). The lower mirror then reflects this light sideways into the observer's eye. This configuration allows the observer to see objects obscured by obstacles.",
    "explanation": "Each mirror in the periscope is strategically placed so that light is guided along a bent pathway. The consistent use of the law of reflection ensures that the light changes direction appropriately, allowing an image from a hidden object to be accurately transmitted to the viewer. This principle is also applied in optical devices across various fields like military and marine applications.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the hairdresser's mirror setup, the process begins when light hits your back, reflects off the second mirror (held behind your head), and then travels toward the front mirror. The front mirror then reflects this light into your eyes, allowing you to see the back of your head despite it not being in your direct line of sight. To demonstrate consecutive reflections, set up two plane mirrors at an angle (for instance, placing one mirror flat and another at a 45° angle on a table). Shine a laser pointer or use a flashlight onto the first mirror so that the reflected beam strikes the second mirror and then observe the final reflected beam on a screen or wall. Measure the angles to confirm that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection each time.",
    "explanation": "This experiment replicates the principle of consecutive reflections in devices like periscopes and the hairdresser mirror setup. Observing the angles and the path of light physicalizes the abstract concept of reflection, reinforcing the understanding that light obeys specific predictable laws.",
