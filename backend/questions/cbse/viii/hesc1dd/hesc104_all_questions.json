    "correct_answer": "Combustion requires a fuel, oxygen (from air), and heat (to raise the fuel’s temperature to its ignition point).",
    "explanation": "For combustion to occur, three components must be present: a combustible substance (fuel), an oxidising agent (usually oxygen from air), and sufficient heat to raise the fuel to its ignition temperature. This concept is often depicted as the fire triangle.",

    "explanation": "When wood or coal burns, it consumes oxygen from the air. Kerosene is a commonly used liquid fuel in homes. A fuel must be heated to its ignition temperature— the minimum temperature needed to start combustion. Lastly, oil fires do not respond to water because water can sink beneath the oil, preventing effective extinguishment.",

    "correct_answer": "CNG burns more cleanly than petrol or diesel because it produces significantly lower emissions of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), sulphur dioxide (SO₂), and particulate matter. This cleaner combustion leads to improved air quality in urban areas.",
    "explanation": "Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is primarily composed of methane, which undergoes more complete combustion compared to conventional fuels. This results in a reduction in harmful emissions, thereby decreasing overall air pollution.

In contrast, wood, which is a solid fuel, burns slower and less efficiently, often emitting more smoke and particulate matter, and its use may also lead to deforestation.",
    "explanation": "LPG is stored under pressure and, when used, allows for regulated combustion with better energy output and fewer harmful emissions. Wood, although renewable, tends to burn unevenly, releasing more pollutants and particulate matter.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Water is a good conductor of electricity, which makes it dangerous for use on electrical fires due to the risk of electrical shock and further short-circuiting. (b) LPG burns more efficiently, produces a cleaner flame with higher calorific value and minimal smoke, making it more suitable for domestic use. (c) An aluminium pipe acts as a heat sink, drawing heat away from the paper and preventing it from reaching its ignition temperature, whereas loose paper heats up quickly and ignites easily.",
    "explanation": "Electrical equipment requires non-conductive methods for fire control, hence water is unsuitable. LPG’s efficient, controlled combustion makes it a preferable domestic fuel over wood, which burns less efficiently and produces more pollutants.

Because CO₂ is heavier than air, it forms a blanket over the burning material, cutting off the oxygen supply, while its rapid expansion also cools the fuel below its ignition temperature.",
    "explanation": "Fire requires oxygen to sustain combustion. When CO₂ is used, it covers the fire and pushes away oxygen, thereby starving the flame.

    "correct_answer": "One can design an experiment using a simple calorimeter. For example, select wood (solid fuel) and kerosene oil (liquid fuel). Materials needed include a calorimeter, thermometer, measuring cylinder, electronic balance, and a stand to hold the fuel. The procedure involves weighing a fixed amount of each fuel, burning them under controlled conditions in a calorimeter containing a known mass of water, and measuring the temperature rise. The heat produced (using Q = m × c × ΔT, where m is mass of water, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change) per unit weight of the fuel can then be calculated to compare efficiencies. Control variables such as air flow and initial water temperature must be maintained for accuracy.",

    "correct_answer": "A possible experimental design would include using candles with different wick lengths while keeping other properties (such as candle size and wax type) constant. The setup would involve a thermocouple or infrared thermometer to measure temperature at different zones of the flame, specifically in the innermost, middle, and outermost zones. Data collection would be done by recording temperatures at fixed intervals and under controlled conditions (no wind, constant ambient temperature). The independent variable is wick length, while dependent variables are the measured temperatures in each zone. It is expected that longer wick lengths might produce a larger flame with altered temperature gradients, possibly due to changes in fuel vaporisation rates and oxygen availability.",

    "correct_answer": "Water extinguishes fire primarily by absorbing heat and reducing the temperature of the burning material, and secondly by converting to steam to cut off the oxygen supply. When water is applied to a fire, it absorbs the heat energy from the fuel, lowering its temperature below the ignition level. At the same time, water vapor forms a barrier between the fuel and the air, limiting the access of oxygen required for combustion.",
    "explanation": "The effectiveness of water as an extinguisher is based on two principles: cooling and oxygen exclusion. The cooling lowers the thermal energy below the level needed for combustion, while the water vapor blanket formed prevents further oxygen from reaching the flame, causing the fire to be quenched.

    "correct_answer": "A CO₂ fire extinguisher stores carbon dioxide as a liquid under high pressure. When released, the CO₂ rapidly expands and changes from a liquid to a gas. This expansion causes a significant drop in temperature (a process known as adiabatic cooling). The cold CO₂ gas then blankets the fire, cutting off the supply of oxygen and reducing the temperature of the fuel, thereby extinguishing the fire.",
    "explanation": "The phase change from liquid to gas in a CO₂ extinguisher not only increases the volume dramatically, aiding in covering the burning area, but also cools the environment around the fire.

Thus, while water is a common and effective extinguishing agent for many scenarios, its limitations make it unsafe or ineffective in specialized circumstances.",
    "explanation": "The evaluation involves understanding that water works by cooling and oxygen isolation, but it conducts electricity, making it hazardous for electrical fires.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The physical state of a fuel greatly influences its combustion behavior and ignition temperature. Solids, such as wood or paper, generally require a higher surface area to ignite and their internal structure can affect heat conduction. Liquids like kerosene oil evaporate to form flammable vapors, meaning they have lower ignition temperatures once vaporized compared to solids. Gaseous fuels mix readily with air, leading to rapid combustion once the ignition point is reached. In practical applications, gas stoves utilize gaseous fuels for quick ignition; liquid fuels are used in engines after vaporization; and the combustion of solids is harnessed in applications like firewood burning where controlled heat release is necessary.",
    "explanation": "The state influences factors like fuel vaporization, surface area, and heat transfer. For example, liquid fuels produce combustible vapors that can ignite easily when mixed with air, while solid fuels require sufficient heat to break down and release combustible compounds.

A typical reaction for a hydrocarbon fuel might be: CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O + energy. The variations in flame colour occur because different substances emit characteristic wavelengths of light depending on the energy levels involved in their electron transitions.",
