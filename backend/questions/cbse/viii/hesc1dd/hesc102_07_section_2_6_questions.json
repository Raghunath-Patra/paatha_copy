    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Lightning causes the nitrogen in the air to react with oxygen, forming nitrogen oxides that eventually produce nitrates. However, this process is not sufficient to account for the overall constant level of atmospheric nitrogen because the majority of nitrogen fixation is carried out biologically by bacteria in soil and plant root nodules.",
    "explanation": "Lightning provides energy that breaks the strong Nâ‰¡N bond, allowing nitrogen to combine with oxygen to form compounds like NO and NO2, which then react to form nitrates. Despite its importance, the contribution from lightning is minor compared to biological nitrogen fixation, which plays the dominant role in the nitrogen cycle.",

    "correct_answer": "Nitrogen fixation by Rhizobium is an example of mutualism because both the bacteria and the host leguminous plants benefit from the association; the plant receives fixed nitrogen needed for growth, while the bacteria obtain carbohydrates and a protective environment.",
    "explanation": "In mutualism, both parties involved in the interaction benefit. The leguminous plant gains access to a nitrogen source in a usable form, which is essential for synthesizing proteins and other nitrogenous compounds.

    "explanation": "Although lightning plays a role in fixing nitrogen, its effect is limited compared to the extensive role of biological nitrogen fixation.

This balance maintains a steady state in the nitrogen cycle.",
    "explanation": "The nitrogen cycle is a dynamic equilibrium where biological processes, such as fixation by Rhizobium and conversion by lightning, are offset by processes such as denitrification carried out by bacteria.
