    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hormonal regulation in the body starts with the pituitary gland, which releases specific hormones that act as signals to target endocrine glands. The thyroid, for instance, receives these signals and produces thyroxine, which regulates metabolic processes. Similarly, the adrenal glands are stimulated to secrete hormones like adrenalin, which prepare the body for stress responses. This hierarchical control ensures that various body functions such as metabolism, growth, and stress management are synchronized and maintained.",
    "explanation": "The pituitary gland, often called the 'master gland,' orchestrates overall endocrine function. Its hormones prompt secondary glands to produce their respective hormones; for example, stimulation of the thyroid leads to thyroxine production essential for metabolism, while the adrenal glandâ€™s secretion of adrenalin regulates the fight-or-flight response. This organized feedback mechanism is central to maintaining homeostasis.",

    "correct_answer": "The thyroid gland secretes thyroxine, which regulates metabolism and energy production; the pancreas produces insulin, crucial for controlling blood sugar levels; and the adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenalin that help the body adjust to stress and maintain salt balance. Although each gland produces different hormones, they all contribute to the overall balance of the body's internal environment. The thyroid affects metabolic rate, the pancreas manages energy via glucose metabolism, and the adrenals provide rapid responses in emergency situations, showcasing a well-coordinated endocrine system.",
    "explanation": "Each gland plays a unique role in homeostasis: the thyroid modulates metabolic processes, the pancreas regulates energy through insulin and glucose control, and the adrenal glands manage electrolyte balance and stress responses.
