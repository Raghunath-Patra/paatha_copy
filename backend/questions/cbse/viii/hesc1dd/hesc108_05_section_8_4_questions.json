    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be set up by rolling a ball on a flat surface and then placing a ruler in its path at various angles. When the ball strikes the ruler, if the ruler is aligned with the motion, the ball mostly slows down or stops (force acting opposite). If placed obliquely, the ball changes direction, showing both a change in speed and direction. Observations include a varying trajectory based on the angle and the force exerted by the ruler. The physics behind these changes stems from Newton's laws of motion: an unbalanced force changes the state of motion of the ball.",
    "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates that forces can alter an object’s speed or direction. By varying the angle of the ruler, you can analyze the directional change component, and when the force opposes the motion, the speed decreases. Newton's laws explain that forces cause acceleration, which equates to changes in velocity (both speed and direction).",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In football, a player's kick applies a force on a stationary ball to start its motion, while a goalkeeper's dive may apply an opposite force to stop or deflect the ball. In cricket, the batsman applies a force on the ball, altering both speed and direction depending on the shot played. In volleyball, players use forces by pushing, setting, or smashing the ball, thus changing its direction and speed to suit the play. Each scenario demonstrates that forces can cause changes in speed, direction, or both, which collectively define the state of motion.",
    "explanation": "These examples show practical applications of the concept that forces change the state of an object's motion. They demonstrate varying outcomes depending on the direction, magnitude, and point of application of the forces involved. Such analysis requires an understanding of Newton's laws of motion, friction, and interaction forces.",
