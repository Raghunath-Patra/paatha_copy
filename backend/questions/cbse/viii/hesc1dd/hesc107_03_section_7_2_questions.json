    "correct_answer": "The percentage data in the growth chart reflects the proportion of the adult height that a person has achieved at a given age. By applying the formula: Full Height = (Present Height / Percentage) * 100, one can estimate the probable adult height, taking into account individual variations in growth rates.",
    "explanation": "This approach provides a systematic method to forecast adult height by using average growth data. It acknowledges that while growth patterns can vary, the percentage completion of growth acts as a useful reference in predicting future height.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process involves using the formula Full Height (cm) = (Present height (cm) / % of full height at this age) * 100. This calculation requires knowing the person's current height and the percentage of full height they have achieved at their current age, as indicated in the growth chart. For example, for a 9-year-old boy with a height of 120 cm, if he has reached 75% of his full height, the calculation is (120 / 75) * 100 = 160 cm, which is his estimated adult height.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Nutrition plays a critical role in adolescent growth as it provides the necessary nutrients to support the development of bones, muscles, and other body tissues. During puberty, growth rates are high, and the body requires an adequate supply of proteins, vitamins, and minerals to ensure proper growth and development. Poor nutrition during these crucial years can result in stunted growth and delayed development. Additionally, a balanced diet supports endocrine function and hormonal balance, which are vital for the changes occurring during puberty.",
