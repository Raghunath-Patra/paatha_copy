    "explanation": "Sliding friction occurs when two surfaces are already in relative motion, which means the microscopic irregularities have less time to interlock compared to when the object is at rest. Therefore, less force is required to maintain movement once it has started.",

    "correct_answer": "Wrapping the brick with polythene, a smoother material, reduces friction by lessening surface roughness, resulting in a lower force reading on the spring balance. Conversely, wrapping with jute, which is rougher, increases friction, leading to a higher force reading.",
    "explanation": "The degree of surface roughness affects how much the microscopic irregularities on the surfaces interlock. Smoother surfaces (like polythene) have fewer irregularities in contact, resulting in lower friction, while rough surfaces (like jute) have more pronounced irregularities that interlock more strongly, increasing friction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the pencil cell moves from the inclined plane onto a smooth table, it travels the farthest distance because the friction is minimal. On a cloth surface, friction is higher due to increased irregularities, so the pencil cell travels a shorter distance. On a sand-covered surface, friction is highest, which quickly slows down and stops the cell, resulting in the shortest distance traveled.",
    "explanation": "Friction opposes the motion of the object. On smoother surfaces, there are fewer surface irregularities, meaning friction is reduced, allowing the pencil cell to maintain its speed longer. On rougher surfaces like cloth or sand, the irregularities cause more interlocking, which increases friction and reduces the distance traveled. The experiment shows how the nature of the surface directly influences frictional forces.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Increasing the normal force, such as when a person sits on a mat or pushes a heavy box with more force, results in higher friction between the contacting surfaces. In the heavy box example, a greater normal force increases the interlocking of surface irregularities, requiring more effort to initiate or maintain movement. Thus, a heavier load or additional downward pressure will increase friction.",
    "explanation": "The frictional force (F) is generally expressed as F = μN, where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. Thus, an increase in N directly increases the frictional force, making it harder to move the object.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One experimental design could involve using an object such as a small box or brick, and altering its surface texture by wrapping it with various materials (polythene, jute, and sandpaper). Similarly, the surface on which it slides could be modified, such as using a smooth tabletop, a cloth-covered table, and a sand-covered table. The experimental steps would include: (1) measuring the static friction force using a spring balance until the object begins to move, (2) recording the distance the object travels on an inclined plane set at a constant angle, and (3) comparing the results across different surface combinations. Controlled variables would include the mass of the object, the angle of the inclined plane, and the area of contact. The independent variables are the types of materials used on the object and the sliding surface, while the dependent variables are the frictional force and distance traveled.",
    "explanation": "This experiment helps in understanding how both surfaces contribute to friction by controlling all other variables and varying only the surface textures. Using a spring balance provides a direct measure of the force required to overcome static friction, while the distance traveled on the inclined plane reflects the combined effects of friction once motion has started.",

    "correct_answer": "Friction plays a dual role in everyday life. It is beneficial because it provides the grip required for walking, driving, and holding objects. For example, car tires rely on friction to maintain traction on the road. On the other hand, friction can be detrimental as it leads to energy loss as heat, resulting in wear and tear of machine parts. An example of its negative impact is the increased energy consumption in engines due to frictional losses, which can lead to overheating and reduced efficiency.",
    "explanation": "The positive aspect of friction lies in its ability to prevent slipping and provide control, which is essential for various mechanical functions and human movements.
