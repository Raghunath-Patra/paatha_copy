    "correct_answer": "Coal is formed from the remains of dense forests that thrived in low-lying wetland areas around 300 million years ago. Flooding and sedimentation buried these forests, and as more layers of soil accumulated, the pressure and temperature increased. Under these conditions, the dead plant material underwent carbonisation, gradually converting into coal—a fossil fuel comprised mainly of carbon.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with the burial of vegetation in swampy regions. The accumulation of sediments leads to increased pressure and temperature, initiating the carbonisation process. Over millions of years, the chemical transformation of plant matter into coal occurs, which explains both its fossil fuel nature and compositional characteristics. This geological and chemical understanding is crucial to appreciating how coal is formed.",

    "correct_answer": "The formation of petroleum begins with the accumulation of dead marine organisms that sink to the bottom of the sea. Over time, these remains are buried by sediments like sand and clay in a process known as sedimentation. Under the cover of these sediments, the organic matter is subjected to increasing pressure and temperature. The absence of oxygen (anoxic conditions) prevents the complete decay of organic materials, allowing them to chemically transform into simpler hydrocarbon compounds. Over millions of years, these compounds mature into petroleum and natural gas, which then get trapped in porous reservoir rocks with a layer of impermeable rock above, forming a natural storage.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Coal is formed from the remains of dense forests that existed about 300 million years ago. Dead plants get buried under soil and sediment, and over millions of years they undergo compression and are subjected to high temperature and pressure. This slow transformation of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonisation.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with the burial of vegetation in swampy conditions. As sediments accumulate, increasing pressure and temperature gradually convert organic matter into coal through carbonisation. This process is a key example of fossil fuel formation that takes millions of years, hence explaining why coal is a non-renewable resource.",

    "correct_answer": "Fossil fuels are exhaustible because they are formed over millions of years from the remains of dead organisms. The rate of formation is extremely slow compared to the rate at which these fuels are being consumed by human activities. In addition, the total reserves are finite and extensive extraction has led to depletion, making them non-renewable resources.",
    "explanation": "The formation of fossil fuels involves the gradual conversion of biological material under high pressure and temperature over geological timescales. Since humans extract and use these fuels much faster than their natural creation, their reserves are limited.
