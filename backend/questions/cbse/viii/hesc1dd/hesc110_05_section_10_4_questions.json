    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The tin-can experiment uses a can with one end covered by a stretched rubber sheet (acting as the eardrum). When sound is directed into the open end of the can, the sound waves travel through the air-filled canal and hit the rubber sheet. This causes the rubber sheet to vibrate similarly to an actual eardrum when sound hits it. The jumping grains on the rubber sheet serve as a visual representation of these vibrations. Thus, the experiment successfully demonstrates how sound waves are converted into mechanical vibrations in the eardrum, a key initial step in the hearing process.",
    "explanation": "This explanation covers the analogy between the experimental setup and the human ear. It clarifies that the vibrating rubber sheet in the experiment stands in for the eardrum, and the visible movement of the grains represents the mechanical vibrations essential for initiating the hearing process.",

    "correct_answer": "Sound waves first enter the outer ear, which is funnel-shaped to help collect and direct them into the ear canal. The sound then travels down the ear canal and strikes the eardrum, a thin, stretched membrane that vibrates in response. These vibrations are transmitted to the inner ear, where they are further processed by tiny sensory structures. Finally, the electrical signals generated from these vibrations are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve, allowing us to perceive sound.",
    "explanation": "The answer details each step of the hearing process: collection of sound by the outer ear, vibration of the eardrum, further transmission and processing in the inner ear, and eventual signal transmission to the brain, thereby linking the experimental model to natural anatomy and function.",

    "correct_answer": "Protecting the ear is crucial because the eardrum is a delicate membrane that plays an essential role in hearing by converting sound waves into vibrations. Inserting sharp or hard objects can damage the eardrum, leading to impaired hearing or complete loss of hearing function. This can negatively affect communication and overall quality of life. Therefore, understanding and maintaining ear safety is critical for preserving auditory health.",
