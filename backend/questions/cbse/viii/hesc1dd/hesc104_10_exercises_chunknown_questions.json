    "correct_answer": "Combustion requires a fuel, oxygen (from air), and heat (to raise the fuel’s temperature to its ignition point).",
    "explanation": "For combustion to occur, three components must be present: a combustible substance (fuel), an oxidising agent (usually oxygen from air), and sufficient heat to raise the fuel to its ignition temperature. This concept is often depicted as the fire triangle.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) Consumption (or depletion) of oxygen, (b) Kerosene, (c) Ignition temperature, (d) Water.",
    "explanation": "When wood or coal burns, it consumes oxygen from the air. Kerosene is a commonly used liquid fuel in homes. A fuel must be heated to its ignition temperature— the minimum temperature needed to start combustion. Lastly, oil fires do not respond to water because water can sink beneath the oil, preventing effective extinguishment.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "CNG burns more cleanly than petrol or diesel because it produces significantly lower emissions of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), sulphur dioxide (SO₂), and particulate matter. This cleaner combustion leads to improved air quality in urban areas.",
    "explanation": "Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is primarily composed of methane, which undergoes more complete combustion compared to conventional fuels. This results in a reduction in harmful emissions, thereby decreasing overall air pollution. Its efficient burning also implies a higher calorific value per unit mass, contributing to better fuel efficiency.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "LPG, a gaseous fuel, burns more efficiently with a higher calorific value and produces a cleaner, controlled flame with minimal smoke and pollutants. In contrast, wood, which is a solid fuel, burns slower and less efficiently, often emitting more smoke and particulate matter, and its use may also lead to deforestation.",
    "explanation": "LPG is stored under pressure and, when used, allows for regulated combustion with better energy output and fewer harmful emissions. Wood, although renewable, tends to burn unevenly, releasing more pollutants and particulate matter. The comparison highlights the efficiency, economic viability, and environmental impact of each fuel type.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Water is a good conductor of electricity, which makes it dangerous for use on electrical fires due to the risk of electrical shock and further short-circuiting. (b) LPG burns more efficiently, produces a cleaner flame with higher calorific value and minimal smoke, making it more suitable for domestic use. (c) An aluminium pipe acts as a heat sink, drawing heat away from the paper and preventing it from reaching its ignition temperature, whereas loose paper heats up quickly and ignites easily.",
    "explanation": "Electrical equipment requires non-conductive methods for fire control, hence water is unsuitable. LPG’s efficient, controlled combustion makes it a preferable domestic fuel over wood, which burns less efficiently and produces more pollutants. Additionally, the thermal conductivity of aluminium dissipates heat, reducing the likelihood of ignition when paper is wrapped around it.",

    "explanation": "This diagram illustrates the temperature gradient and combustion process in a candle flame. The innermost zone is rich in wax vapours that have not yet undergone combustion, the middle zone is where partial combustion occurs producing visible yellow light, and the outer zone, being the hottest, is responsible for complete combustion. Such a diagram helps in understanding practical applications like the use of the outer flame for tasks that require high heat.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "CO₂ extinguishes fires by displacing oxygen around the fuel and by lowering the temperature. Because CO₂ is heavier than air, it forms a blanket over the burning material, cutting off the oxygen supply, while its rapid expansion also cools the fuel below its ignition temperature.",
    "explanation": "Fire requires oxygen to sustain combustion. When CO₂ is used, it covers the fire and pushes away oxygen, thereby starving the flame. In addition, the cooling effect of the expanding gas reduces the temperature of the fuel, ensuring that it remains below the ignition point, which suppresses the ongoing combustion.",

    "correct_answer": "Green leaves contain a high amount of moisture, which absorbs heat and prevents the leaves from reaching the ignition temperature necessary for combustion. Dry leaves, having little to no moisture, heat up quickly and ignite more readily.",
    "explanation": "Water present in green leaves acts as a natural heat sink by absorbing the energy applied, thus lowering the temperature rise within the leaves. Dry leaves, lacking this moisture barrier, are more susceptible to rapid temperature increases, allowing them to reach their ignition point and catch fire.",
