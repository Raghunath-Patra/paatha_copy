    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Changing the physical properties of a vibrating object alters its mass and resonant frequency. In the Jaltrang experiment, adding water to the bowls changes the mass and the effective vibrational characteristics, which results in different pitches. Bowls with less water vibrate faster and produce higher pitches, while bowls with more water vibrate slower, producing lower pitches.",
    "explanation": "Physical modifications such as adding or removing water change the mass and stiffness of the vibrating system. This change influences the natural frequency of vibration. In musical terms, a higher frequency corresponds to a higher pitch, and a lower frequency corresponds to a lower pitch. The Jaltrang clearly shows this relationship through the varying water levels in the bowls.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a metal pan, striking it causes the entire object to vibrate, producing sound; in the case of a rubber band, plucking sets it into rapid oscillatory motion, leading to sound generation; for the metal dish with water, striking the dish causes it to vibrate which in turn creates visible ripples on the water surface, showing the transmission of vibrations. While all three rely on vibrations, the manner of vibration and the medium involved differ.",
    "explanation": "Each experiment demonstrates the general principle that sound is produced by vibrations. The metal pan shows direct mechanical vibration; the rubber band example highlights how tension and elasticity contribute to vibratory motion; and the metal dish with water reveals that vibrations can be transferred to another medium (water) where they become visible. This contrast emphasizes the universality of vibrations in producing sound despite differences in materials and configurations.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment is to use metal spoons, glass jars, and plastic containers. The hypothesis is that each material, because of its unique density and structure, will produce a distinctive pitch when struck. The procedure involves suspending each object so that it can vibrate freely, striking them with a consistent force, and recording the sound using a smartphone app that measures frequency (Hz). Comparing the measured frequencies will show how material properties affect the pitch.",
    "explanation": "The experiment is designed to illustrate how factors such as density, shape, and tension affect vibrational frequency and, thus, the pitch of the sound produced. By controlling the striking force and using a measurable frequency output, students can analyze the relationship between material properties and sound production in a scientifically rigorous way. This also encourages the creation of further investigations into the properties of materials and their acoustic behaviors.",
