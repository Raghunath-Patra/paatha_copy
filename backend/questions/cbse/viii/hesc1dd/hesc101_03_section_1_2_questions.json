    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process of crop production begins with soil preparation, which involves tilling and conditioning the soil to improve its fertility and structure. Next, seeds or seedlings are sown, followed by the application of manure and fertilizers to enrich the soil with essential nutrients. Irrigation is then applied to ensure adequate water supply, which is vital for seed germination and plant growth. Weed control is carried out to prevent competition for nutrients, and finally, the mature crops are harvested and stored properly to maintain their quality until they reach consumers. Each step is interdependent and crucial for enhancing yield, ensuring crop health, and maximizing productivity.",
    "explanation": "Understanding the detailed process helps in managing each stage effectively. Proper soil preparation enhances root growth, timely sowing and fertilizing improve crop vigor, consistent irrigation supports development, diligent weed control reduces losses, and efficient harvesting and storage preserve the crop's quality.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The sequence of crop production practices is critical because each step builds on the previous one. For example, thorough soil preparation creates a robust foundation for seed germination, while timely fertilization and irrigation ensure sustained plant growth. Weed control and timely harvesting further protect and maximize yield. In contrast, home gardening may involve similar steps but usually on a smaller scale, often with more flexible timing and less reliance on mechanized processes. However, the principles remain the same: proper preparation, regular care, and timely interventions lead to a healthy garden. This comparison helps to highlight that, although the scale and methods may differ, the underlying biological and agricultural principles are consistent across large-scale agriculture and home gardening.",
    "explanation": "This answer emphasizes the importance of sequence and timing in crop production. Proper planning and execution in each step can significantly enhance yield, which is a concept that also applies to the more simplified and personal process of home gardening.",

    "correct_answer": "False - Even though artificial irrigation can supply water, paddy requires specific temperature conditions and longer periods of natural rainfall that are typically absent in winter.",
