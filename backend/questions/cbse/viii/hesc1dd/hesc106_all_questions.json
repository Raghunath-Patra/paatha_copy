This reconstructed egg was then implanted into the uterus of a surrogate Scottish blackface ewe. After undergoing normal developmental processes, the cloned sheep, Dolly, was born.

This zygote then begins cell division and later implants in the uterine wall to develop into an embryo.",
    "explanation": "The process starts with ovulation, followed by the movement of sperm towards the egg in the female reproductive system.

    "correct_answer": "Hydra reproduce asexually by budding. When observed closely, students should see small bulges developing on the main body, which gradually increase in size and may eventually detach to become independent hydra.",
    "explanation": "The activity provides an experimental approach to understanding asexual reproduction through budding in hydra. Budding is visible as protrusions on the hydra’s body, which are essentially new individuals developing from the parent. This hands‐on method reinforces theoretical knowledge of asexual reproduction and illustrates variability in bud number and size across specimens.",
