    "correct_answer": "Ensuring campfires are completely extinguished is crucial because any remaining embers or smoldering materials can lead to spontaneous combustion, potentially igniting surrounding vegetation and resulting in forest fires.",
    "explanation": "When campfires are not properly extinguished, residual heat can trigger the self-heating process in nearby dry leaves or wood, sparking a forest fire. This preventive measure is essential for forest safety.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Rapid combustion occurs quickly when an ignition source, such as a flame, initiates the burning process (e.g., gas stove ignition). Spontaneous combustion happens without an obvious external trigger, often due to self-heating in conditions like coal dust accumulation or forest scenarios. An explosion is characterized by a sudden reaction that produces a burst of gas, heat, light, and sound, and can be triggered by an ignition or by applying external pressure as in the case of firecrackers.",
    "explanation": "This answer distinguishes between the three reactions based on their initiation methods and outcomes: rapid combustion needs an external spark, spontaneous combustion arises from internal self-heating of materials, and explosions involve a violent reaction resulting from rapid gas expansion.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed using a controlled setup where crackers are placed in a pressure chamber with adjustable pressure. The procedure would involve incrementally increasing the external pressure applied to the cracker and recording the ignition point and reaction intensity. Safety precautions, such as remote triggering and protective barriers, must be implemented. It is expected that increased pressure could lower the ignition threshold, potentially triggering an explosion even without a traditional ignition source.",
    "explanation": "The experiment requires a systematic approach to vary pressure levels while monitoring the response of the cracker. Detailed observations would help in understanding the relationship between applied pressure and the rate or intensity of the explosive reaction, contributing to safer handling procedures in real-life applications.",

    "correct_answer": "Safety precautions include regular monitoring of coal dust and using appropriate ventilation systems in mines to prevent dust accumulation. In forests, strict measures such as ensuring campfires are fully extinguished, educating the public on fire safety, and monitoring weather conditions can help prevent spontaneous forest fires. Additionally, the removal of flammable debris in both settings reduces risks.",
    "explanation": "By addressing the sources of spontaneous combustion, such as coal dust accumulation and unattended campfires, these precautions mitigate the conditions necessary for a self-heating reaction, thereby preventing potential fires.",
