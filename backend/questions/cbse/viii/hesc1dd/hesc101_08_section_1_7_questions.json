    "correct_answer": "Removing weeds before they produce flowers and seeds is essential because it prevents their reproduction, which in turn reduces their competition with the crop for water, nutrients, space, and light. Timely weeding ensures that the crops receive more resources, promoting better growth and yield.",
    "explanation": "The timing of weed removal is critical for successful crop production. If weeds are allowed to flower and produce seeds, they multiply quickly and continue to compete with the crop. Early removal not only curbs the spread of weeds but also minimizes interference during later stages of crop management, such as harvesting. This process effectively supports better plant growth and higher yield.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Chemical weedicides, when properly diluted and applied, offer the advantage of efficiently covering large areas and quickly reducing weed populations. However, they pose potential risks to human health if protective measures are inadequate, and they may have negative impacts on the environment if they contaminate soil and water. On the other hand, manual weeding is labor-intensive and time-consuming but is generally safer for human health and the environment when compared to chemical methods. It allows for selective removal of weeds without introducing potentially harmful chemicals into the ecosystem.",
    "explanation": "The use of chemical weedicides can lead to faster and more comprehensive weed control, which is particularly valuable in large-scale agriculture. However, their application requires careful handling to avoid health hazards. Manual weeding avoids the use of chemicals but may be impractical for large fields due to the amount of labor required. Thus, both methods have their pros and cons that need to be evaluated based on the specific requirements and constraints of the farming system.",
