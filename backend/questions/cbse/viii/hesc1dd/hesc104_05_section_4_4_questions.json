    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Different materials produce flames of varying colours due to differences in their chemical composition, combustion temperatures, and the completeness of combustion. For instance, a blue flame indicates complete combustion and high temperatures (as seen in LPG or Bunsen burners), while a yellow flame results from incomplete combustion with the presence of incandescent soot particles. A typical reaction for a hydrocarbon fuel might be: CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O + energy. The variations in flame colour occur because different substances emit characteristic wavelengths of light depending on the energy levels involved in their electron transitions.",
    "explanation": "Temperature affects the colour because hotter areas emit light at shorter wavelengths (blue), while cooler regions emit longer wavelengths (yellow, red). Additionally, different elements or compounds contribute to unique spectral lines when excited. Incomplete combustion often produces soot, whose incandescent emission causes yellow hues.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A candle primarily burns a mixture of vaporized wax and air, producing a yellowish flame with incomplete combustion, leading to visible soot. Magnesium, on the other hand, burns with an intense white flame due to rapid oxidation to magnesium oxide (Mg + ½ O2 → MgO) releasing a large amount of energy. Camphor burns with its own characteristic flame, which is also bright and may have variations in colour depending on its sublimation and vaporization before combustion. These differences highlight how chemical composition and physical properties result in distinct combustion behaviours.",
    "explanation": "The chemical structure of the burning substance and the temperature achieved during combustion significantly influence flame colour and brightness. Metals like magnesium undergo exothermic oxidation producing high-temperature flames, whereas organic compounds, such as those in candles and camphor, burn at lower temperatures with incomplete combustion, resulting in different flame characteristics.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed by setting up a controlled environment where small samples of each material are burned individually. The setup should include a heat-resistant surface, appropriate ignition sources, and devices for recording flame colour and temperature, such as a high-speed camera and a thermocouple. Observations should include the flame colour, brightness, and duration. Data can be analyzed by comparing the colour spectra and temperature readings. Safety precautions must include wearing protective eyewear, gloves, using a fire extinguisher, and ensuring proper ventilation to minimize exposure to fumes.",
