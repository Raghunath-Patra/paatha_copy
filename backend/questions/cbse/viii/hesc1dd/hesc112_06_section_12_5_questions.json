    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The formation of a lightning strike begins with the movement of air and water droplets inside a thunderstorm. As warm air rises and water droplets fall, a separation of charges occurs. Positive charges accumulate at the top of the cloud due to the upward motion and charge separation, while negative charges gather at the bottom. This separation creates a large potential difference not only within the cloud but also between the cloud and the ground (where positive charges can be induced). When the electric field becomes strong enough to overcome the insulating properties of air, the air becomes ionized and conducts electricity, leading to a rapid discharge of electricity in the form of lightning, accompanied by sound (thunder).",
    "explanation": "This process involves understanding atmospheric dynamics, charge separation, and the electrical breakdown of the air. It explains the interplay between movement of particles and the resulting electrical phenomena observed as lightning.",

    "correct_answer": "Lightning protection systems are essential for reducing risks to life and property by providing a safe pathway for the electrical discharge during a lightning strike. Such systems generally include lightning rods placed at strategic high points to intercept strikes, conductive cables to channel the electrical energy, and grounding systems to safely dissipate electricity into the earth. In designing a system for a residential building, one must ensure proper placement of lightning rods on the roof and other elevated areas, connect them with low-resistance conductors, and establish a grounding network with sufficient depth and area to dissipate the energy. Regular inspections and maintenance are required to maintain system effectiveness.",
