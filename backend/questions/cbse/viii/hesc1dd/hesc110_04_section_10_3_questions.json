    "type": "Short Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Because the particles in a solid rod are closely packed, allowing vibrations to be transmitted more efficiently and with less loss compared to the more widely spaced particles in air.",
    "explanation": "The efficiency of sound transmission depends on the density and elasticity of the medium. Solids allow faster and clearer transmission since their molecules are more closely arranged.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Vibrating objects create disturbances in the surrounding medium, which propagate as longitudinal waves. In gases, the particles are less densely packed, so sound travels at a moderate speed. In liquids, the particles are closer, allowing sound to travel faster than in gases. In solids, the tightly packed particles enable the quickest transmission of sound. Thus, the speed of sound is lowest in gases, higher in liquids, and highest in solids.",
    "explanation": "The propagation of sound relies on the ability of a medium to transmit vibrational energy. When an object vibrates, it causes adjacent particles to vibrate, creating waves that move through the medium. The density and elasticity of the medium affect the speed of this propagation, which has practical applications in fields ranging from underwater acoustics to engineering.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment involves using a sealed container with a speaker inside and a vacuum pump to control the air pressure. Procedure: First, play a consistent sound with the speaker and record its loudness at normal atmospheric pressure using a decibel meter. Next, gradually evacuate the air from the container, measuring the sound level at each stage. Expected observation: As the air is removed, the sound level drops, eventually reaching a level where sound is not detectable when a near vacuum is achieved. Conclusion: This experiment confirms that sound requires air (or another medium) to propagate.",
    "explanation": "Using controlled variations of air pressure allows us to analyze the relationship between the density of the medium and the transmission of sound.

    "correct_answer": "Understanding how sound travels in different media has several practical applications. For instance, marine animals like whales and dolphins use sound to communicate in water because sound travels faster and over longer distances underwater. In engineering, sound waves are used for structural health monitoring; vibrations in materials can indicate cracks or weaknesses in buildings and bridges. These examples illustrate the importance of knowing how sound behaves in gases, liquids, and solids.",
