    "correct_answer": "Both non-optical and optical aids play vital roles in enhancing the independence of visually impaired persons. Non-optical aids, such as tactile and auditory devices, help in reading, writing, and accessing information through alternative sensory modalities. Optical aids, on the other hand, focus on improving the quality of the remaining vision, for instance through bifocals, contact lenses, and telescopic aids that enlarge objects. Together, they provide a comprehensive support system where optical aids address visual clarity and non-optical aids compensate for other sensory limitations.",
    "explanation": "By using both sets of aids, visually impaired individuals can better adapt to educational, professional, and daily life challenges. Optical aids enhance visual input while non-optical aids turn other senses into reliable channels for information, making a balanced approach key to independence.",
