    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Puberty in girls is initiated when the ovaries begin to produce estrogen, a hormone that triggers the development of secondary sexual characteristics. The increase in estrogen leads to breast development, including the formation of milk-secreting mammary glands. Along with breast growth, hair begins to appear under the arms and in the pubic region. The release of estrogen is regulated by the pituitary gland, which secretes hormones that signal the ovaries to produce estrogen. This coordinated hormonal interplay results in the overall physical transformation observed during female puberty.",
    "explanation": "The process is a complex interaction where the pituitary gland stimulates the ovaries through specific hormones (like FSH and LH) to produce estrogen. This hormone then influences the development of breasts and the distribution of body hair. These changes are crucial for marking the transition from childhood to adulthood.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In boys, puberty is marked by an increase in testosterone production from the testes, which leads to the development of facial hair, chest hair, and other male secondary sexual characters. In girls, the ovaries begin to produce estrogen, which is responsible for breast development and the formation of mammary glands, along with the appearance of body hair in specific regions. Although both sexes experience an increase in hormone levels due to signals from the pituitary gland, the types of hormones and their effects differ, resulting in the distinct physical changes characteristic of each gender.",
    "explanation": "The pituitary gland plays a central role in both sexes by releasing hormones that stimulate the gonads. However, the gonads respond by producing different hormones—testosterone in boys and estrogen in girls—which then drive the development of gender-specific secondary sexual traits. This differentiation highlights the tailored actions of hormones in sexual development.",

    "correct_answer": "False. The testes and ovaries produce gametes and secrete hormones; however, the development of secondary sexual characters is induced by these hormones rather than being directly produced by the reproductive organs.",
