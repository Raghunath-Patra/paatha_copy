    "correct_answer": "Cornea – because it is the transparent outer layer that allows light to enter and is essential for focusing images onto the retina.",
    "explanation": "The cornea is the clear, outer coat of the eye through which light passes before being focused onto the retina. Its transparency and curved shape are key to refracting light correctly.",

    "correct_answer": "Controlling the size of the pupil – as it adjusts the pupil's diameter to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.",
    "explanation": "The iris contains muscles that either constrict or dilate the pupil, thereby controlling the quantity of light that reaches the retina. This is essential for vision under varying lighting conditions.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Lens; it is thicker at the center – the lens focuses light on the retina and its thicker central region helps in converging light rays more precisely.",
    "explanation": "The lens of the eye is responsible for focusing light. Unlike a uniformly thick lens, the human eye's lens is thicker in the center, which allows it to refract light more effectively onto the retina for clear vision.",

    "correct_answer": "The blind spot is an area on the retina where the optic nerve exits the eye; it has no photoreceptor cells, so images that fall on this spot cannot be seen.",
    "explanation": "Because there are no rods or cones in the region where the optic nerve connects to the retina, no visual information is received from that point. This explains why a small area in our field of vision is 'blind.'",

    "explanation": "This mechanism protects the retina from excessive light that could cause damage in bright conditions and enhances vision in low light by increasing the light intake through a larger pupil opening.",

    "explanation": "With aging or due to other factors, the lens may become opaque, leading to cataracts. The surgical removal of the opaque lens followed by the insertion of a clear, artificial lens is a well-established procedure that significantly improves vision.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Persistence of vision is the phenomenon where the image of an object remains on the retina for about 1/16th of a second after the object is removed. This allows a series of rapidly displayed still images (at a rate faster than 16 per second) to be perceived as a continuous moving picture, which is the principle behind motion pictures.",
    "explanation": "When still images are flashed quickly in sequence—such as the 24 frames per second in movies—the short-term persistence of each image blends with the next. The brain interprets this sequence as fluid motion, thus creating the illusion of continuous movement.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Rods are highly sensitive to light and are primarily responsible for vision in dim light, but they do not detect color, leading to monochrome vision in low-light conditions. Cones, on the other hand, require brighter light to function but allow us to see color and fine detail. This division of labor enables the human visual system to adapt to a wide range of lighting conditions, ensuring effective vision during both day and night.",
    "explanation": "The rods and cones work together: rods provide the necessary sensitivity for night vision, while cones produce the detailed and colorful images in daylight. This complementary functioning means that our eyes can adjust to differing environments—using cones in bright conditions and relying on rods under low light—thus maximizing the visual information processed by the brain.",
