As the ovum matures, one is released approximately every 28 to 30 days (ovulation). Concurrently, the uterine wall thickens, preparing to receive a fertilised egg.

In contrast, males become capable of reproduction at puberty with the production of sperm, and this ability generally continues for a longer period into later life.

This scientific fact debunks the myth that the mother can influence the sex of her baby, shifting the focus away from outdated cultural beliefs.",
    "explanation": "By recognizing that the egg’s genetic material is constant (always X) and that only the sperm carries the variable sex-determining chromosome, the misconception that the mother influences the baby’s sex is scientifically disproven.

In boys, this includes an increase in muscle mass, deepening of the voice, growth of facial and body hair, and enlargement of the testes, which contribute to the body's ability to produce sperm. In girls, puberty brings about breast development, widening of the hips, and the initiation of menstrual cycles, preparing the body for potential pregnancy. These changes are collectively known as secondary sexual characteristics, which signal that both sexes have reached a level of maturity enabling reproduction.",
    "explanation": "This complex process is regulated by hormones such as testosterone in boys and estrogen in girls.
