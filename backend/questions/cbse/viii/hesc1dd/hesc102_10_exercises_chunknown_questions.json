    "correct_answer": "The expected explanation is that fermentation in test tube B produces carbon dioxide, which inflates the balloon. When the carbon dioxide is directed into the lime water, it reacts with calcium hydroxide to form calcium carbonate, turning the solution milky. This demonstrates the production of CO₂ during yeast fermentation.",
    "explanation": "This project integrates experimental procedure with chemical reaction observation. The reaction of carbon dioxide with lime water (Ca(OH)₂) produces calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), which is insoluble and appears as a milky precipitate.
