    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Cow dung has a relatively low calorific value (6000-8000 kJ/kg), wood has a moderate value (17000-22000 kJ/kg), and LPG has a high calorific value (55000 kJ/kg). When boiling water, fuels with higher calorific values, like LPG, will produce more heat energy per kilogram of fuel, making them more efficient for heating. Therefore, LPG would be preferred for boiling water because it requires less fuel to produce the same amount of heat, thereby saving cost and reducing fuel consumption.",
    "explanation": "The answer involves comparing the energy output per kilogram of different fuels and applying that understanding to a practical scenario. LPG’s efficiency in delivering higher heat energy makes it a cost-effective and efficient choice for tasks like boiling water.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Fuel combustion, especially from coal, diesel, and petrol, releases pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). In the atmosphere, these gases react with water vapor to form sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric acid (HNO₃), which combine with rainwater to produce acid rain. Acid rain can severely damage crops by altering soil pH, corroding buildings and monuments, and degrading water quality in ecosystems. The cumulative impact can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, damage to cultural heritage, and long-term ecological imbalance.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment would be to use identical setups to boil a fixed volume of water (for example, 1 liter) using two different fuels (e.g., wood and LPG). The procedure would include: measuring the exact amount of each fuel before combustion, setting up identical containers and ignition sources, and recording the time taken to reach boiling point. Controlled variables would include the initial water temperature, ambient conditions, pot dimensions, and mass of water. The key measurement would be the amount of fuel (in grams or kilograms) consumed to bring the water to boil. From this, the energy efficiency can be deduced by comparing the energy produced per unit mass of fuel. Additional measurements could include the temperature change over time, to calculate the heat delivered to the water.",
