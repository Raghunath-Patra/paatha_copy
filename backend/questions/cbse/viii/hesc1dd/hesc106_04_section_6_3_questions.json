    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Binary fission in Amoeba starts with a single parent cell where the nucleus undergoes duplication and divides into two nuclei. Following the nuclear division, the cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis), eventually leading to the formation of two daughter Amoebae. Each daughter cell receives one copy of the nucleus, ensuring that the genetic material is fully replicated and proportionately distributed.",
    "explanation": "This process is critical in unicellular organisms such as Amoeba, where efficiency and speed in reproduction are advantageous for survival. The division of the nucleus ensures that each new cell is genetically identical to the parent, while the division of the cytoplasm completes the separation.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both budding in Hydra and binary fission in Amoeba are forms of asexual reproduction that result in offspring genetically identical to the parent. In budding, a new individual develops as an outgrowth of the parent body and eventually detaches, while in binary fission, the parent cell divides into two daughter cells after the nucleus has duplicated. The main difference lies in the mechanism: budding involves localized growth from a specific part of the parent, whereas binary fission involves a complete division of the cell into two separate organisms.",
    "explanation": "These differences highlight the adaptability of asexual reproduction methods across species. Budding allows for continual partial regeneration and growth, while binary fission offers a swift method for single-celled organisms to rapidly multiply under favorable conditions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The cloning process for Dolly involved several key steps: first, a mammary gland cell was taken from a Finn Dorsett sheep, which served as the donor of the nucleus. Simultaneously, an egg cell was collected from a Scottish blackface ewe. The nucleus of the egg cell was removed, and the donor nucleus was inserted into the enucleated egg. This reconstructed egg was then implanted into the uterus of a surrogate Scottish blackface ewe. After undergoing normal developmental processes, the cloned sheep, Dolly, was born. This process is significant because it highlighted the possibility of reprogramming a differentiated cell to develop into a complete organism. However, cloning continues to face challenges such as high failure rates, developmental abnormalities, and ethical concerns regarding the welfare of cloned animals.",
    "explanation": "Cloning demonstrates the potential to replicate an entire organism from a single cell, showcasing the power of nuclear transfer technology. The process not only challenges our understanding of developmental biology but also raises important questions about genetic diversity, animal health, and bioethics.",
