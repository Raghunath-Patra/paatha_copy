    "correct_answer": "a: relative motion; b: nature or roughness; c: heat; d: reduces; e: less",
    "explanation": "Friction opposes the relative motion between contacting surfaces, which depends on the nature or roughness of the surfaces. When surfaces rub against each other, friction produces heat. Sprinkling powder on a carrom board reduces the friction between the board and the striker, and once an object is in motion, sliding friction is typically less than static friction because the micro-contacts have less time to form strong bonds.",

    "correct_answer": "static, sliding, rolling",
    "explanation": "Static friction is the force that must be overcome to initiate motion and is generally greater than the sliding friction encountered once an object is moving. Rolling friction is even lower compared to sliding friction due to the reduced contact area and the nature of rolling motion. Therefore, the decreasing order is: static > sliding > rolling.",

    "explanation": "A wet marble floor provides a lubricated, smoother surface that minimizes friction. The dry marble floor, though smooth, has a higher friction force than its wet counterpart. Among the two rough surfaces, the towel generally has a texture that produces more friction than marble but may be lower than that of newspaper if the newspaper surface is crinkled or uneven.

    "correct_answer": "Sliding friction is less than static friction because, when an object is stationary, the microscopic surface irregularities have sufficient time to interlock firmly, creating strong resistance to the initiation of motion. Once the object is in motion, these contacts have less time to form, and many of the interlocking points break, resulting in reduced frictional force.",
    "explanation": "Static friction must be overcome to initiate motion due to complete interlocking of microscopic irregularities between surfaces. When the object starts sliding, the continuous breaking and reforming of these contacts—and the reduced time for interlocking—leads to lower frictional forces. This difference explains why initiating motion is more difficult than maintaining it.",

    "explanation": "Friction is beneficial because it provides grip and traction which are necessary for everyday activities such as walking, writing, or driving safely.

    "explanation": "When an object moves through a fluid (which includes gases and liquids), it experiences a frictional force known as drag that depends on its shape, speed, and the nature of the fluid.

The observations should detail how friction supports activities like acceleration, deceleration, and stability, while also sometimes opposing motion.",

A list of ten such specific scenarios should be provided.",

    "correct_answer": "As the toy is suspended, it initially falls due to gravity. When the thread is tightened, the increased tension alters the configuration and may increase the contact forces between moving parts, resulting in a change in the frictional forces acting on the system. The observation may include a slowing down or stabilization of the motion due to the enhanced friction created by the new configuration. The explanation should detail how friction plays a role in energy dissipation in the system.",
    "explanation": "This activity involves understanding how friction can be manipulated by altering contact forces within a system. When the thread is tightened, it not only changes the potential energy but also how the various parts – such as the matchbox tray and pen refill assembly – interact. The interlocking surface irregularities result in an increased resistance to motion (friction), thereby reducing the speed or halting the descent.

Similarly, the surface on which it slides could be modified, such as using a smooth tabletop, a cloth-covered table, and a sand-covered table. The experimental steps would include: (1) measuring the static friction force using a spring balance until the object begins to move, (2) recording the distance the object travels on an inclined plane set at a constant angle, and (3) comparing the results across different surface combinations.

    "correct_answer": "Friction plays a dual role in everyday life. It is beneficial because it provides the grip required for walking, driving, and holding objects. For example, car tires rely on friction to maintain traction on the road. On the other hand, friction can be detrimental as it leads to energy loss as heat, resulting in wear and tear of machine parts. An example of its negative impact is the increased energy consumption in engines due to frictional losses, which can lead to overheating and reduced efficiency.",
    "explanation": "The positive aspect of friction lies in its ability to prevent slipping and provide control, which is essential for various mechanical functions and human movements.

    "correct_answer": "The friction between two surfaces depends on factors such as surface roughness and the materials involved.

    "correct_answer": "Friction acts opposite to the applied force because it is the reactive force that arises at the interface of two surfaces in contact. For an object in motion to slow down and eventually stop, the net force acting on it must be zero or negative relative to its motion. Friction provides this counteracting force, ensuring that the applied force is offset by an opposing force so that the object decelerates.",
    "explanation": "When forces are applied, the net force determines the acceleration. In the presence of friction opposing the applied force, the net force is either reduced or becomes negative, thereby decelerating the object.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's First Law states that an object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Friction is a key external force that is often not immediately visible but acts continuously between surfaces in contact. Even after the initial push, friction opposes the object's motion, reducing its speed until it eventually stops. This behavior demonstrates the concept of inertia as explained by Newton's First Law, showing that without a balancing force like friction, the motion would persist.",
    "explanation": "Newton's First Law, sometimes called the law of inertia, requires an external force to change the state of motion. Friction is that external force that eventually stops objects, reinforcing the idea that motion cannot continue indefinitely in the presence of friction.",

    "correct_answer": "An ideal experiment would involve using a flat object (like a book) and several different surfaces with varying known roughness (e.g., smooth glass, rough sandpaper, polished wood). Materials include a consistent weight object, surfaces with different textures, a measuring tape, and a timer. The procedure is as follows: (1) Place the book on each surface, (2) Give it a consistent initial push, (3) Measure the distance traveled until it stops for each surface. Independent variable: surface roughness; dependent variable: distance the book travels; controlled variables: weight of the book, push force, and environmental conditions. The expected outcome is that on rougher surfaces, the book will travel a shorter distance due to a higher frictional force, while on smoother surfaces, it will travel further.",
