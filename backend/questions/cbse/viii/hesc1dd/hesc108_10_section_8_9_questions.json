    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Water pressure in a container acts both vertically and laterally. In Activity 8.8, as water is poured into the tube, the increased height of the water column increases the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom, causing the rubber sheet to bulge outward. In Activity 8.10, equal pressure at the same depth is demonstrated by the water streams emerging from holes at the same horizontal distance. This shows that pressure at any point within a fluid is isotropic, meaning it acts equally in all directions.",
    "explanation": "Pressure in a fluid is given by P = ρgh, showing that the pressure increases with the height (h) of the water column. The experiments illustrate that at greater depths, higher pressure causes more pronounced effects on the boundaries of the container (e.g., the rubber sheet bulging). Furthermore, the isotropic nature of pressure is confirmed when water streams from holes at the same depth behave similarly, regardless of their orientation.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Liquids exert pressure on their container walls because of the weight of the liquid above any given point, and this pressure is transmitted in all directions. This is observed in experiments where increased liquid height results in greater pressure, as seen by the bulging rubber sheets in Activities 8.8 and 8.9. In contrast, gases also exert pressure on container walls due to the constant motion and collisions of their molecules with the container's surfaces. However, gases are highly compressible, and their pressure can vary with temperature and volume according to the ideal gas law (PV = nRT).",
    "explanation": "In liquids, the hydrostatic pressure increases with depth due to gravitational force and is calculated by P = ρgh. The experiments show that the increased depth of water leads to more pressure at the bottom and sides of the container. Gases similarly exert pressure when their molecules collide with container walls, but their pressure is influenced by additional factors such as temperature, making the behavior somewhat different from that of liquids. This comparison demonstrates fundamental differences in how fluids and gases behave under pressure.",

    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed by taking a transparent cylindrical container, drilling several equally sized holes at the same height around its sides, and then filling the container with liquid. The procedure includes measuring the distance that water streams from each hole travel horizontally. The expected observation is that all water streams exit with similar force, landing at the same horizontal distance, thus verifying that pressure is isotropic for a given liquid depth.",
    "explanation": "This experiment builds on the concept that fluid pressure acts equally in all directions at a given depth. By using a controlled setup where the holes are at the same depth, any variation in the water streams would indicate errors in the setup or other factors. Consistent results across all holes support the hypothesis that liquid pressure is uniform at a particular depth, aligning with the principle of hydrostatic pressure.",
