    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The nitrogen cycle begins with atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) which can be converted to nitrogenous compounds through processes such as lightning fixation and bacterial nitrogen fixation (by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and blue-green algae). Once converted, these compounds are present in the soil and are taken up by plants through their roots. Animals that feed on these plants obtain nitrogen through consumption. When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi decompose the organic matter, converting it back into nitrogenous compounds. Finally, through the process of denitrification, certain bacteria convert these compounds back into gaseous nitrogen (N₂), which is released into the atmosphere, thus keeping the total atmospheric nitrogen concentration relatively constant.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Nitrogen fixation is critical for converting inert atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into reactive nitrogenous compounds, such as ammonia, which can then be assimilated by plants. This process is carried out by specific bacteria and blue-green algae, which live in the soil and in symbiotic relationships with plants. Without nitrogen fixation, plants would not be able to access the nitrogen necessary for synthesizing vital molecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. Consequently, the entire food chain would be affected due to the shortage of accessible nitrogen, leading to reduced growth and productivity in ecosystems. The process also helps maintain the equilibrium of atmospheric nitrogen by eventually balancing nitrogen uptake with its return via denitrification.",
