    "correct_answer": "Lightning causes the nitrogen in the air to react with oxygen, forming nitrogen oxides that eventually produce nitrates. However, this process is not sufficient to account for the overall constant level of atmospheric nitrogen because the majority of nitrogen fixation is carried out biologically by bacteria in soil and plant root nodules.",
    "explanation": "Lightning provides energy that breaks the strong N≡N bond, allowing nitrogen to combine with oxygen to form compounds like NO and NO2, which then react to form nitrates.

Without nitrogen fixation, plants would not be able to access the nitrogen necessary for synthesizing vital molecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.
