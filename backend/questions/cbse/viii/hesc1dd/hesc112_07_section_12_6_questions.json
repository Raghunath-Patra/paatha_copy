    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In an open field during a lightning storm, you should immediately move away from any tall objects or trees and find a low spot, then squat low on the ground with your head between your knees and your hands on your knees. This minimizes your height and reduces your target area for a lightning strike. Avoid lying flat on the ground as it increases the surface area, and avoid touching metal objects such as poles or fences. Each step is crucial to reduce the likelihood of being directly struck by lightning.",
    "explanation": "By minimizing your height and reducing your contact with potentially conductive objects, you lessen the probability of lightning making a connection with your body. Squatting reduces your body’s exposure, making it a safer position in the absence of proper shelter.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Indoors, one should avoid contact with telephone cords, electrical wires, and metal pipes because these can conduct the electrical charge from lightning. It is safer to use mobile or cordless phones and to unplug electrical appliances such as computers and TVs, though keeping electrical lights on is acceptable as they do not pose a risk. Additionally, avoid bathing to prevent contact with running water, and stay away from wired systems. These precautions reduce the chance of electrical conduction that could lead to electrocution or fires.",
    "explanation": "The rationale is based on the principle that electricity travels through conductive materials. By minimizing contact with such materials, you significantly lower the risk of letting lightning’s electrical energy reach you. This creates a safer indoor environment during a thunderstorm.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Lightning conductors are highly effective in protecting buildings from the destructive effects of lightning. Their design involves a metallic rod that is taller than the building, with its upper end exposed to the air and the lower end buried deep in the ground. This configuration takes advantage of the principles of electrical conductivity and the path of least resistance, providing a preferential route for the lightning’s electrical charge to safely dissipate into the earth. Additionally, elements such as metal columns, electrical wires, and water pipes, though secondary, also contribute to protection when not touched. Overall, the design minimizes potential damage to structural and electrical systems.",
    "explanation": "The efficacy of lightning conductors is grounded in their ability to channel high-voltage electrical energy directly to the ground, bypassing more vulnerable parts of a building. Their installation is based on fundamental principles of electricity, ensuring that any incoming charge follows the designated safe pathway rather than causing harm.",
