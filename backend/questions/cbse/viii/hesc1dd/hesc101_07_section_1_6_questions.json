    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Traditional irrigation systems, such as the moat, chain pump, dhekli, and rahat, often involve human or animal labor, making them cheaper in terms of initial cost but less efficient due to labor intensity and lower water delivery precision. Modern irrigation systems like sprinkler and drip systems use pumps powered by diesel, biogas, electricity, or solar energy. They are more efficient in terms of water usage and can be automated but require higher initial investment and maintenance costs.",
    "explanation": "The answer should discuss that traditional methods are cost-effective and accessible, especially in regions with low technological availability, but they frequently lead to higher water wastage and irregular watering. Meanwhile, modern systems not only save water through precise application (drip systems) but also use techniques suited for irregular terrains (sprinkler systems), enhancing crop yield even though they have higher financial and energy inputs.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The sprinkler system consists of a network of perpendicular pipes fitted with rotating nozzles attached to the main pipeline. Water is pumped under pressure through these pipes, causing it to spray out in a pattern similar to rainfall. This system is especially useful on uneven land where water availability is limited, as the pressure-driven sprinkling helps achieve even distribution, making it ideal for lawns, coffee plantations, and similar crops.",
    "explanation": "The detailed explanation should include that because water is released uniformly over the crop area, sprinkler systems maximize coverage even on irregular terrains. Also, the rotation of nozzles ensures that the water is evenly applied, which is efficient for crops that require consistent watering without waterlogging any particular section.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In summer, irrigation frequency is increased due to the higher rate of evaporation, which causes the moisture in the soil and on the leaves to evaporate more quickly. This leads to rapid drying of the soil, which can hamper seed germination, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. Regular irrigation compensates for this loss of moisture, ensuring that the plants receive adequate water to support growth, nutrient transport, and protection against extreme heat.",
    "explanation": "A strong evaluation should mention that the rapid evaporation in summer not only reduces available soil moisture but may also stress plants due to heat. This increase in irrigation frequency is a direct response to maintain sufficient water levels in the root zone, which is critical for maintaining the physiological processes of the plant such as nutrient absorption and transpiration regulation.",

    "correct_answer": "False. Even in regions with good monsoon rains, proper irrigation practices are often needed to supplement rainfall, ensure even distribution, and protect crops from fluctuations in moisture levels.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Water is essential for seed germination because it activates enzymes that aid in the process of the seed's growth and initiates metabolic activities. It also softens the seed coat to enable microbial activity and nutrient absorption. Furthermore, water acts as a solvent for nutrients, enabling their transport throughout the plant, and regulates temperature by protecting crops from frost and excessive heat. Thus, water helps in maintaining physiological balance and supports overall plant development.",
    "explanation": "An effective answer should detail that without water, seeds cannot break dormancy and metabolize stored food. Additionally, water is vital for dissolving and transporting nutrients via the xylem, while the physical presence of water in plant tissues provides thermal regulation, ensuring optimal conditions for growth and protection against environmental stresses.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One can design the experiment by selecting two similar plots with the same soil type and crop. The independent variable would be the type of irrigation system (drip vs. sprinkler). The dependent variables would be water usage (measured in liters per square meter) and plant growth parameters (height, number of leaves, yield). Controls would include using the same crop variety, identical fertilizer and management practices, and measuring environmental conditions like temperature and sunlight. The expected outcome is that the drip irrigation plot would use less water while maintaining or enhancing plant growth compared to the sprinkler system due to reduced evaporation losses and direct water delivery to the roots.",
    "explanation": "The design must specify how to set up control and experimental groups, how to measure water consumption accurately, and indicators for plant growth. The explanation highlights that drip irrigation reduces evaporative losses by directly targeting roots and can thereby be more water-efficient.",
