    "explanation": "Physical modifications such as adding or removing water change the mass and stiffness of the vibrating system. This change influences the natural frequency of vibration.

While all three rely on vibrations, the manner of vibration and the medium involved differ.",
    "explanation": "Each experiment demonstrates the general principle that sound is produced by vibrations. The metal pan shows direct mechanical vibration; the rubber band example highlights how tension and elasticity contribute to vibratory motion; and the metal dish with water reveals that vibrations can be transferred to another medium (water) where they become visible.

In gases, the particles are less densely packed, so sound travels at a moderate speed. In liquids, the particles are closer, allowing sound to travel faster than in gases. In solids, the tightly packed particles enable the quickest transmission of sound. Thus, the speed of sound is lowest in gases, higher in liquids, and highest in solids.",

    "explanation": "The larynx plays a crucial role in voice production. The diagram of the larynx typically shows a cartilaginous structure with the vocal cords stretched inside.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Varying the tension in the vocal cords directly affects the pitch and quality of the produced sound. When the vocal cords are stretched tight and made thin, they vibrate faster as air is passed through, which results in a higher-pitched sound. Conversely, when they are relaxed and thicker, the vibration rate slows, leading to a lower-pitched sound. The muscles attached to the cords control these changes in tension, allowing us to modulate our voice when speaking or singing. For example, in the demonstration activity using rubber strips, tightening the strips produces a higher sound, much like tightening the vocal cords results in a higher pitch.",
    "explanation": "The quality of sound produced by the vocal cords is reliant on the speed and nature of their vibrations.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiments using rubber strips and paper with a narrow slit offer a tangible model for how the human vocal cords work. In both experiments, flexible materials are held under tension and a narrow gap is created through which air passes. When air is blown through these gaps, the flexible materials vibrate to produce sound. This behavior closely mirrors what happens in the human larynx: the vocal cords are held in place under tension, and as the lungs force air through the narrow opening between them, the cords vibrate to create sound. The adjustment of tension in the materials—whether by stretching or by altering the slit size—parallels how muscles adjust the tension in the vocal cords, thereby altering the pitch and quality of the produced sound.",

    "correct_answer": "The tin-can experiment uses a can with one end covered by a stretched rubber sheet (acting as the eardrum). When sound is directed into the open end of the can, the sound waves travel through the air-filled canal and hit the rubber sheet. This causes the rubber sheet to vibrate similarly to an actual eardrum when sound hits it. The jumping grains on the rubber sheet serve as a visual representation of these vibrations. Thus, the experiment successfully demonstrates how sound waves are converted into mechanical vibrations in the eardrum, a key initial step in the hearing process.",
    "explanation": "This explanation covers the analogy between the experimental setup and the human ear. It clarifies that the vibrating rubber sheet in the experiment stands in for the eardrum, and the visible movement of the grains represents the mechanical vibrations essential for initiating the hearing process.",

    "correct_answer": "Sound waves first enter the outer ear, which is funnel-shaped to help collect and direct them into the ear canal. The sound then travels down the ear canal and strikes the eardrum, a thin, stretched membrane that vibrates in response. These vibrations are transmitted to the inner ear, where they are further processed by tiny sensory structures. Finally, the electrical signals generated from these vibrations are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve, allowing us to perceive sound.",
