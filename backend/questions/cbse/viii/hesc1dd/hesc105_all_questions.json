This process can be carried out by human initiatives or can occur naturally when areas are left undisturbed. The significance of reforestation lies in its ability to restore habitats, stabilize soils, regulate water cycles, and mitigate climate change by absorbing CO₂. Natural reforestation complements human efforts by allowing indigenous flora to reestablish and create a balanced ecosystem.",
    "explanation": "The process starts with selecting appropriate tree species, preparing the land, and then planting and caring for the trees.

    "correct_answer": "Deforestation affects the water cycle in multiple ways: it reduces transpiration from trees which ordinarily contributes moisture to the atmosphere, thereby reducing rainfall and increasing the likelihood of droughts. At the same time, fewer trees mean less interception of rainfall and protection against soil erosion, so water runs off the land more quickly, which can result in floods.",
    "explanation": "Trees play a critical role in the water cycle through transpiration. With reduced tree cover, less water is recycled into the atmosphere, leading to lower rainfall.

    "correct_answer": "Deforestation reduces the number of trees available to absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) during photosynthesis. The basic chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. With fewer trees, more CO₂ remains in the atmosphere. Since CO₂ is a potent greenhouse gas, it traps infrared radiation which increases the Earth's surface temperature. This enhancement of the greenhouse effect is a core factor in global warming.",
    "explanation": "The reduction in photosynthetic capacity due to fewer trees means that excess CO₂ accumulates. In the atmosphere, CO₂ absorbs and re-emits infrared energy, trapping heat that would otherwise escape into space.
