    "correct_answer": "Encroachment by local communities can lead to the destruction of natural vegetation, reduction of animal habitats, and increased human-wildlife conflict. It often results in fragmentation of ecosystems, making it difficult for wildlife to migrate, find food, or breed effectively, which ultimately threatens the overall health and balance of the ecosystem.",
    "explanation": "The explanation should detail the cascade of negative effects: habitat loss, altered ecological balance, increased stress on wildlife, and disruption of natural processes.

    "correct_answer": "Wildlife sanctuaries provide natural habitats that encourage breeding, natural behavior, and ecological interactions essential for the survival of endangered species. They serve as refuges from poaching and habitat destruction. However, challenges include encroachment by local communities, limited funding, human-animal conflicts, and balancing the needs of local populations with conservation goals.",

    "correct_answer": "In-situ conservation refers to the protection and conservation of species in their natural habitats, as seen in wildlife sanctuaries where animals live in an ecosystem similar to their natural one. Ex-situ conservation involves safeguarding endangered species through facilities like zoos, where animals are kept in controlled, artificial environments for breeding and public education. While in-situ conservation supports natural evolutionary processes and ecosystem services, ex-situ conservation provides a backup against extinction by allowing detailed monitoring and intervention for breeding and research purposes.",
    "explanation": "This answer should outline the benefits and limitations of both conservation methods. Students are expected to analyze how in-situ conservation maintains ecological balance and how ex-situ conservation, although artificial, plays a critical role in saving species from extinction when their natural habitats are highly threatened.",
