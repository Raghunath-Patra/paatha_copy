    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Visually impaired individuals first learn to recognize individual letters through touch, gradually progressing to special characters and common word combinations. This learning process requires repeated tactile exposure and memorization of the unique dot patterns in each cell, enabling learners to eventually read smoothly.",
    "explanation": "The process of learning Braille is highly dependent on tactile training and repetition. Students begin with simple letter patterns, work on combinations and familiar words, and utilize muscle/memory retention. This hands-on method underscores the importance of practice in mastering a non-visual form of reading.",
