    "correct_answer": "The observations in Table 8.2 indicate that when force is applied to objects like dough, springs, rubber bands, or scales that are fixed in place, the object’s shape changes (deformation occurs), but there is no change in its state of motion. This leads to the general conclusion that the application of force may change the shape of an object even if it does not move.",
    "explanation": "The table clearly shows that although the objects do not experience movement (since they are fixed or supported), their shapes are altered when force is applied. This supports the principle that force is responsible for both deformation and, when applicable, changes in motion.",

    "explanation": "Each of these effects is a demonstration of the diverse outcomes when force is applied.

    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment involves using a small rubber ball placed on a smooth surface. Set up a ramp where the ball can both roll and experience deformation upon hitting a cushioned barrier. Procedure: (1) Roll the ball down the ramp at a controlled speed; (2) Allow the ball to hit a cushioned wall that can absorb impact and record how the ball deforms upon impact; (3) Observe the changes in the ball's speed, direction, and shape before and after the collision. Expected observations: The ball will change its motion (speed and possibly direction) and will experience a temporary change in shape (deformation) due to the impact force. Conclusions: The experiment shows that force can introduce both a change in the motion of the ball and a temporary change in its shape.",
