    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "If the electrodes are interchanged, the plate that was previously the cathode (receiving copper deposition) becomes the anode and will start to dissolve, while the new cathode (formerly the anode) will receive the deposited copper. This reversal in roles will result in a copper coating on the plate now connected to the negative terminal and dissolution of the copper from the plate connected to the positive terminal.",
    "explanation": "Interchanging the electrodes reverses the roles of deposition and dissolution due to the change in electrical polarity. The process demonstrates the importance of electrode placement in achieving the desired electroplating outcome.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electroplating is used because it allows for a thin, functional, and decorative coating of an expensive or desirable metal (like chromium, silver, or gold) over a base metal. This method is cost-effective as it combines the strength and lower cost of base metals with the desirable properties of the plated metal without the expense of using the extensive amounts of the noble metal.",
    "explanation": "The process minimizes costs while enhancing surface properties such as resistance to corrosion, shine, and scratch-resistance. It is particularly useful for applications that require the appearance or specific characteristics of a high-value metal without incurring exorbitant material costs.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Electroplating occurs when an electric current is passed through an electrolyte containing dissolved metal ions—in this case, copper sulphate in water. At the cathode (negative electrode), copper ions (Cu²⁺) are attracted and gain electrons (reduction) to form solid copper (Cu), which deposits onto the electrode. The reaction at the cathode is: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). At the anode (positive electrode), the solid copper metal loses electrons (oxidation) and forms copper ions, thus dissolving into the solution. The reaction at the anode is: Cu(s) → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻. This continuous process results in the deposition of copper on the cathode while maintaining a constant concentration of copper ions in the solution as copper from the anode is replenished.",
    "explanation": "This explanation covers the electrochemical reactions at both electrodes. The cathode reduction builds up a coating of copper, while the anode oxidation replenishes the copper ions, making the process sustainable during continuous operation.",

    "correct_answer": "The disposal of used conducting solutions from electroplating processes is a major environmental concern because these solutions often contain heavy metals like copper, chromium, or zinc, as well as acidic components that can contaminate water bodies and soil. These pollutants can cause harm to aquatic life and pose risks to human health if they enter the food chain. Effective management strategies include recycling and reconditioning the solutions, using advanced treatment methods such as precipitation, ion exchange, and membrane filtration to remove toxic metals, and ensuring proper disposal through regulated hazardous waste management practices. Adhering to environmental guidelines and regulations is essential to minimize the environmental impact.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the electroplating process, the cathode and anode serve complementary yet opposite roles. The cathode is connected to the negative terminal of the battery. At the cathode, copper ions (Cu²⁺) in the solution gain electrons (reduction) to form solid copper, which deposits on the cathode's surface. The reaction is: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). Conversely, the anode is connected to the positive terminal and is made of copper in this experiment. Here, copper metal loses electrons (oxidation) and transforms into copper ions that enter the solution, a process represented by: Cu(s) → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻. The dissolution of copper at the anode replenishes the copper ions that are being reduced at the cathode, ensuring a sustainable deposition process.",
    "explanation": "This answer presents a detailed comparison of the two electrodes. It explains how the cathode receives copper via reduction while the anode dissolves by oxidation, thus balancing the system by maintaining ion concentration in the solution.",
