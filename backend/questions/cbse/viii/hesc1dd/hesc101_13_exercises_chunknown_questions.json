(b) The first step before growing crops is ________ of the soil. (c) Damaged seeds would ________ on top of water. (d) For growing a crop, sufficient sunlight and ________ and ________ from the soil are essential.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) crop, (b) preparation, (c) float, (d) nutrients and water.",
    "explanation": "The term 'crop' refers to plants of the same type grown on a large scale. The initial activity in agriculture is the preparation of soil. Damaged seeds are lighter and tend to float on water, and for optimal crop growth, plants require sunlight along with essential nutrients and water from the soil.",

    "explanation": "Kharif crops are sown in the rainy season and include paddy and maize, whereas Rabi crops, grown in winter, include wheat, gram, and pea.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Answers will vary. For example: \n(a) Preparation of soil involves tilling, loosening and leveling the soil to bring nutrient‐rich layers to the surface. \n(b) Sowing is the process of placing healthy seeds in the ground at the appropriate depth and spacing for optimal germination and growth. \n(c) Weeding is the removal or control of unwanted plants that compete with the crop for water, nutrients, space, and light. \n(d) Threshing is the process of separating the grain from the chaff, typically done manually using winnowing techniques or mechanically with a combine.",
    "explanation": "Each paragraph must explain the basic steps and importance of the process. Preparation of soil ensures the proper aeration and availability of nutrients, sowing sets the stage for germination, weeding prevents competition from undesired plants, and threshing is necessary to retrieve the harvestable seeds.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Fertilisers are man-made inorganic salts produced in factories that are rich in specific nutrients (e.g., urea provides nitrogen, ammonium sulphate provides both nitrogen and sulphur) but do not add humus to the soil. In contrast, manure is an organic substance produced by the decomposition of cattle dung and plant residues, which not only provides nutrients but also improves soil texture and water-holding capacity.",
    "explanation": "This answer underscores that fertilisers supply concentrated nutrients essential for plant growth, whereas manure enhances soil structure and fertility through the addition of organic matter (humus) and beneficial microbes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Irrigation is the artificial supply of water to crops at regular intervals to support growth by replenishing soil moisture. Two methods that conserve water are: \n1. Drip Irrigation – where water is delivered drop by drop near the plant roots, minimizing water loss by evaporation and runoff; \n2. Sprinkler Irrigation – where water is sprayed through pipes with rotating nozzles, ensuring even distribution and reduced wastage on uneven terrain.",
    "explanation": "Irrigation ensures the adequate supply of water, which is crucial for plant metabolic processes, nutrient uptake, and temperature regulation. Drip and sprinkler systems are modern techniques that maximize water use efficiency and are particularly beneficial in regions with limited water resources.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "If wheat, which is a rabi crop, is sown in the kharif (rainy) season, it is likely to suffer from excessive moisture and high temperatures, affecting germination, growth, and ultimately yield. Wheat requires cooler conditions during its growing period; the rainy season increases the risk of fungal infections and waterlogging, resulting in stunted growth and poor quality grains.",
    "explanation": "Wheat is adapted to grow in cooler, drier conditions. In contrast, the kharif season is marked by high humidity and heavy rainfall, conditions that are not conducive to wheat production. This misalignment of crop season and environmental conditions leads to reduced photosynthesis, nutrient leaching, and disease susceptibility.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Continuous cropping without allowing the soil to rest or replenish its nutrients leads to nutrient depletion, reduced organic matter, and degradation of soil structure. Over time, essential minerals are diminished, lowering the soil’s fertility and adversely affecting crop yield. Practices like fallowing, crop rotation, and the addition of organic manure are necessary to restore soil health.",
    "explanation": "Each cycle of cultivation removes some of the nutrients from the soil. Without proper replenishment, the soil becomes less capable of supporting healthy plant growth. This decline necessitates intervention measures to restore its nutrient content and maintain its texture and water-holding capacity.",

    "correct_answer": "Weeds are undesirable plants that grow in a field along with the crop and compete for water, nutrients, space, and sunlight. They can be controlled by manual weeding using tools such as the khurpi, mechanical methods like the seed drill for uprooting, and chemical control using weedicides.",
    "explanation": "Weed control is essential to prevent competition with crop plants. Early removal of weeds before they flower and set seed is the most effective strategy, and care should be taken during chemical control to protect the health of the person spraying.",

    "explanation": "The process begins with preparing the soil, followed by ploughing, then sowing the seeds. After sowing, manuring improves soil fertility, then irrigation is provided for growth, followed by harvesting when the crop is mature, and finally the crop is sent to the factory for processing.",
