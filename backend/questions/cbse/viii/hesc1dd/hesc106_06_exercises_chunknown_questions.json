    "correct_answer": "Reproduction is vital because it allows organisms to pass on their genetic material to the next generation, ensuring species survival, promoting genetic diversity, and supporting evolution and adaptation to changing environments.",
    "explanation": "Reproduction—whether sexual or asexual—is the process by which life is continued. In sexual reproduction, the mixing of genetic materials from two parents promotes variation that is essential for evolution. In asexual reproduction, rapid population increases can occur without the need for a mate. These processes are fundamental to maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance.",

    "correct_answer": "Fertilisation in humans begins when a mature ovum is released from the ovary during ovulation. Millions of sperm travel through the female reproductive tract, and when one sperm successfully penetrates the outer layer of the ovum, the two nuclei fuse to form a zygote. This zygote then begins cell division and later implants in the uterine wall to develop into an embryo.",
    "explanation": "The process starts with ovulation, followed by the movement of sperm towards the egg in the female reproductive system. When a sperm makes contact with and fuses to the ovum, their nuclei combine to produce a single nucleus in the zygote. The zygote undergoes rapid mitotic divisions and eventually implants in the uterine wall—this implantation is critical for providing the developing embryo with nutrients and a stable environment for growth.",

    "correct_answer": "Asexual reproduction is a biological process where a single parent produces genetically identical offspring without the involvement of gamete fusion. In animals, two common methods are budding and binary fission. In budding, such as in hydra, small outgrowths (buds) develop on the parent’s body and eventually detach. In binary fission, as seen in amoeba, the nucleus divides followed by the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two daughter cells.",
    "explanation": "Asexual reproduction does not require a mate, which means the offspring are genetically identical to the parent. Budding and binary fission are two primary examples: Budding involves the formation of a new individual from a protrusion that grows out from the parent's body, while in binary fission the parent cell splits into two parts after the replication of its genetic material. Both methods are efficient strategies for rapid population increase in suitable conditions.",

    "explanation": "Metamorphosis involves profound changes in morphology and physiology. In amphibians like frogs, the process includes the development of limbs and the reorganization of internal organs.

    "correct_answer": "Internal fertilisation occurs within the female’s body, where the gametes fuse in a controlled environment (as seen in humans, cows, and hens), whereas external fertilisation occurs outside the body, usually in water, where eggs and sperm are released into the environment and fertilisation happens externally (as seen in fish and amphibians).",
    "explanation": "In internal fertilisation, the embryo is protected inside the female’s body, leading to higher chances of development under stable conditions. This method is common in mammals and birds. Conversely, external fertilisation involves the release of gametes into the external environment, which can be less predictable due to environmental variables such as temperature, predators, and water currents, hence the production of a large number of eggs is necessary to ensure that some are successfully fertilised.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Layers are hens kept primarily for egg production, whereas broilers are chickens raised for meat production. Typically, hens in commercial production lay unfertilised eggs; fertilisation occurs only when a rooster is present. In commercial settings, the eggs available in stores are generally unfertilised. Fertilised eggs are not commonly consumed due to ethical, cultural, and safety considerations, and there is minimal difference in nutritional content between fertilised and unfertilised eggs.",
    "explanation": "This field investigation encourages real-world application of biological concepts. By interacting with a poultry farm, students learn the differences in management practices based on the end product—eggs or meat. They understand that in the absence of roosters, hens lay unfertilised eggs, which are the norm in commercial egg production. The nutritional content of the egg remains almost the same regardless of fertilisation because the early stages of embryo development have not significantly altered the egg's composition.",

    "explanation": "This inquiry-based investigation connects human reproductive biology and genetics. By consulting a medical expert and observing real-life cases, students learn that the origin of identical twins (monozygotic splitting) accounts for their identical genetic makeup, including sex chromosomes, while fraternal (dizygotic) twins arise from separate fertilisation events.
