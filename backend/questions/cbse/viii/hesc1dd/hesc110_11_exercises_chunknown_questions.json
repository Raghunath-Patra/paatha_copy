    "correct_answer": "solids, liquids and gases",
    "explanation": "Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium to propagate. It can travel through gases, liquids, and solids because all these media have particles that can transmit the vibrational energy. Although the speed of sound varies in each medium due to differences in density and elasticity, the ability for sound to travel through them remains.",

    "correct_answer": "Noise is generally defined as any unwanted or unpleasant sound, whereas music is an organized and often harmonious sound that is pleasing to the ear. However, if music is too loud, disorganized, or played at an inappropriate time, it can become intrusive and be perceived as noise.",
    "explanation": "The distinction between noise and music lies in both the organization and the context of the sound. Music is typically structured with a melody and rhythm, making it pleasing and culturally valued. Noise, on the other hand, lacks such organization and is often disruptive. Moreover, even music can be adverse when it violates desired norms or volumes, turning into noise if it disturbs concentration or peace.",

    "explanation": "Noise pollution originates from multiple sources in our everyday environment. In urban areas, traffic (including honking and engine noise), construction, and industrial activities are major contributors.

    "explanation": "Excessive sound levels can damage the sensitive structures of the ear, leading to temporary or permanent hearing loss. Moreover, continuous exposure to high noise levels raises stress hormones in the body, disrupts sleep patterns, and may even cause long-term health problems such as high blood pressure and anxiety. Understanding these effects is essential for implementing noise control measures in both public and private spaces.",

    "explanation": "Houses located closer to busy roads are subject to higher levels of noise pollution due to constant traffic and honking, which can lead to stress and hearing-related issues over time. A house further away offers a buffer against these environmental disturbances and can improve overall quality of life by providing a quieter space.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The larynx, or voice box, is an organ located at the upper end of the windpipe. It houses the vocal cords, which vibrate when air passes between them to produce sound. This vibration is modulated by adjusting the tension and length of the vocal cords, which in turn affects the pitch and quality of the sound produced.",
    "explanation": "The larynx plays a crucial role in voice production. The diagram of the larynx typically shows a cartilaginous structure with the vocal cords stretched inside. When air expelled from the lungs passes through the narrow gap between the vocal cords, it sets them into vibration, creating sound waves. Muscular control over the cords allows for variations in pitch and tone, which is essential for speech and singing.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "This occurs because light travels much faster than sound. While the lightning's light reaches us almost instantly, the sound of thunder travels relatively slowly, causing it to be heard with a delay.",
    "explanation": "Light travels at a speed of approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second, which means it covers vast distances almost instantly. Sound, however, travels at about 340 meters per second in air. Therefore, even when lightning and thunder occur simultaneously, the observer sees the lightning almost immediately but hears the thunder after a delay that is proportional to the distance between the source and the observer.",
