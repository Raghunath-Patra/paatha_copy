    "correct_answer": "Traditional irrigation systems, such as the moat, chain pump, dhekli, and rahat, often involve human or animal labor, making them cheaper in terms of initial cost but less efficient due to labor intensity and lower water delivery precision. Modern irrigation systems like sprinkler and drip systems use pumps powered by diesel, biogas, electricity, or solar energy. They are more efficient in terms of water usage and can be automated but require higher initial investment and maintenance costs.",
    "explanation": "The answer should discuss that traditional methods are cost-effective and accessible, especially in regions with low technological availability, but they frequently lead to higher water wastage and irregular watering. Meanwhile, modern systems not only save water through precise application (drip systems) but also use techniques suited for irregular terrains (sprinkler systems), enhancing crop yield even though they have higher financial and energy inputs.",

    "correct_answer": "The sprinkler system consists of a network of perpendicular pipes fitted with rotating nozzles attached to the main pipeline. Water is pumped under pressure through these pipes, causing it to spray out in a pattern similar to rainfall. This system is especially useful on uneven land where water availability is limited, as the pressure-driven sprinkling helps achieve even distribution, making it ideal for lawns, coffee plantations, and similar crops.",
    "explanation": "The detailed explanation should include that because water is released uniformly over the crop area, sprinkler systems maximize coverage even on irregular terrains. Also, the rotation of nozzles ensures that the water is evenly applied, which is efficient for crops that require consistent watering without waterlogging any particular section.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In summer, irrigation frequency is increased due to the higher rate of evaporation, which causes the moisture in the soil and on the leaves to evaporate more quickly. This leads to rapid drying of the soil, which can hamper seed germination, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. Regular irrigation compensates for this loss of moisture, ensuring that the plants receive adequate water to support growth, nutrient transport, and protection against extreme heat.",
    "explanation": "A strong evaluation should mention that the rapid evaporation in summer not only reduces available soil moisture but may also stress plants due to heat. This increase in irrigation frequency is a direct response to maintain sufficient water levels in the root zone, which is critical for maintaining the physiological processes of the plant such as nutrient absorption and transpiration regulation.",

It also softens the seed coat to enable microbial activity and nutrient absorption. Furthermore, water acts as a solvent for nutrients, enabling their transport throughout the plant, and regulates temperature by protecting crops from frost and excessive heat. Thus, water helps in maintaining physiological balance and supports overall plant development.",
    "explanation": "An effective answer should detail that without water, seeds cannot break dormancy and metabolize stored food.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process begins with tilling (or ploughing), which involves turning and loosening the soil to improve aeration and allow deeper root penetration. This step also brings nutrient-rich soil from below the surface to the top, enhancing nutrient availability. The incorporation of manure before tilling further enriches the soil by adding organic matter and essential nutrients. After tilling, levelling is carried out to break large soil clumps and to create a smooth, even surface. This ensures uniform sowing of seeds and proper irrigation. Together, these steps create a conducive environment for plant growth by ensuring well-aerated, moisture-retentive, and nutrient-dense soil.",
