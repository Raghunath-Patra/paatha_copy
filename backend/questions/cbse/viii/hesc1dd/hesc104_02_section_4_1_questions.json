    "correct_answer": "The cup with water does not burn because the water absorbs much of the heat via conduction, preventing the paper from reaching its ignition temperature.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Activity 4.2, three cases were observed: (a) When the glass chimney was raised on blocks, air could enter from the bottom, allowing the candle flame to burn steadily; (b) when the chimney rested directly on the table, reduced air inflow caused the flame to flicker and produce smoke due to incomplete combustion; (c) with a glass plate on top, the air supply was cut off completely, and the flame was extinguished. These observations highlight the essential role of a sufficient oxygen supply in sustaining combustion.",
    "explanation": "The experiment demonstrates that oxygen is crucial for maintaining the combustion reaction. When oxygen is limited, combustion becomes incomplete (flickering and smoky flame) or stops entirely (flame extinguishing). This clearly illustrates the relationship between oxygen availability and the combustion process.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a safety match is struck against the rough surface, friction generates heat which converts a small amount of red phosphorus to white phosphorus. The white phosphorus then reacts with potassium chlorate present in the match head to produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide, initiating the combustion of the match. This controlled sequence of chemical reactions enables safe ignition with reduced hazards compared to earlier match compositions.",
    "explanation": "The process starts with friction-induced heat that catalyzes a chemical conversion of red to white phosphorus. The white phosphorus reacts with potassium chlorate in an exothermic manner, which then ignites the antimony trisulphide. By eliminating white phosphorus from the match head and transferring it to the rubbing surface in safety matches, the burning process becomes safer for both the manufacturer and the user.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The physical state of a fuel greatly influences its combustion behavior and ignition temperature. Solids, such as wood or paper, generally require a higher surface area to ignite and their internal structure can affect heat conduction. Liquids like kerosene oil evaporate to form flammable vapors, meaning they have lower ignition temperatures once vaporized compared to solids. Gaseous fuels mix readily with air, leading to rapid combustion once the ignition point is reached. In practical applications, gas stoves utilize gaseous fuels for quick ignition; liquid fuels are used in engines after vaporization; and the combustion of solids is harnessed in applications like firewood burning where controlled heat release is necessary.",
    "explanation": "The state influences factors like fuel vaporization, surface area, and heat transfer. For example, liquid fuels produce combustible vapors that can ignite easily when mixed with air, while solid fuels require sufficient heat to break down and release combustible compounds. These principles are critical in designing safety protocols and efficient combustion systems in various industries.",
