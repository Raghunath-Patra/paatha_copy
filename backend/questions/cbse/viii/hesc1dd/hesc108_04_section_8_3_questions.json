    "correct_answer": "When forces act in opposite directions, the net force is the difference between the magnitudes of these forces. If the forces are equal, they cancel each other out, and the object remains in equilibrium. However, if they are unequal, the object accelerates towards the direction of the larger force. Examples include tug-of-war (where each team pulls in opposite directions) and a situation where wind pushes against a moving vehicle, affecting its motion.",
    "explanation": "The net effect on the object's motion depends on the balance of the forces. Equal forces yield no resultant acceleration (equilibrium), while unequal forces produce acceleration toward the larger force.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed by using a force sensor attached to a heavy object like a box. First, measure the force required to move the box when pushed by one person alone. Then, have two people push from the same side while measuring the individual forces with separate sensors. Finally, have them push from opposite sides and record the forces. Compare the net force by calculating the vector sum of the forces. Measurements should be taken in Newtons (N) to maintain consistency, and repeated trials can enhance accuracy.",
    "explanation": "The proposed experiment uses force sensors to capture quantitative data on the applied forces. By comparing different scenarios—one person, two persons in the same direction, and two persons in opposite directions—the net force can be accurately determined. This method not only reinforces the concept of net force but also introduces students to practical measurement techniques and data analysis in experimental physics.",

    "explanation": "This question links the concept of net force with Newton’s First Law of Motion. A net force of zero implies equilibrium, meaning no acceleration and a constant state of motion.
