    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Tectonic plates are large fragments of the Earth's crust that are constantly in motion due to forces in the mantle. When these plates interact at their boundaries—whether by colliding (subduction), sliding past each other (transform boundaries), or moving apart (divergent boundaries)—stress builds up in the Earth's crust. When this stress is released suddenly, it causes a shaking of the ground known as an earthquake. This sudden release generates seismic waves that travel through the Earth, which are recorded by instruments such as seismographs.",
    "explanation": "This answer details the process from the movement of tectonic plates through the buildup and release of stress, leading to the generation of seismic waves. It connects plate tectonics with the mechanisms that produce observable earthquake phenomena.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Quake-safe building design involves several measures including: using light and flexible materials such as mud or timber that are less prone to collapse, reinforcing structures with proper engineering designs to withstand shaking, fixing cabinets and heavy items to the walls to prevent them from falling, and installing fire suppression equipment to mitigate secondary hazards like fires. These measures reduce the likelihood of complete structural failure and protect occupants by minimizing falling debris and collapse risks during an earthquake.",
