It also accelerates deforestation by using 17 full-grown trees per tonne of paper. Recycling paper mitigates these effects by reducing the need for new raw materials, thereby conserving water and energy and lowering chemical usage.

    "correct_answer": "Current paper production practices are unsustainable due to heavy reliance on tree consumption, excessive water and energy use, and chemical application. Improvements can be made by promoting recycling, which allows paper to be reused multiple times (5-7 times), encouraging individuals to save paper daily, and implementing reuse strategies to decrease waste. These actions lower the overall demand for fresh raw material, conserve water and energy, and reduce chemical pollutants, contributing to a more sustainable production cycle.",
