    "correct_answer": "A. Force produced by the muscles of our body. Muscular force is generated by the action of muscles, allowing us to push, pull, or lift objects.",
    "explanation": "Muscular force comes from the contraction of muscles in our body. When you lift a bucket or push a door, your muscles generate the necessary force, making it an example of a contact force.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Muscular force is essential for nearly all movements in the human body. It is produced by the contraction of muscles which results in movements such as walking, lifting, bending, and even internal processes like the movement of food in the alimentary canal. For example, lifting a cup of water requires muscular force in the arms, and the act of breathing involves the contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.",
    "explanation": "The contracting muscles not only allow us to perform major physical tasks like running or dancing but also facilitate the functioning of internal organs, such as moving food along the digestive tract and enabling the lungs to expand during breathing. These examples underscore the versatility and essential nature of muscular force in daily life.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Friction opposes the motion of objects in contact, causing them to slow down and eventually stop. Factors that influence the magnitude of friction include the nature of the surfaces in contact (rough or smooth), the normal force pressing the surfaces together, and the materials’ properties. For instance, when a car stops, friction between the tires and the road is critical for deceleration. Similarly, a sliding book on a table eventually comes to rest because of the frictional force between the book and the table.",
    "explanation": "Friction is vital in many practical applications, both beneficial and problematic. In vehicles, friction is harnessed in the brake system, yet excessive friction can lead to wear and tear on mechanical parts. Understanding these factors helps in designing systems that either maximize friction (for safety in braking) or minimize it (for efficient machinery).",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment is to use a smooth inclined plane and a rough inclined plane. Place a toy car on each plane from the same height and measure the distance it travels before coming to rest. The independent variable is the surface texture (smooth vs. rough), and the dependent variable is the stopping distance. The expected outcome is that the car on the rough inclined plane will stop sooner than the one on the smooth inclined plane, demonstrating the greater frictional force on rough surfaces.",
    "explanation": "This experiment clearly shows how friction affects motion. By controlling other factors (like the height of the incline and the mass of the car), the impact of friction can be isolated. The differing stopping distances serve as evidence for the role of friction, linking real-world observation with scientific reasoning. Such an experiment can be extended to test different materials and surface conditions.",
