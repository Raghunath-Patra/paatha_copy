    "correct_answer": "Friction is the resistive force arising when two surfaces rub against each other. It can be increased deliberately by adding surface grooves, treads, or using materials that have rough textures, such as the tread on tyres or the grooved soles of shoes, and by using brake pads in vehicles.",
    "explanation": "Friction results from the interlocking of microscopic surface irregularities when two surfaces come in contact.

    "correct_answer": "Kabaddi players and gymnasts often alter the texture of their hands by applying soil or a coarse substance to increase friction. This modification enhances grip by providing a rougher surface that improves the interlocking with the opponent's skin or apparatus, thereby preventing slipping.",
    "explanation": "The application of substances that increase surface roughness results in higher friction when the hands contact another surface. This enhanced grip is crucial in sports where maintaining hold and control is key to performance and safety.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Friction is beneficial in situations where grip and control are required, such as the grooved soles of shoes, treaded tyres, and brake pads in vehicles that help in stopping motion. Conversely, friction can be detrimental when it leads to excessive wear, energy loss, or unwanted resistance in machinery. In these cases, lubricants like oil, grease, and fine powders are used to reduce friction. For example, lubricants in engine parts reduce friction to increase efficiency and prevent wear, while sprinkling powder on a carrom board allows for smoother gliding of pieces.",
    "explanation": "The dual nature of friction means that while it is necessary for activities like walking, driving, and playing sports, it can also hinder the performance of mechanical systems by causing energy loss and wear. Designers and engineers therefore have to carefully manage friction by increasing it where needed for safety or control, and reducing it in machines to improve efficiency and longevity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Lubricants like oil and grease are highly effective in reducing friction because they form a continuous film that minimizes direct contact between moving parts, thus reducing wear and improving efficiency. However, these lubricants have limitations including degradation over time, sensitivity to temperature changes, and potential contamination of parts. Alternatives like the use of air cushions or magnetic levitation can further reduce friction by eliminating physical contact altogether. These methods are particularly useful in high-precision or high-speed applications.",
    "explanation": "While traditional lubricants significantly decrease friction by creating a barrier between surfaces, their effectiveness can diminish with wear, contamination, or extreme operating conditions. Alternatives such as air cushions provide a near-frictionless environment by suspending components in a thin layer of air, eliminating mechanical contact. Each method has its own set of advantages and challenges, making the selection dependent on specific application needs.",
