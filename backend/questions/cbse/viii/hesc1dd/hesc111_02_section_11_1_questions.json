    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Activity 11.5 involves adding different solutes to distilled water in separate containers: one with an acid (e.g., lemon juice or dilute hydrochloric acid), one with a base (e.g., caustic soda or potassium iodide), and one with a molecular compound (sugar). Acids, bases, and salts ionize in water, releasing free ions that facilitate electrical conduction. In contrast, sugar dissolves in water but does not ionize into charged particles; thus, its solution remains a poor conductor of electricity.",
    "explanation": "The conduction of electricity in solutions is dependent on the presence of ions. For acids like HCl, the dissociation reaction is HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻. For bases like NaOH, the reaction is NaOH → Na⁺ + OH⁻. Salts dissociate similarly. In contrast, sugar (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁) simply dissolves without dissociation, resulting in a lack of free ions and poor conductivity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Activity 11.3, a wire is coiled around a matchbox tray, and a compass is placed inside the coil. When an electric current flows through the wire (even a weak one), it produces a magnetic field that causes the compass needle to deflect. This method is more sensitive than relying solely on the glowing of a bulb, which may not respond well to weak currents. An LED is advantageous because it can emit light at lower currents due to its lower threshold voltage, making it a more reliable indicator of conductivity in cases where the electric current is very weak.",
    "explanation": "The deflection of a compass needle is directly related to the magnetic field generated by the current through the coil. This sensitivity allows for the detection of even small currents. LEDs, by their design, require less current to operate than traditional bulbs, providing a clear visual cue even with minimal current flow.",
