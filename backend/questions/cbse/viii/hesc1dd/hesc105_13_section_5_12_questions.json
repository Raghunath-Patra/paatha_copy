    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Reforestation involves planting trees in deforested areas, usually ensuring that the species planted are as close as possible to those originally present to maintain ecological continuity. This process can be carried out by human initiatives or can occur naturally when areas are left undisturbed. The significance of reforestation lies in its ability to restore habitats, stabilize soils, regulate water cycles, and mitigate climate change by absorbing CO₂. Natural reforestation complements human efforts by allowing indigenous flora to reestablish and create a balanced ecosystem.",
    "explanation": "The process starts with selecting appropriate tree species, preparing the land, and then planting and caring for the trees. Over time, a successfully reforested area will provide improved biodiversity, support fauna, and contribute to a healthier biosphere. Natural reforestation can occur when disruptions are minimized, letting ecological processes take their course.",

    "correct_answer": "The Forest (Conservation) Act plays a crucial role in regulating the use of forest land, ensuring that deforestation activities are minimized and that natural forests are preserved. Key advantages include legal protection for forests, promotion of sustainable forest management, and support for the local communities that depend on these resources. However, potential limitations include enforcement challenges, bureaucratic delays, and conflicts between developmental needs and conservation goals.",
    "explanation": "The act provides a legal framework to restrict the conversion of forest land for non-forest purposes, promoting conservation. Its success is tied to effective implementation and community involvement. The analysis involves evaluating both the legal benefits and the practical challenges encountered in maintaining and preserving forest ecosystems in a rapidly developing country like India.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Reforestation efforts face multiple challenges including choosing the appropriate species that can survive in a changing climate, managing the variability in weather patterns, and mitigating adverse impacts from ongoing human activities like urbanization and industrialization. Moreover, ensuring genetic diversity while replicating native ecosystems is complicated by invasive species, pests, and diseases. These factors collectively make reforestation a complex but essential task for restoring ecological balance in the face of global environmental change.",
    "explanation": "A thorough evaluation must consider regional ecological differences, the sustainability of planting practices, and how climate change is altering growth patterns. Addressing these challenges requires adaptive management strategies, research in climate-resilient species, and strong policy support to integrate reforestation into broader environmental and developmental agendas.",
