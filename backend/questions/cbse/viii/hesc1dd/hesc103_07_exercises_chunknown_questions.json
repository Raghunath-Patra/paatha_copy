    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "CNG and LPG are advantageous because they are cleaner burning (produce less pollution), easier to transport especially in pipeline form (in the case of CNG), have high energy delivery and help in reducing dependence on more polluting fuels such as petrol and diesel.",
    "explanation": "CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) burns more cleanly than conventional fuels and has lower carbon emissions. LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is also less polluting and is efficient in terms of combustion. These factors make them desirable for both industrial and domestic energy use. This answer addresses energy conservation and air quality improvement through better fuel choices.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Coal is formed from the remains of dense forests that existed about 300 million years ago. Dead plants get buried under soil and sediment, and over millions of years they undergo compression and are subjected to high temperature and pressure. This slow transformation of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonisation.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with the burial of vegetation in swampy conditions. As sediments accumulate, increasing pressure and temperature gradually convert organic matter into coal through carbonisation. This process is a key example of fossil fuel formation that takes millions of years, hence explaining why coal is a non-renewable resource.",

    "explanation": "Each statement is evaluated based on the processes and properties described in the text. Fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas, are formed over millions of years and cannot be reproduced in a laboratory. CNG is less polluting than petrol. Coke, obtained from coal, is almost pure carbon, and coal tar is a complex mixture of several substances. Kerosene is a fraction of petroleum, and thus it is a fossil fuel.",

    "question_text": "Explain why fossil fuels are exhaustible natural resources.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Fossil fuels are exhaustible because they are formed over millions of years from the remains of dead organisms. The rate of formation is extremely slow compared to the rate at which these fuels are being consumed by human activities. In addition, the total reserves are finite and extensive extraction has led to depletion, making them non-renewable resources.",
    "explanation": "The formation of fossil fuels involves the gradual conversion of biological material under high pressure and temperature over geological timescales. Since humans extract and use these fuels much faster than their natural creation, their reserves are limited. This is why conservation and alternative energy sources are being actively pursued to mitigate environmental impact.",

    "correct_answer": "Coke is a tough, porous, and black substance that is almost a pure form of carbon. It is produced by the processing of coal and has high carbon content. Its main uses are in the manufacture of steel and in the extraction of metals from their ores, owing to its ability to provide high temperatures and a reducing atmosphere during metallurgical processes.",
    "explanation": "Coke is valued for its purity and its physical properties such as high strength and porosity, which make it ideal as a reducing agent in smelting processes. Its use in steel manufacturing is critical, as it helps remove impurities from iron ore, ensuring the production of quality steel.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Petroleum is formed from the remains of marine organisms that settled on the bottom of ancient seas. Over millions of years, these organic remains were buried under layers of sand and clay. The absence of oxygen combined with high pressure and temperature transformed these remains into petroleum and natural gas through a process that involves chemical reactions such as thermal cracking.",
    "explanation": "The formation of petroleum is a complex process that requires the accumulation of organic matter, suitable burial conditions, and a long period for transformation. This process, influenced by geological factors, leads to the creation of reservoirs where petroleum and natural gas are trapped, often requiring drilling to extract them.",
