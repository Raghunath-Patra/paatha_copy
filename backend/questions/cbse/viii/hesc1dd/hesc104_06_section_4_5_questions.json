      "A) A small spark is generated",
      "B) A continuous flame appears",
      "C) The tube shatters due to heat",
      "D) No visible change occurs"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B) A continuous flame appears. The flame forms because unburnt wax vapours travel through the tube and ignite when they come into contact with the matchstick's flame.",
    "explanation": "This observation demonstrates that the innermost dark zone of a candle flame contains unburnt wax vapours. When these vapours travel through the tube and meet an ignition source, they burn, forming a continuous flame.",

    "correct_answer": "The experiment starts by lighting a candle and inserting a thin glass tube into the dark, innermost zone of the flame using tongs. A lighted matchstick is then brought near the free end of the tube. Soon after, a flame appears at the end of the tube, indicating that wax vapours have travelled from the inner zone through the tube and ignited. This observation confirms that the unburnt wax vapours are responsible for flame production. Additionally, introducing a glass slide into the luminous zone results in a blackish ring due to the deposition of carbon, further illustrating differences in combustion across flame zones.",
    "explanation": "This detailed description explains the experimental design which divides the candle flame into different zones. The appearance of a flame at the tubeâ€™s end, due to vaporised wax, demonstrates that fuel in the gas phase contributes to combustion. The observation on the glass slide corroborates the nature of the yellow zone as one where incomplete combustion occurs, depositing carbon particles.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The temperature in a candle flame varies with the zone: the innermost dark zone (lowest temperature) contains unburnt wax vapours, the middle yellow luminous zone has moderate temperature due to partial combustion, and the outermost blue zone is the hottest because of complete combustion. These temperature variations are critical in determining the chemical reactions that occur in each zone. In real-world applications, such as metal melting in goldsmithing, the hottest outer zone is harnessed to provide the high heat necessary to reach the melting points of metals like gold and silver. Moreover, understanding these variations aids in optimizing combustion for industrial burners and chemical reactors, ensuring efficiency and safety.",
    "explanation": "This analysis emphasizes the relationship between combustion efficiency and temperature distribution within the flame.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A possible experimental design would include using candles with different wick lengths while keeping other properties (such as candle size and wax type) constant. The setup would involve a thermocouple or infrared thermometer to measure temperature at different zones of the flame, specifically in the innermost, middle, and outermost zones. Data collection would be done by recording temperatures at fixed intervals and under controlled conditions (no wind, constant ambient temperature). The independent variable is wick length, while dependent variables are the measured temperatures in each zone. It is expected that longer wick lengths might produce a larger flame with altered temperature gradients, possibly due to changes in fuel vaporisation rates and oxygen availability.",
    "explanation": "This experimental design enables investigation into the relationship between wick length and flame temperature distribution. Using precise temperature measurement tools and maintaining control over external factors allows for an accurate representation of how wick length influences combustion efficiency and the resultant heat distribution.",
