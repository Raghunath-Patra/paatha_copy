    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "After fertilisation, the zygote divides repeatedly, forming a ball of cells called a blastocyst. This ball of cells implants into the uterine wall and continues to differentiate into specific tissues and organs, marking the embryo stage. As development proceeds and all major body parts can be identified, the embryo is then referred to as a foetus.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with a single cell (zygote) that divides multiple times. As cells group and specialize, the embryo forms and implants into the uterus, where nourishment is provided for continued growth, leading to the formation of a fully developed foetus.",

    "correct_answer": "Internal fertilisation occurs within the body, ensuring protection and increased chances of successful fertilisation, as seen in humans (and other mammals) and hens. In contrast, external fertilisation happens outside the body, often in water, and is characteristic of aquatic animals such as frogs and fish. In external fertilisation, despite the production of a large number of gametes, factors like water movement and predators reduce the number of fertilised eggs.",
    "explanation": "The key differences lie in the location of fertilisation and the subsequent survival strategies: internal fertilisation benefits from a controlled environment within the female body, while external fertilisation requires the production of many gametes due to environmental uncertainty.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Viviparous reproduction is when animals give birth to live young, such as in mammals (e.g., humans, dogs, cows). Oviparous reproduction refers to animals laying eggs which then develop outside the mother's body, as seen in birds (e.g., hens, crows), reptiles, amphibians, and many insects. The key difference lies in where and how the embryonic development occurs—inside the mother’s body for viviparous animals and externally within an egg for oviparous animals.",
    "explanation": "The reproduction strategies are adapted to environmental conditions. Viviparous animals protect the developing embryo inside their body, whereas oviparous animals depend on the external environment to support embryonic development, which often requires protective coverings like hard shells or jelly layers.",

    "correct_answer": "False. Test-tube babies are developed by fertilising egg and sperm outside the body (in vitro), and the resulting zygote is then transferred to the mother's uterus where it grows normally.",
    "explanation": "The term 'test-tube babies' is misleading because the fertilisation does not occur in test tubes; instead, the zygote is cultured for a short period before being placed in the uterus for further development.",
