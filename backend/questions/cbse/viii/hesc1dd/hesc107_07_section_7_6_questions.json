    "correct_answer": "Gametes are the reproductive cells (egg and sperm) that carry only one set of chromosomes, making them haploid. They are essential for sexual reproduction because their fusion during fertilization restores the diploid number of chromosomes in the zygote.",

    "correct_answer": "Fertilisation is the process where a sperm cell from the father and an egg cell from the mother unite to form a zygote. The egg always contributes an X chromosome, while the sperm can contribute either an X or a Y chromosome. If the sperm contributes an X chromosome, the resulting zygote becomes XX (female). If the sperm contributes a Y chromosome, the zygote becomes XY (male).",
    "explanation": "This process not only combines the genetic material from both parents but also determines the biological sex of the offspring. The consistent contribution from the egg and the variable contribution from the sperm underlies sex determination in humans.",

    "correct_answer": "Understanding that the egg solely carries an X chromosome, while the sperm carries the determining factor (either an X or a Y chromosome), clearly shows that the father's genetic contribution is responsible for determining the sex of the baby. This scientific fact debunks the myth that the mother can influence the sex of her baby, shifting the focus away from outdated cultural beliefs.",
    "explanation": "By recognizing that the egg’s genetic material is constant (always X) and that only the sperm carries the variable sex-determining chromosome, the misconception that the mother influences the baby’s sex is scientifically disproven.
