    "correct_answer": "When the paper is bent, it creates a plane that does not lie in the same plane as the incident ray and normal, causing the reflected ray to deviate from the flat surface where it can be observed.",
    "explanation": "The law of reflection requires that the incident ray, normal, and reflected ray all lie in one plane. Bending the paper changes the plane on which the reflection would be visible, so the reflected ray is no longer observed on the surface.",

    "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates that light travels in a straight path. Draw a normal to the mirror at the point of incidence and mark the incident and reflected rays.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A virtual image is formed when light rays reflected from a mirror do not actually converge but appear to do so when extended backwards behind the mirror. The human eye interprets these extensions as coming from a single point, forming the image. However, since the rays never actually meet at this point, the image cannot be projected on a screen.",
    "explanation": "In a plane mirror, incident rays obey the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection). When these reflected rays are extended backward, they seem to originate from a point behind the mirror. This point is where the virtual image appears to be, but since the light does not physically converge there, a real image cannot be projected on a screen. This illustrates the virtual nature of plane mirror images and explains phenomena like lateral inversion.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The student should use a large flat surface like stiff chart paper, a plane mirror, and a comb (or an alternative narrow slit to generate a narrow beam) with sunlight as the light source. The mirror and slit should be securely fixed. The experiment requires marking the incident and reflected rays, drawing a normal at the point of incidence, and measuring angles with a protractor. Safety precautions include protecting eyes from direct sunlight and ensuring that the mirror does not reflect sunlight into people's eyes.",
    "explanation": "By directing sunlight through a slit (or using a suitable apparatus), a narrow beam is obtained. The beam will strike the plane mirror and reflect according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection). The student should record different sets of angles by changing the mirror's position, and then verify that the measured angles of incidence equal the angles of reflection. This experiment not only reinforces the law of reflection but also introduces the practical aspects of experimental design and safety when working with concentrated sunlight.",
