      "A copper rod",
      "An inflated balloon",
      "A woollen cloth"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A copper rod",
    "explanation": "Copper is a metal and a good conductor, so any charges produced by friction quickly dissipate through conduction (often via the person holding it) rather than accumulating. In contrast, insulators like plastic, balloons, and woollen cloth can hold static charge more effectively.",

      "Both the glass rod and the silk acquire positive charge",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "The glass rod becomes positively charged while the silk becomes negatively charged",
    "explanation": "In the frictional charging process, electrons are transferred from the glass rod to the silk. This leaves the glass rod with fewer electrons (a net positive charge) and the silk with extra electrons (a net negative charge).",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The crackling sound is produced by the rapid discharge of static electricity that builds up when friction between the sweater and your body causes electrons to be transferred. When the charge difference becomes large enough, a small spark or discharge occurs, which is heard as a crackling sound.",
    "explanation": "Friction between materials (such as a sweater and hair/clothes) results in the transfer of electrons, causing one object to become negatively charged and the other positively charged. When the charge imbalance becomes significant, a sudden discharge (static spark) occurs to neutralize the charge, producing a crackling sound.",

    "correct_answer": "When we touch a charged body with our hand, our body (being a good conductor) provides a path for the charge to leak away to the ground (earthing). This neutralizes or diminishes the charge on the body.",
    "explanation": "Human bodies are conductive, enabling electrons to flow between the charged object and earth. When a charged object is touched, the excess charge is transferred away (or redistributed) through the body to the ground, a process known as earthing.",

    "correct_answer": "The scale is the Richter scale. An earthquake with a magnitude of 3 is usually recorded by a sensitive seismograph but is generally not strong enough to cause significant damage.",

    "explanation": "To reduce the risk of injury during lightning storms, it is important to avoid being in open areas or near objects that can attract lightning.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Two charged balloons repel each other because they carry like charges, which, according to Coulomb’s law, experience a repulsive force. In contrast, when one balloon is charged and the other is uncharged, the uncharged balloon may undergo electrostatic induction, wherein a redistribution of charges occurs to create an induced opposite charge on the side nearest to the charged balloon, resulting in an attractive force.",
    "explanation": "When similar charges are present on two objects (for instance, both negatively charged), the repulsive force between like charges causes them to push away from each other. However, if one object is uncharged, bringing a charged object close to it induces a separation of charges within the uncharged object. The side nearest to the charged object accumulates opposite charge, leading to an attractive interaction. This demonstrates basic electrostatic principles and induction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The instrument is called an electroscope. It typically consists of a metal rod attached to a conductive metal leaf (or two thin foils) enclosed in a container. When a charged object touches the metal rod, charge is transferred to the leaves, causing them to repel each other. A diagram should show a jar or container with a cardboard lid, a paper clip inserted through the lid with two suspended aluminum foil strips.",
    "explanation": "An electroscope works on the principle of charge repulsion. When a charged vessel (or rod) transfers charge to the metal leaves, the like charges repel, causing the leaves to move apart. The extent of divergence can indicate the magnitude of the charge. Diagrams in textbooks often show a simple electroscope constructed from everyday materials, emphasising the flow of charge and the repulsive interaction between like charges.",

    "explanation": "Earthquakes in India largely occur along tectonic plate boundaries and fault zones.
