    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The menstrual cycle begins with the maturation of an ovum in one of the ovaries, triggered by hormonal signals at the onset of puberty. As the ovum matures, one is released approximately every 28 to 30 days (ovulation). Concurrently, the uterine wall thickens, preparing to receive a fertilised egg. If fertilisation occurs, the ovum divides and embeds itself into the thickened lining, initiating pregnancy. If fertilisation does not occur, a drop in hormone levels signals the shedding of the thick uterine lining along with its blood vessels, leading to menstruation.",
    "explanation": "This explanation covers the sequential events of the menstrual cycle: ovum maturation, ovulation, preparation of the uterine lining (endometrium) via estrogen and progesterone, and menstrual bleeding when pregnancy does not occur.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In females, the reproductive phase begins at puberty, marked by the maturation of ova, and ends with menopause around the age of 45 to 50, due to cyclical ovum maturation and menstrual bleeding. In contrast, males become capable of reproduction at puberty with the production of sperm, and this ability generally continues for a longer period into later life. The longevity of the male reproductive phase is attributed to continual spermatogenesis, which does not cease at a defined age like female menstruation.",
    "explanation": "This answer evaluates the differences in reproductive duration, the nature of gamete production, and hormonal control between the sexes. Whereas females experience a limited reproductive window characterized by cyclical events like menstruation, males have a more extended reproductive period due to continuous sperm production.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hormones such as estrogen and progesterone play crucial roles in regulating the menstrual cycle. Estrogen is primarily responsible for the maturation of the ovum and the thickening of the uterine lining. After ovulation, progesterone takes over to further prepare the uterus for a possible pregnancy. If fertilisation does not occur, the levels of both hormones fall, triggering the shedding of the uterine lining as menstruation. This hormonal interplay ensures that the uterus is prepared each cycle for potential implantation, and if that does not happen, it resets for the next cycle.",
