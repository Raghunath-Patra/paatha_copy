    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An object's shape heavily influences the drag force because it determines how smoothly a fluid flows around it. A streamlined shape minimizes disturbances in the fluid flow, reducing the drag force. In contrast, a blunt or irregular shape causes more turbulent flow and greater energy loss.",
    "explanation": "When a fluid flows over a streamlined body, it adheres closely to its surface with minimal separation, thereby reducing friction. This efficient flow minimizes the energy required to push the fluid out of the way, resulting in lower drag. Tireless research and observations of nature have led to better understanding of fluid dynamics, ultimately guiding the design of high-speed vehicles.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Observations of birds and fishes have shown that naturally evolved streamlined shapes reduce drag and improve efficiency in fluid environments. Engineers have adopted these principles for designing vehicles like aeroplanes and cars. The streamlined design minimizes disturbances in the fluid, leading to decreased drag force, increased energy efficiency, and improved performance. By reducing the energy lost against fluid friction, vehicles can achieve higher speeds and better fuel economy.",
    "explanation": "Nature serves as an excellent model for efficient designs. Birds and fishes have had millions of years to refine their shapes to move easily through air and water. This natural selection has given rise to forms that reduce drag and resist deceleration. Modern engineers emulate these designs to create vehicles that require less power to overcome drag, thereby boosting performance and reducing energy consumption.",
