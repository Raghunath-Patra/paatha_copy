    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Heat treatments, such as boiling or pasteurisation, involve raising the temperature to levels that kill harmful microorganisms. In contrast, cold treatments like refrigeration do not kill microbes but instead slow down their metabolism and reproduction. For example, pasteurisation of milk is done by heating it to about 70°C for 15-30 seconds followed by rapid cooling.",
    "explanation": "Heat treatments effectively destroy microbial cells or inactivate enzymes that contribute to spoilage. Cold treatments, through refrigeration, reduce the rate of chemical reactions and microbial activity by lowering the temperature, hence delaying spoilage. Both methods are critical in ensuring that food remains safe and retains quality over time.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Salt preservation works by drawing moisture out of food and creating a hypertonic environment that inhibits bacterial growth, making it suitable for meat, fish, and some fruits. However, high salt content can negatively affect flavor and may not be suitable for individuals with dietary restrictions. Sugar preservation, on the other hand, also reduces available water through osmotic pressure, making it effective for jams, jellies, and squashes. The downside is that the high sugar content may not be desirable for all consumers and is limited to sweet preserves.",
    "explanation": "Both methods rely on reducing water activity in food, which is essential for microbial growth. Salting is one of the oldest preservation techniques, especially effective for protein-rich foods, while sugar preservation is primarily used for fruits and sweet products. The choice of method depends on the type of food and dietary requirements.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Packaged milk undergoes pasteurisation, a process in which milk is heated to approximately 70°C for 15-30 seconds and then rapidly cooled. This process effectively kills or inactivates harmful microorganisms that can cause spoilage or disease, making it safe for direct consumption without the need for further boiling.",
    "explanation": "Pasteurisation not only extends the shelf life of milk by reducing the microbial load but also helps preserve the nutritional quality of the milk. The rapid cooling after heating ensures that any heat-sensitive nutrients are retained as much as possible, making this method a reliable choice for food safety and quality.",
