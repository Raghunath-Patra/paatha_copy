    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both the spark from rubbing amber with fur and lightning are caused by the accumulation and sudden discharge of electric charges. In the case of amber, friction between the amber and fur transfers electrons, causing a static buildup, which can result in a small spark when discharged. In lightning, similar principles apply on a much larger scale, where the buildup of electrical charges in clouds is suddenly discharged, resulting in a large and powerful spark.",
    "explanation": "The response should detail how friction leads to electron transfer in both cases, and emphasize the scale difference between the two phenomena while highlighting the underlying physics involving charge accumulation and discharge.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The 2000-year gap illustrates that scientific progress often occurs gradually and is built upon cumulative observations and experiments over time. The early Greeks observed static effects but lacked the tools and theoretical framework to understand electrical phenomena fully. Benjamin Franklin's later experiments provided a crucial unifying theory that linked everyday static electricity to large-scale lightning, demonstrating how advancements in experimental techniques and scientific reasoning can lead to significant breakthroughs. This progression emphasizes the role of persistence, technological innovation, and the collaborative nature of scientific inquiry.",

    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment is to take a plastic comb and a piece of wool. First, comb the hair vigorously with the plastic comb for about 30 seconds to transfer electrons from the hair to the comb. Then, hold the comb near small bits of paper or pepper flakes and observe how they are attracted to the comb. This demonstrates the buildup of static electricity and its ability to exert a force on light objects.",
