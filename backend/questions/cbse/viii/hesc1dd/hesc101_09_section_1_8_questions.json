    "correct_answer": "Mechanical methods like using a combine machine offer advantages including reduced labor, increased efficiency, and consistent quality of harvested crops by performing simultaneous cutting and threshing. They also minimize crop losses due to uniformity in operation.",
    "explanation": "Mechanical harvesting significantly cuts down on the time and manual labor involved in harvesting. The combine machine ensures that crops are cut uniformly and that the grains are efficiently separated from chaff, minimizing waste and ensuring better quality. However, while machines offer efficiency, the high cost and suitability for large-scale farms are factors to consider.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The harvesting process begins with the crop maturing, which typically takes 3-4 months for cereals. Once the crop is mature, it is cut or pulled out from the field using manual tools like a sickle or machines such as harvesters. After harvesting, the grain is separated from the chaff through threshing—a process which can be performed using machines like combines. For small holdings, winnowing may also be employed as a method to separate the grain from the lighter chaff.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines the sequential steps in harvesting, emphasizing the importance of each stage: crop maturation sets the time frame; cutting marks the physical retrieval of the crop; threshing separates valuable grain from unwanted chaff; and winnowing may be additionally used depending on the scale of farming. Together, these steps ensure that the harvested produce is ready for storage or processing.",

    "correct_answer": "Burning crop stubs can lead to pollution and the risk of accidental fires that might damage nearby crops. Alternatives include leaving the stubs as organic matter to decompose naturally, using them as mulch to retain soil moisture and improve soil fertility, or collecting them for bioenergy production.",
    "explanation": "The environmental impact of burning includes air pollution and potential harm to soil quality. By adopting alternatives such as mulching or composting, farmers can enhance soil health while reducing negative effects on the environment. This approach also promotes sustainable agricultural practices.",
