    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A kaleidoscope works based on the principle of multiple reflections in a set of angled mirrors, typically arranged in a triangular prism. Light entering through the colored glass pieces reflects several times within the confined mirror space, creating multiple symmetrical images that combine to form intricate patterns. As the colored pieces continuously move due to rotation or shaking, the arrangement of reflected images constantly changes, ensuring that no two patterns are exactly alike.",
    "explanation": "The key to the kaleidoscope’s functionality is the repeated reflection from the mirrors, which are precisely angled to reflect the image of the colored fragments multiple times. This creates a mirror symmetry that is pleasing to the eye. Because small changes in the position of the colored glass pieces result in an entirely different pattern, the pattern seen through the viewing hole is always new. This is analogous to the concept of recursion in reflective systems.",
