    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Coal is formed from the remains of dense forests that thrived in low-lying wetland areas around 300 million years ago. Flooding and sedimentation buried these forests, and as more layers of soil accumulated, the pressure and temperature increased. Under these conditions, the dead plant material underwent carbonisation, gradually converting into coal—a fossil fuel comprised mainly of carbon.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with the burial of vegetation in swampy regions. The accumulation of sediments leads to increased pressure and temperature, initiating the carbonisation process. Over millions of years, the chemical transformation of plant matter into coal occurs, which explains both its fossil fuel nature and compositional characteristics. This geological and chemical understanding is crucial to appreciating how coal is formed.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Economically, coal has powered industrial growth by providing an affordable energy source and raw materials like coke for steel production. However, burning coal releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, contributing to air pollution and climate change. Environmental concerns also include ecosystem disruption from mining and potential water contamination. Balancing these economic benefits with environmental impacts requires better technology and a shift towards cleaner energy sources.",
    "explanation": "This answer requires an understanding of both the advantages and drawbacks of coal usage. While coal remains a cornerstone in energy production and various industrial processes, its environmental costs—such as greenhouse gas emissions and ecological harm from mining—pose significant challenges. Evaluating these factors helps in understanding the trade-offs involved and highlights the need for sustainable practices.",
