    "correct_answer": "The process involves placing a cylindrical object such as a log or roller under heavy machinery. As the machinery is pushed or pulled, the log rotates, converting sliding friction—with a high coefficient—into rolling friction, which is much lower because the actual deformation and contact area are reduced. For instance, moving a large engine block on rollers greatly decreases the force required compared to dragging it, demonstrating principles of energy conservation, contact mechanics, and efficient force distribution.",
    "explanation": "This answer should detail the physics behind friction reduction through rolling. It involves discussing how a smaller contact area and the rotation of the rollers minimize frictional force, making the work easier.

    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed by taking two identical flat objects (like hardcover books) where one is directly slid across a table and the other is rolled on a set of cylindrical objects (like pencils or rollers). The procedure involves measuring the force needed to move the book in both cases using a spring scale. Expected observations include a lower force reading when the book is rolling rather than sliding, which illustrates that rolling friction is significantly less than sliding friction.",
