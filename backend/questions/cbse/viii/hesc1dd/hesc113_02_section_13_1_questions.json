    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For an object to be visible, it must either emit light or reflect light from a source. When this light reaches our eyes, it passes through structures like the cornea and lens and gets focused on the retina. The retina converts the light into electrical signals, which are processed by the brain to form an image. Examples include a glowing light bulb (emitting light) and a painted wall (reflecting light).",

    "correct_answer": "Objects that emit light, such as the Sun or a light bulb, produce their own light, making them visible regardless of the surrounding lighting conditions. In contrast, objects that reflect light, like a tree or a book, depend on an external light source. Our eyes receive both types of light in similar ways—light enters the eye and is focused on the retina—but the origin of the light is different. For instance, while a glowing LED works in complete darkness, a painted surface requires an external light source to be seen.",
