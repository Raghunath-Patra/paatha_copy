    "correct_answer": "Noise refers to unpleasant sounds that cause discomfort, such as the sounds from construction sites or busy traffic. Musical sound, on the other hand, is pleasing to the ear and is produced by musical instruments like the harmonium or sitar. However, the interpretation of any sound depends on context and volume. For instance, a sound that is musical at a low to moderate volume may turn into noise if it is too loud or if it occurs in a disruptive environment like a classroom where all students talk simultaneously.",

    "correct_answer": "Environmental noise like construction sounds can cause stress, reduce concentration, and affect overall mood and productivity. The constant disturbance may lead to difficulties in communication and learning, especially in educational settings. To mitigate these effects, measures such as using soundproof windows, implementing noise barriers around construction sites, scheduling noisy operations during less disruptive times, and promoting the use of earplugs or headphones in high-noise areas can be effective.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Sound perception is highly subjective and can vary greatly among different individuals and cultures. What one person finds pleasant, another might find irritating, depending on personal experiences, cultural background, and even the context in which the sound is heard. For example, a sound that is traditionally considered musical in one culture might be interpreted as noise in another if it disrupts the ambient environment. Additionally, an individual's mood, concentration levels, and sensitivity to sound can also influence this perception.",
