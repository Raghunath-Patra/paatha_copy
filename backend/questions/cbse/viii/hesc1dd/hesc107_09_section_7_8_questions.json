    "correct_answer": "Insect hormones, such as ecdysone and juvenile hormone, regulate the timing of metamorphosis by initiating processes like molting and the shift from larval to adult forms. In the absence of proper hormonal signaling, insects may not molt correctly, leading to incomplete development or death.",
    "explanation": "Ecdysone promotes molting and transformation, while the balance with juvenile hormone controls whether the insect continues larval growth or transitions to an adult stage. Disruption in these signals can lead to developmental abnormalities.",

    "correct_answer": "Frogs rely on thyroxine produced by the thyroid gland for metamorphosis, and its production depends on the availability of iodine in water. In contrast, insects use hormones like ecdysone and juvenile hormone to control molting and metamorphosis. The regulation in frogs is dependent on an external mineral (iodine), whereas in insects, a balance of internal hormonal levels determines the progression from larva to adult.",
    "explanation": "This answer highlights both the similarities in using hormones for developmental transformation and the differences in the types of hormones and their regulatory mechanisms. While frogs are affected by environmental iodine levels, insects have internal hormonal balances that dictate their metamorphic processes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Iodised salt is critical in the human diet because iodine is essential for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine. Thyroxine plays a major role in regulating metabolism, growth, and development. Without sufficient iodine intake, individuals are at risk of developing goitre, hypothyroidism, and metabolic disorders. Using iodised salt is an effective public health measure to ensure adequate iodine intake and prevent these conditions.",
    "explanation": "Linking the requirement of iodine in both human health and amphibian metamorphosis underscores the universal significance of iodine. By adding iodine to salt—a common dietary staple—public health initiatives help maintain normal thyroid function and overall metabolic health.",
