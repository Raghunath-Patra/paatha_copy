    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "First, take a used ballpen refill and rub it vigorously with a piece of polythene. During this rubbing process, electrons are transferred from one material to the other depending on their electron affinity. As a result, one material (typically the refill) becomes charged due to an excess or deficiency of electrons, while the polythene acquires the opposite charge. When the charged refill is brought near small lightweight objects like pieces of paper, the electric field of the charged refill causes a redistribution of charges (via electrostatic induction) in the neutral paper, leading to an attractive force between the refill and the paper.",
    "explanation": "This explanation outlines the steps involved in the charging process by rubbing. It highlights the electron transfer mechanism, the role of electron affinity, and how the subsequent electric field interacts with nearby neutral objects to produce observable static effects.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Insulators, such as plastic or rubber, do not permit free movement of electrons; therefore, when they are charged by friction (rubbing), the transferred electrons remain localized, allowing the object to retain the static charge. In contrast, conductors, like metals, allow electrons to flow freely, which means any excess charge is quickly dispersed, often through the body or onto the ground. For instance, a plastic comb charged by rubbing with dry hair can attract small pieces of paper because it maintains its charge, while a steel spoon, even if rubbed similarly, tends to lose any charge rapidly due to its conductive nature.",
    "explanation": "The response emphasizes how material properties influence the retention of static charges. Insulators prevent electron movement, so they hold a static charge effectively, whereas conductors allow electrons to redistribute quickly, leading to dissipation of the static effect.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed by first gathering various household objects such as a used ballpen refill, balloon, eraser, and a steel spoon, along with different rubbing materials like polythene, woollen cloth, dry hair, and wool. The experimental setup would involve isolating each object on an insulating surface and then systematically rubbing them with the designated materials. The procedure would include: 1) Rubbing each object with the chosen material for a set duration and intensity. 2) Bringing the object close to small pieces of paper to observe attraction. 3) Recording which objects become charged and which do not. Safety measures include ensuring dry conditions to prevent accidental electrical discharge and avoiding direct contact with the charged parts to prevent charge leakage. The results, such as observing that insulators remain charged and attract paper while conductors do not, would confirm the principles of static electricity and charge retention.",
