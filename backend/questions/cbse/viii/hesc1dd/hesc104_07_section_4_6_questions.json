    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "No fuel is ideal because each potential fuel has limitations when weighed against various requirements. While a fuel might be readily available or cost-effective, it may not burn cleanly or may only produce moderate heat. For instance, wood is cheap and widely available but produces smoke and residue, whereas petrol burns efficiently but is expensive and less sustainable. The optimal choice depends on balancing factors like cost, ease of combustion, heat output, and environmental impact for the intended use.",
    "explanation": "This response examines the inherent trade-offs in fuel properties. The concept of an 'ideal' fuel is compromised by factors such as economic constraints, efficiency, environmental impact, and specific application needs.

Pollution control measures include the use of catalytic converters, scrubbers, and filters in combustion processes to minimize toxic emissions. Additionally, alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, or biogas, which are cleaner and renewable, can provide sustainable energy solutions while reducing environmental impact.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One can design an experiment using a simple calorimeter. For example, select wood (solid fuel) and kerosene oil (liquid fuel). Materials needed include a calorimeter, thermometer, measuring cylinder, electronic balance, and a stand to hold the fuel. The procedure involves weighing a fixed amount of each fuel, burning them under controlled conditions in a calorimeter containing a known mass of water, and measuring the temperature rise. The heat produced (using Q = m × c × ΔT, where m is mass of water, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change) per unit weight of the fuel can then be calculated to compare efficiencies. Control variables such as air flow and initial water temperature must be maintained for accuracy.",
    "explanation": "This experiment requires knowledge of calorimetry and controlled scientific methods. By accurately measuring the energy released from the combustion of each fuel, one can objectively compare their heating efficiencies.
