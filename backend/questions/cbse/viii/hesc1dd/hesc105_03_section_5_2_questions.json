    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Desertification is the process by which fertile land becomes desert. Deforestation accelerates this process by removing the protective tree cover, which increases soil erosion. This erosion strips the fertile topsoil, leaving behind less fertile and often rocky material that is not conducive to plant growth.",
    "explanation": "Without trees, the soil loses its organic layer and humus, crucial for retaining nutrients. The lack of vegetation leads to increased runoff and erosion, thereby progressively reducing soil fertility and leading to desert conditions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Deforestation affects the water cycle in multiple ways: it reduces transpiration from trees which ordinarily contributes moisture to the atmosphere, thereby reducing rainfall and increasing the likelihood of droughts. At the same time, fewer trees mean less interception of rainfall and protection against soil erosion, so water runs off the land more quickly, which can result in floods.",
    "explanation": "Trees play a critical role in the water cycle through transpiration. With reduced tree cover, less water is recycled into the atmosphere, leading to lower rainfall. Moreover, the absence of a root network makes soils more susceptible to erosion, reducing water infiltration and causing quicker and larger runoff during heavy rains.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Deforestation reduces the number of trees available to absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) during photosynthesis. The basic chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. With fewer trees, more CO₂ remains in the atmosphere. Since CO₂ is a potent greenhouse gas, it traps infrared radiation which increases the Earth's surface temperature. This enhancement of the greenhouse effect is a core factor in global warming.",
    "explanation": "The reduction in photosynthetic capacity due to fewer trees means that excess CO₂ accumulates. In the atmosphere, CO₂ absorbs and re-emits infrared energy, trapping heat that would otherwise escape into space. This results in an overall rise in global temperatures, further disturbing various climate patterns, such as the water cycle, and exacerbating extreme weather events.",

    "correct_answer": "False. Deforestation decreases the water infiltration rate, which increases surface runoff and the risk of floods.",
