    "correct_answer": "Adolescent pregnancy poses significant risks to both the mother and child. Due to the incomplete physical and mental development in teenagers, complications such as low birth weight, premature birth, and increased maternal mortality are more common. Early marriage, which often leads to adolescent motherhood, also limits educational and employment opportunities for young women, exacerbating economic and social challenges. These factors compound to create long-term health and wellness issues for both the mother and the child.",
