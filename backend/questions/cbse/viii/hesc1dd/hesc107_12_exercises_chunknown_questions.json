    "correct_answer": "Adolescence is a transitional stage of physical, mental, and emotional development that occurs between childhood and adulthood, generally beginning around 11 years and lasting up to 18 or 19 years of age. This period is marked by rapid growth, the onset of puberty, and the development of secondary sexual characteristics.",
    "explanation": "Adolescence involves significant physiological and psychological changes, including growth spurts, hormonal changes, and the development of sexual maturity. It is a crucial period for learning and adjustment as the individual prepares for adult life.",

    "correct_answer": "Menstruation is the periodic shedding of the uterine lining that occurs in females as part of the menstrual cycle. It typically occurs once every 28 to 30 days starting from menarche (the first menstrual period) until menopause. If the released egg from the ovary is not fertilized, the thickened inner lining of the uterus, which had prepared for pregnancy, is shed accompanied by blood and other materials.",
    "explanation": "Menstruation is a natural process controlled by reproductive hormones. The cycle involves the maturation and release of an egg, the thickening of the uterus lining (endometrium), and its subsequent breakdown in the absence of fertilization. This process ensures the uterus is renewed each cycle and is ready for a potential pregnancy.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "At puberty, several changes take place in the body including a sudden increase in height due to the elongation of long bones, changes in body shape (broader shoulders in boys, widening of hips in girls), development of secondary sexual characteristics (such as facial hair and deepening of voice in boys; breast development in girls), development of sex organs (testes and penis in boys; ovaries and uterus in girls), increased activity of sweat and sebaceous glands, and overall hormonal changes that prepare the body for reproduction.",
    "explanation": "Puberty involves endocrine changes that trigger growth spurts, development of reproductive organs, and other secondary characteristic changes. These changes are largely driven by hormones such as testosterone in boys and estrogen in girls.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sex hormones are hormones secreted by the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) that regulate the development of secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive functions. They are named 'sex hormones' because they are directly involved in the differentiation of the sexes and the maturation of the reproductive system. In males, testosterone is the primary sex hormone responsible for the development of features such as facial hair and a deep voice, while in females, estrogen and progesterone are key in developing breasts and regulating the menstrual cycle.",
    "explanation": "The production of sex hormones is controlled by hormones from the pituitary gland. These hormones not only regulate reproductive functions but also influence various secondary sexual characteristics, ensuring that the body is properly organized for reproduction.",
