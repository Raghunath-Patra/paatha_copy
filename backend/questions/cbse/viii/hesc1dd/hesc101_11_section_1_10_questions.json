    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both animal husbandry and crop production follow systematic processes that start with selection and preparation. In crop production, the process involves selecting quality seeds, sowing, fertilizing, irrigating, and harvesting; similarly, animal husbandry involves selecting healthy animals, providing them with proper food, housing, and care, and then managing their reproduction and health for the production of food. While one deals with plants and the other with animals, both require planned inputs and management practices to achieve a successful yield of food products.",
    "explanation": "This explanation draws a parallel between the two types of food production. Both require proper planning, resource management, and execution of a series of steps aimed at maximizing yield and quality – be it of crops or animal products. Building this comparison enhances the understanding of agricultural practices as interconnected systems.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Proper nutrition, shelter, and health care are essential for ensuring that animals remain healthy, grow optimally, and produce high-quality food products. Good nutrition strengthens the immune system and enhances the quality of milk, eggs, and meat. Adequate shelter protects animals from extreme weather and predators, while proper health care, including regular vaccinations and veterinary check-ups, prevents diseases. Together, these factors help maintain consistency and improve the safety, taste, and overall nutritional value of animal-derived foods.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that the welfare of animals is directly linked to the quality of food products they yield. In both intensive and small-scale farming, managing these factors efficiently leads to better health of the animals and, consequently, higher quality and more nutrient-rich products, which is critical for food security and consumer health.",

    "correct_answer": "First, select two groups of the same species and similar initial health status. Group A will receive a standard diet while Group B receives a nutritionally enriched diet. Control variables such as housing, space, and health care for both groups. Record daily feed intake, weight gain, and overall health measures (e.g., activity levels and incidence of illness) over a fixed period. Analyze the data statistically to determine if any significant differences exist between the two groups. This approach minimizes external variability and highlights the impact of nutrition on growth rates.",
