    "correct_answer": "In Activity 9.1, the book was pushed from opposite directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) and in both cases, despite the different directions of the applied force, the book traveled a short distance before stopping.

    "correct_answer": "The friction between two surfaces depends on factors such as surface roughness and the materials involved. Rougher surfaces tend to have more irregularities, which increase friction, while smoother surfaces have fewer asperities and usually result in lower friction. The type of materials and any surface treatments also play a role in the magnitude of the frictional force.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Friction acts opposite to the applied force because it is the reactive force that arises at the interface of two surfaces in contact. For an object in motion to slow down and eventually stop, the net force acting on it must be zero or negative relative to its motion. Friction provides this counteracting force, ensuring that the applied force is offset by an opposing force so that the object decelerates.",
    "explanation": "When forces are applied, the net force determines the acceleration. In the presence of friction opposing the applied force, the net force is either reduced or becomes negative, thereby decelerating the object.",

    "correct_answer": "In Activity 9.1, you gently push a book on a table from one direction and observe that it travels a short distance before stopping. Then, you repeat the experiment by pushing the book from the opposite direction, and the outcome is the same—the book stops after moving a little distance. This experiment shows that no matter which direction the book is pushed, an opposing force—friction—acts to decelerate and eventually stop the book.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's First Law states that an object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Friction is a key external force that is often not immediately visible but acts continuously between surfaces in contact. Even after the initial push, friction opposes the object's motion, reducing its speed until it eventually stops. This behavior demonstrates the concept of inertia as explained by Newton's First Law, showing that without a balancing force like friction, the motion would persist.",
    "explanation": "Newton's First Law, sometimes called the law of inertia, requires an external force to change the state of motion. Friction is that external force that eventually stops objects, reinforcing the idea that motion cannot continue indefinitely in the presence of friction.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An ideal experiment would involve using a flat object (like a book) and several different surfaces with varying known roughness (e.g., smooth glass, rough sandpaper, polished wood). Materials include a consistent weight object, surfaces with different textures, a measuring tape, and a timer. The procedure is as follows: (1) Place the book on each surface, (2) Give it a consistent initial push, (3) Measure the distance traveled until it stops for each surface. Independent variable: surface roughness; dependent variable: distance the book travels; controlled variables: weight of the book, push force, and environmental conditions. The expected outcome is that on rougher surfaces, the book will travel a shorter distance due to a higher frictional force, while on smoother surfaces, it will travel further.",
    "explanation": "The experiment illustrates the relationship between surface properties and friction. By systematically varying the surface texture and controlling other factors, one can observe how the frictional force changes, thereby confirming that roughness increases friction.",
