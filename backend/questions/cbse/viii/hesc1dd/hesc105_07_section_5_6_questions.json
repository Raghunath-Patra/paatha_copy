    "correct_answer": "Habitat destruction reduces the area available for species to live, reproduce, and find food, leading to a decline in biodiversity. Endemic species, which exist only in specific regions, are particularly vulnerable because they have nowhere else to go. This can result in reduced population sizes, genetic diversity, and ultimately, the risk of extinction, thereby affecting ecosystem stability.",
    "explanation": "A strong answer must explain that destructive human activities reduce available habitats, intensify competition for scarce resources, and fragment ecosystems—each of which disproportionately impacts species with limited distributions.
