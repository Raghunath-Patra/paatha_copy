    "correct_answer": "Sexual reproduction in animals involves the union of sperm and egg cells from two parents to form a zygote. This process leads to genetic variation because each parent contributes half of the genetic material, creating a unique combination. For example, the human baby develops from a fertilized egg formed by the fusion of gametes, incorporating traits from both parents.",
    "explanation": "The process of fertilization and subsequent development allows for a mix of genetic traits, which can result in variation among the offspring. This genetic diversity is crucial for adaptation and evolution in a changing environment.",

    "correct_answer": "Sexual reproduction involves two parents and the fusion of their gametes, which increases genetic diversity. This diversity is an advantage in adapting to environmental changes though it requires finding a mate and typically is more energy-consuming. Asexual reproduction, on the other hand, involves a single parent and produces genetically identical offspring, which is efficient and rapid. However, the lack of genetic variation can be a disadvantage in changing conditions because it offers little opportunity for adaptation.",
    "explanation": "The key differences revolve around genetic variation and the required biological investment. Sexual reproduction generates greater genetic diversity, potentially leading to evolutionary advantages, but it is more complex and resource-intensive. Asexual reproduction is simpler and faster but may limit long-term adaptability due to uniformity in the gene pool.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Using the human baby as an example: The process begins with the fertilization of the egg by sperm to form a zygote. This zygote undergoes multiple divisions to form an embryo, which then develops into a fetus as specialized cells and tissues form. The fetus gradually matures, and ultimately, a baby is born. Throughout this process, the developing organism does not resemble the fully formed baby at first; major anatomical structures are differentiated later as the development proceeds.",
    "explanation": "Embryonic development is a complex and gradual process. Initially, the embryo is a cluster of undifferentiated cells, and as development progresses, specific tissues and organs form. This gradual development explains why the early stages bear little resemblance to the final, mature form of the organism.",
