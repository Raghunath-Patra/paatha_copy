    "correct_answer": "It is important because touching the charged refill with your hand can neutralize or alter its charge due to the conductivity of the human body, which can lead to erroneous observations.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Charging by friction involves rubbing two objects together, which causes electrons to be transferred from one object to the other. In Activity 12.3, when both balloons are rubbed with a woollen cloth, they acquire the same charge and hence repel one another, demonstrating that like charges repel. Similarly, when two refills rubbed with polythene are brought near each other, they repel due to carrying the same charge. However, when a charged balloon interacts with a charged refill, the observation of attraction (as noted in the text) suggests that the two objects carry opposite charges, thereby illustrating the principle that unlike charges attract.",
    "explanation": "This detailed process shows how friction causes electrons to be transferred, leading to observable forces between objects. The experiments demonstrate two fundamental electrostatic principles: like charges repel and unlike charges attract.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Static electricity is generated when charges accumulate on the surface of objects, typically caused by friction (such as rubbing a balloon with wool). In contrast, an electric current is a flow of charges through a conductor, as seen in electrical circuits powering appliances. Static electricity is observed in everyday phenomena like hair standing up or small sparks when touching a metal object, whereas electric current is used in lighting, heating, and powering devices. The generation of static electricity involves the transfer of electrons between objects, while electric current involves a continuous, directional movement of electrons driven by a potential difference.",
    "explanation": "This comparison highlights the differences in charge movement and applications. Static electricity is transient and localized, often resulting from simple interactions such as friction, whereas electric current is controlled and harnessed for practical applications in technology and daily life.",
