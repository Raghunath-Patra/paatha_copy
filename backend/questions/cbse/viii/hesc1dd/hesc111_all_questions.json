Acids, bases, and salts ionize in water, releasing free ions that facilitate electrical conduction. In contrast, sugar dissolves in water but does not ionize into charged particles; thus, its solution remains a poor conductor of electricity.",
    "explanation": "The conduction of electricity in solutions is dependent on the presence of ions. For acids like HCl, the dissociation reaction is HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻. For bases like NaOH, the reaction is NaOH → Na⁺ + OH⁻. Salts dissociate similarly. In contrast, sugar (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁) simply dissolves without dissociation, resulting in a lack of free ions and poor conductivity.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Activity 11.3, a wire is coiled around a matchbox tray, and a compass is placed inside the coil. When an electric current flows through the wire (even a weak one), it produces a magnetic field that causes the compass needle to deflect. This method is more sensitive than relying solely on the glowing of a bulb, which may not respond well to weak currents. An LED is advantageous because it can emit light at lower currents due to its lower threshold voltage, making it a more reliable indicator of conductivity in cases where the electric current is very weak.",
    "explanation": "The deflection of a compass needle is directly related to the magnetic field generated by the current through the coil. This sensitivity allows for the detection of even small currents. LEDs, by their design, require less current to operate than traditional bulbs, providing a clear visual cue even with minimal current flow.",

    "correct_answer": "Electroplating occurs when an electric current is passed through an electrolyte containing dissolved metal ions—in this case, copper sulphate in water. At the cathode (negative electrode), copper ions (Cu²⁺) are attracted and gain electrons (reduction) to form solid copper (Cu), which deposits onto the electrode. The reaction at the cathode is: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). At the anode (positive electrode), the solid copper metal loses electrons (oxidation) and forms copper ions, thus dissolving into the solution. The reaction at the anode is: Cu(s) → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻. This continuous process results in the deposition of copper on the cathode while maintaining a constant concentration of copper ions in the solution as copper from the anode is replenished.",

    "question_text": "Evaluate the usefulness of the discovery made by Boojho and Paheli regarding the greenish blue spot for practical applications. What are some potential real-world applications of this observation?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The discovery can be used as a simple method to identify the positive terminal of a battery in situations where the battery is concealed. This can be particularly useful in troubleshooting circuits, verifying battery orientation, or in educational demonstrations. Additionally, the principle behind the observation may be extended to develop low-cost sensors or indicators based on the chemical effects produced by electric current in various materials.",
    "explanation": "The practical significance lies in the observation that the positive terminal consistently produces a visible change. By exploiting this predictable reaction, engineers and educators can design simple diagnostic tools. The application also exemplifies the importance of serendipity in scientific discovery, where an unexpected result leads to useful practical insights.",

    "question_text": "True or False: The bubbles observed at both electrodes during the electrolysis experiment are always composed of the same gas.",
    "type": "True/False",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "False. The bubbles are composed of different gases; hydrogen is produced at the negative electrode and oxygen (or sometimes chlorine, depending on the solute) is produced at the positive electrode.",
    "explanation": "In the electrolysis of water, for example, hydrogen gas is evolved at the cathode due to the reduction of water, and oxygen gas is produced at the anode through oxidation. The type of gas may vary with the composition of the solution.",

    "question_text": "True or False: The cleaning of the metal caps of the carbon rods is necessary in the experiment to ensure that they participate effectively in the electrochemical reactions. If false, explain why.",
    "type": "True/False",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "True. Cleaning the metal caps removes any insulating materials like tarnish or oxide films, ensuring efficient electrical contact and participation in the electrochemical reactions.",
    "explanation": "Effective cleaning ensures that the electrodes provide a good conductive surface for the reactions to occur. Any impurities could hinder the transfer of electrons, affecting the overall efficiency of the electrolysis process.",
