    "correct_answer": "A growth spurt is a period of rapid physical growth that typically occurs during early adolescence, around the age of 10 to 11. It is characterized by sudden increases in height and weight and is driven by hormonal changes in the body. This spurt marks the beginning of significant developmental changes which, alongside the development of secondary sexual characteristics, indicates the transition from childhood to adulthood.",
    "explanation": "During a growth spurt, hormones such as growth hormone, testosterone, and estrogen play key roles. The rapid change in body size helps prepare the adolescentâ€™s body for further changes required for reproductive maturity. Understanding this process helps contextualize why adolescence is a critical developmental period.",

    "correct_answer": "Puberty leads to reproductive maturity by initiating a series of hormonal and physical changes. In boys, this includes an increase in muscle mass, deepening of the voice, growth of facial and body hair, and enlargement of the testes, which contribute to the body's ability to produce sperm. In girls, puberty brings about breast development, widening of the hips, and the initiation of menstrual cycles, preparing the body for potential pregnancy. These changes are collectively known as secondary sexual characteristics, which signal that both sexes have reached a level of maturity enabling reproduction.",
    "explanation": "This complex process is regulated by hormones such as testosterone in boys and estrogen in girls. The emergence of secondary sexual characteristics alongside the primary changes in the reproductive system marks the culmination of puberty and the attainment of reproductive capability. This transition is crucial for the continuation of the species and has significant biological, social, and psychological implications.",
