    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The plane mirror reflects the incoming white sunlight, directing it towards the bowl of water. As the light passes through the water, it is refracted because water has a different refractive index than air. This refraction causes the light waves to bend at different angles depending on their wavelengths. Shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) bend more than longer wavelengths (like red). Thus, the white light is spread out into its constituent colours, a phenomenon known as dispersion. The resulting spectrum is then projected onto a surface, demonstrating that white light is a mixture of multiple colours.",
    "explanation": "The process involves both reflection (by the mirror) and refraction (by the water). The differing degrees of bending for each wavelength cause the light to spread out into a spectrum. This experiment mimics the natural occurrence of dispersion that is also seen in rainbows.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both the experiment and a rainbow rely on the principle of dispersion of light. In the experiment, white light is split into its constituent colours using a combination of reflection by the mirror and refraction by the water. Similarly, a rainbow is formed when sunlight is refracted, dispersed, and then reflected inside water droplets in the atmosphere. The similarity lies in the separation of light into a spectrum of colours due to refraction and dispersion. The difference is in the setup: the experiment uses a controlled apparatus of a mirror and a bowl of water, whereas a rainbow forms naturally in the atmosphere with innumerable water droplets and involves both refraction and internal reflection within each droplet.",
    "explanation": "The mechanism of both processes is based on the same principles of refraction and dispersion. However, the environmental conditions and geometric arrangements differ, making the rainbow a more complex natural phenomenon influenced by factors such as the sun's angle and droplet size.",
