    "explanation": "The action focuses on pulling the water upward. Pushing, in this scenario, would not achieve the same effect due to the physics of lifting a mass against gravity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Force and motion are interrelated: when a force (push or pull) is applied to an object, it changes the state of motion of that object. For example, when a ball is kicked (a push), it accelerates and moves; when water is drawn from a well (a pull), the bucket moves upward. These examples illustrate that force is the cause of motion or change in motion.",
    "explanation": "This answer emphasizes that force is responsible for initiating and altering motion. Every time an object moves differently—from start, stop, or change in direction—a force is at work, whether it's pushing or pulling. This fundamental principle is evident in everyday actions and experiments described in the activity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Classifying actions as pushes and pulls simplifies the analysis of various physical activities by showing that most changes in the state of motion are due to one or both of these types of forces. For instance, in Table 8.1, actions such as opening a door involve either a push or pull, and moving a loaded cart can involve both. This classification provides a systematic way to understand that any interaction causing movement is essentially a force, which is crucial in scientific analyses.",
    "explanation": "The answer should highlight that breaking down physical actions into pushes and pulls allows us to identify the force at work in every instance of motion—and thus understand broader concepts such as Newton's laws of motion. Real-world examples, such as door operations and sports actions, reinforce this approach by connecting theory with observable phenomena.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be designed using a small toy car, a ramp, and a set of weights. Set the ramp at a slight angle and place the toy car at the top. First, observe the car moving down the ramp without any additional force. Then, gently push the car at the start as it begins its descent, noting the increase in speed. Finally, pull the car back up using a string attached to its front. Expected observations include the car accelerating when pushed and requiring additional energy when pulled upward against the direction of motion. This experiment demonstrates that applying a force alters the object’s motion.",
    "explanation": "The experiment uses everyday objects to illustrate how forces (pushes and pulls) affect motion. It shows that without an applied force, the car moves solely by the effect of gravity, but when a push or pull is added, the motion changes accordingly. This reinforces the principle that force is the cause of any change in motion.",
