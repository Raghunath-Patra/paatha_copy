    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a dark room, without any light source, objects cannot be seen because our eyes require light to reflect off objects. Similarly, objects outside the room cannot be seen if no light is available to enter the room or reflect from them. Visible images are created only when light from objects reaches our eyes.",
    "explanation": "Human vision depends on light. In the absence of light (dark room), objects remain unseen even though they may be present. This principle is fundamental to understanding that sight is based on the reflection or emission of light from objects into the eye.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Regular reflection occurs on smooth surfaces (like a mirror) where the incident rays reflect in a parallel and predictable manner, forming clear images. Diffused reflection occurs on rough surfaces where the incident light is reflected in many directions due to irregularities. However, in diffused reflection the laws of reflection still apply at each point – it is the irregular surface that causes the scattered appearance.",
    "explanation": "In regular (specular) reflection, the incident ray, reflected ray, and the normal lie in the same plane and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, leading to predictable, clear images. In diffused (irregular) reflection, although the same laws of reflection hold locally, the micro-irregularities on the surface cause the reflected rays to scatter, preventing the formation of a clear image.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Polished Wooden Table: Regular reflection, if it is sufficiently smooth; (b) Chalk Powder: Diffused reflection due to granular, rough texture; (c) Cardboard Surface: Diffused reflection since it is rough; (d) Marble Floor with Water: Regular reflection because the water creates a smooth reflective layer; (e) Mirror: Regular reflection as it is designed to reflect light uniformly; (f) Piece of Paper: Diffused reflection because paper is not a smooth, reflective surface.",
    "explanation": "Regular reflection requires a smooth, polished surface that reflects rays in a single direction following the law of reflection, resulting in clear images. Diffused reflection occurs on rough surfaces where micro-irregularities cause reflected rays to scatter. Each material’s surface characteristics determine the type of reflection observed.",

    "explanation": "In a plane mirror, the image appears as far behind the mirror as the object is in front, thus an object at 1 m appears 2 m away from the viewer. The mirror laterally inverts images, so touching the left ear appears as if the right ear is being touched by the corresponding opposite hand. In dim light, the pupil dilates (increases in size) to allow more light in, and nocturnal birds have a higher number of rods (light-sensitive cells) than cones (colour-sensitive cells), meaning they have fewer cones.",

Coloured glass pieces or small objects are placed on the glass plate, and a ground glass plate is used to secure them. When you look through the small viewing hole and rotate the kaleidoscope, multiple reflections between the inclined mirrors create intricate and symmetrical patterns.",
    "explanation": "The construction of a kaleidoscope involves the principles of multiple reflections.

    "correct_answer": "Using the law of reflection, the ray incident at 30° (with respect to the normal) on the first mirror reflects off making an angle of 30°. When this ray strikes the second mirror (which is perpendicular to the first), you use the reflected angle and draw the corresponding reflected ray from the second mirror so that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection at that mirror as well.",
    "explanation": "This problem requires constructing a diagram. First, draw the incident ray meeting the first mirror at a 30° angle to the normal. After reflection, the ray meets the second mirror. Then, by applying the law of reflection at the second mirror (angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection), the path of the final reflected ray is determined.
