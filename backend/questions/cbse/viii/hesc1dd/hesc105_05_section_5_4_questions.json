    "correct_answer": "Biosphere reserves help conserve biodiversity by integrating various types of protected areas under one umbrella, ensuring that different ecosystems and species are safeguarded. For example, the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve includes Satpura National Park, Bori Sanctuary, and Pachmarhi Sanctuary, each providing specific habitats and protection measures that work together to maintain overall biodiversity. These areas also promote research, education, and sustainable development, balancing human needs with conservation goals.",
    "explanation": "The explanation includes how combining different protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, provides comprehensive conservation of both flora and fauna. With multiple layers of protection and management, biosphere reserves serve as effective models for preserving ecological and cultural diversity while also promoting sustainable practices.",

    "correct_answer": "Urbanisation and industrialisation can lead to habitat destruction, pollution, and fragmentation, which in turn reduce the diversity of species in an area. Mitigation strategies include implementing strict pollution control measures, enforcing wildlife protection laws, promoting afforestation, and planning urban development in ways that minimize habitat fragmentation. Additionally, promoting sustainable development practices and raising community awareness about biodiversity conservation are key.",
