    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the tumbler is struck gently, the ball is displaced only slightly, indicating a small amplitude. When struck hard, a larger displacement of the ball indicates a larger amplitude of vibration.",
    "explanation": "The displacement of the thermocol ball serves as a measure of the amplitude of vibration. A gentle strike produces a smaller displacement and hence a lower amplitude, while a hard strike results in a larger displacement indicating a higher amplitude, which correlates to louder sound.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Striking the tumbler harder increases the amplitude of its vibration. Since loudness is proportional to the square of the amplitude, the energy delivered to the sound wave increases significantly, resulting in a louder sound that can be measured in a higher decibel (dB) level.",
    "explanation": "A harder strike causes the tumbler to vibrate with greater amplitude. Because the loudness of sound is proportional to the square of the amplitude, even a small increase in amplitude results in a much larger increase in the energy and hence the sound's loudness. This relationship is quantified by the decibel scale, which is used to express the loudness of sound.",

    "correct_answer": "Frequency determines the pitch of a sound. A higher frequency results in a high-pitched sound while a lower frequency produces a low-pitched sound. For instance, a bird's chirp or a whistle, which have higher frequencies, produce high-pitched sounds. In contrast, the roar of a lion or the sound of a drum, which involve lower frequencies, result in low-pitched sounds.",
    "explanation": "The pitch of a sound is directly linked to the frequency of vibration. A high frequency means that there are more oscillations per second, which our ears interpret as a high pitch. Conversely, a low frequency means fewer oscillations per second, leading to a low pitch. Examples include musical instruments like a whistle (high frequency and high pitch) and a drum (low frequency and low pitch), as well as natural sounds like a bird chirping versus a lion roaring.",
