In Fig. 8.3, the examples of two girls pushing or pulling each other and the man pulling a cow with a rope illustrate that during each interaction, forces are exchanged between the objects involved. These examples highlight that whenever objects interact, they experience forces that can result in motion if the forces overcome opposing forces such as friction.",

In each case, the interaction between objects results in the exertion of force that drives motion. These interactions are significant because they show that forces are not inherent properties of single objects but are created when objects interact.",
