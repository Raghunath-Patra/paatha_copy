    ],
    "correct_answer": "B: Fertilisers are manufactured inorganic salts, while manure is an organic substance from the decomposition of plant and animal wastes.",
    "explanation": "Fertilisers are chemically prepared in factories, and although they are rich in specific plant nutrients, they lack the organic matter or humus provided by manure, which is naturally decomposed.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C: Growing different crops alternately. This practice particularly helps when legumes are included since they fix nitrogen in the soil.",

    "correct_answer": "Manure is an organic substance obtained from the natural decomposition of plant or animal waste, which supplies nutrients along with humus, improves soil texture, and increases microbial activity. Fertilisers are man-made inorganic salts produced in factories that are rich in specific nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, but they do not add organic matter to the soil.",
    "explanation": "Manure enhances the overall soil structure and fertility by providing organic matter and promoting beneficial soil microbes.

    "correct_answer": "Continuous cultivation depletes essential mineral nutrients from the soil, making it less fertile, which ultimately leads to weak plant growth and reduced crop yield.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In this experiment, moong or gram seeds are germinated to produce three similar sized seedlings. Three identical glasses are labeled A, B, and C. Glass A is filled with soil mixed with cow dung manure, glass B with soil and urea (a chemical fertiliser), and glass C contains only soil. After planting the seedlings and watering them equally, observations are made after 7-10 days. Typically, seedlings in glass B show the fastest and best growth due to the specific nutrient boost from urea, glass A shows moderate growth owing to the organic benefits of manure, and glass C shows poor growth due to lack of added nutrients. The experiment demonstrates that both manure and fertiliser provide essential nutrients for plant growth, with fertilisers typically promoting faster short-term growth.",
    "explanation": "This experiment helps students visually compare the role of different nutrient sources. It underscores the fact that while chemical fertilisers can lead to rapid growth due to their concentrated nutrient content, organic manure contributes to long-term soil health by improving texture and water retention.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Excessive chemical fertiliser use can lead to a reduction in soil fertility over the long term because it does not enhance the organic content of the soil. The lack of humus impairs soil structure, water retention, and the activity of beneficial microorganisms. Additionally, nutrient runoff from overuse of fertilisers contributes to water pollution, causing eutrophication in aquatic systems. Sustainable practices to mitigate these effects include substituting chemical fertilisers with organic manure to improve soil texture and microbial activity, practicing crop rotation (especially using nitrogen-fixing legumes), and implementing fallow periods to allow the soil to recover naturally.",
    "explanation": "Chemical fertilisers provide a quick nutrient boost but fail to improve the overall organic matter in the soil. Over time, this deteriorates soil structure, increasing the risk of environmental pollution. Integrating organic manuring, crop rotation, and fallow periods forms a more balanced approach to soil nutrient management, enhancing both productivity and environmental sustainability.",
