    "correct_answer": "The classification into Kharif and Rabi crops is significant because it allows farmers to plan their sowing and harvesting schedules around the seasonal climatic conditions, ensuring that each crop is grown under its ideal weather conditions for optimal yield.",
    "explanation": "By categorizing crops based on the season they are best suited for, farmers can align their agricultural practices with the natural climatic rhythms such as the rainy season for Kharif crops and the winter season for Rabi crops.",

    "correct_answer": "Climatic factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall vary from region to region in India. These variations determine which crops will grow best in a particular area; for example, regions with high rainfall are more favorable for Kharif crops while cooler, drier regions support Rabi crops.",
    "explanation": "The diversity in climate across India means that agricultural practices need to be tailored to each region's specific weather patterns. This ensures that the crops selected can rely on the natural environmental conditions for better growth and yield.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Early humans originally led nomadic lives, moving from place to place in search of food, shelter, and water. Over time, as they discovered that certain plants could be cultivated and animals could be domesticated, they began to settle in one place. This led to the development of agriculture, where people grew specific crops like rice and wheat on large, cultivated fields. This transition provided a stable food supply and laid the foundation for the rise of settled communities and advanced civilizations.",
    "explanation": "The transition from a nomadic lifestyle to agriculture was revolutionary. It involved understanding plant life cycles, learning to cultivate the land, and managing crops and livestock. This gave rise to organized farming practices that allowed human societies to flourish and progress.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Seasonal variations in India, characterized by differences in temperature, humidity, and rainfall, directly influence the cropping patterns across the country. During the rainy season (June to September), farmers sow Kharif crops such as paddy, maize, and soyabean, which require abundant water. In the winter season (October to March), Rabi crops like wheat and gram are grown as these crops are better suited to cooler and drier conditions. Additionally, in some areas, pulses and vegetables are cultivated during the summer. By aligning crop choices with the local climate, farmers are able to optimize growth conditions, reduce risks of crop failure, and maximize yield.",
    "explanation": "The diverse climatic conditions in India require farmers to adopt a flexible approach to agriculture. Understanding the timing and requirements of each season allows for efficient use of resources and improved productivity. This adaptation is crucial for food security and the economic stability of farming communities.",
