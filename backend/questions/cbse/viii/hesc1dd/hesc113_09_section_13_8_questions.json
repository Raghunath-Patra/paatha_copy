    "correct_answer": "When experiencing eyestrain, first ensure that the lighting is appropriate (not too bright or too dim). Then, take regular breaks while reading to relax your eyes and maintain the proper reading distance. If the discomfort continues, consult an eye specialist.",
    "explanation": "Proper lighting prevents excessive strain from insufficient or overly bright light. Regular breaks reduce the continuous load on the eye muscles, and maintaining a proper reading distance ensures that the eyes are not forced into an unnatural position.

    "correct_answer": "Dietary deficiencies, particularly in Vitamin A, have a significant impact on eye health. Vitamin A is essential for the formation of rhodopsin in the retina, enabling vision in low light. Deficiencies in Vitamin A, due to a lack of Vitamin A-rich foods like raw carrots, green vegetables, or cod liver oil, can lead to night blindness and other eye problems.",
    "explanation": "Without enough Vitamin A, the retina cannot produce adequate rhodopsin, the pigment needed for vision in dim settings.
