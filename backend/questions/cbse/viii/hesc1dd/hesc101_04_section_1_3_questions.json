    "correct_answer": "Tilling (or ploughing) refers to the process of turning and loosening the soil before sowing crops. It is critical because it aerates the soil, allows deeper root penetration, brings nutrient-rich topsoil to the surface, and helps mix in organic matter like manure, which collectively supports healthy plant growth.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process begins with tilling (or ploughing), which involves turning and loosening the soil to improve aeration and allow deeper root penetration. This step also brings nutrient-rich soil from below the surface to the top, enhancing nutrient availability. The incorporation of manure before tilling further enriches the soil by adding organic matter and essential nutrients. After tilling, levelling is carried out to break large soil clumps and to create a smooth, even surface. This ensures uniform sowing of seeds and proper irrigation. Together, these steps create a conducive environment for plant growth by ensuring well-aerated, moisture-retentive, and nutrient-dense soil.",
    "explanation": "Each step in the soil preparation process plays a crucial role. Tilling enhances soil structure and nutrient distribution, manure provides organic enrichment, and levelling ensures effective sowing and irrigation.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Adding manure before tilling integrates organic matter thoroughly into the soil, which improves soil fertility and structure. It aids in retaining moisture, supports the population of beneficial soil organisms, and accelerates the decomposition process that releases additional nutrients. In contrast, tilling dry soil without manure might leave it lacking in essential nutrients and organic matter, potentially affecting crop growth and yield adversely.",
    "explanation": "Manure enriches the soil with nutrients, while the tilling process ensures even distribution and adequate aeration. This synergy not only facilitates better moisture retention and nutrient availability but also improves the overall biological activity in the soil, creating a more robust environment for crop development.",
