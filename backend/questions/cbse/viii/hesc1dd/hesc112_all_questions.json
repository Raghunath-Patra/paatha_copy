When the charge difference becomes large enough, a small spark or discharge occurs, which is heard as a crackling sound.",
    "explanation": "Friction between materials (such as a sweater and hair/clothes) results in the transfer of electrons, causing one object to become negatively charged and the other positively charged.

    "explanation": "To reduce the risk of injury during lightning storms, it is important to avoid being in open areas or near objects that can attract lightning.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "Two charged balloons repel each other because they carry like charges, which, according to Coulomb’s law, experience a repulsive force. In contrast, when one balloon is charged and the other is uncharged, the uncharged balloon may undergo electrostatic induction, wherein a redistribution of charges occurs to create an induced opposite charge on the side nearest to the charged balloon, resulting in an attractive force.",
    "explanation": "When similar charges are present on two objects (for instance, both negatively charged), the repulsive force between like charges causes them to push away from each other. However, if one object is uncharged, bringing a charged object close to it induces a separation of charges within the uncharged object. The side nearest to the charged object accumulates opposite charge, leading to an attractive interaction. This demonstrates basic electrostatic principles and induction.",

    "correct_answer": "The instrument is called an electroscope. It typically consists of a metal rod attached to a conductive metal leaf (or two thin foils) enclosed in a container. When a charged object touches the metal rod, charge is transferred to the leaves, causing them to repel each other. A diagram should show a jar or container with a cardboard lid, a paper clip inserted through the lid with two suspended aluminum foil strips.",
    "explanation": "An electroscope works on the principle of charge repulsion. When a charged vessel (or rod) transfers charge to the metal leaves, the like charges repel, causing the leaves to move apart. The extent of divergence can indicate the magnitude of the charge.

Their design involves a metallic rod that is taller than the building, with its upper end exposed to the air and the lower end buried deep in the ground. This configuration takes advantage of the principles of electrical conductivity and the path of least resistance, providing a preferential route for the lightning’s electrical charge to safely dissipate into the earth. Additionally, elements such as metal columns, electrical wires, and water pipes, though secondary, also contribute to protection when not touched. Overall, the design minimizes potential damage to structural and electrical systems.",
    "explanation": "The efficacy of lightning conductors is grounded in their ability to channel high-voltage electrical energy directly to the ground, bypassing more vulnerable parts of a building.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the electroscope experiment, when a charged object (like a charged refill) touches the metal paper clip, electrons are transferred via conduction. The paper clip, because it is a good conductor, allows the free movement of charge into the metal structure of the electroscope. As the charge flows, it reaches the aluminum foil strips attached to the clip. Since both strips now have the same type of charge, they repel each other. This separation of the strips indicates that the electroscope is charged. Materials like metal are chosen because their high conductivity ensures that the transfer of charge is rapid and uniform.",
    "explanation": "This process demonstrates the principle of conduction, where charge moves directly through a conductive path.

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the electroscope is charged, a charged object transfers a net charge to the metallic paper clip, and subsequently, to the attached foil strips. Both strips acquire the same type of charge and repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion. In contrast, when the paper clip is touched with a hand, earthing occurs; charge is transferred from the electroscope to the earth (or vice versa), neutralizing the electroscope’s charge. As a result, the repulsion between the foil strips diminishes or disappears, and they return to their original, closely aligned position.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the state of charge. Charge induction by a charged object results in observable divergence of the strips, demonstrating repulsion. When discharged via earthing, the absence of excess charge means no repulsive forces act between the strips.

Materials: Jam jar, cardboard, paper clip, aluminum foil strips (4 cm × 1 cm), charged object (e.g., a charged refill), and an uncharged object. Procedure: 1) Construct the electroscope by placing the paper clip through the hole in the cardboard lid and attaching the strips so they hang down inside the jar. 2) Bring the charged object into contact with the top end of the paper clip. 3) Observe whether the foil strips diverge. 4) Repeat with the uncharged object. Expected observations: When a charged object is used, the foil strips will repel and spread apart due to the transfer of charge through conduction. With an uncharged object, there will be no significant movement of the strips. Explanation: The divergence of the strips confirms charge transfer due to the conductive properties of the metals. Conversely, if no movement is observed, the object is likely uncharged. This experiment effectively uses the principle of charge detection via the behavior of an electroscope.",

    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment is to take a plastic comb and a piece of wool. First, comb the hair vigorously with the plastic comb for about 30 seconds to transfer electrons from the hair to the comb.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The formation of a lightning strike begins with the movement of air and water droplets inside a thunderstorm. As warm air rises and water droplets fall, a separation of charges occurs. Positive charges accumulate at the top of the cloud due to the upward motion and charge separation, while negative charges gather at the bottom. This separation creates a large potential difference not only within the cloud but also between the cloud and the ground (where positive charges can be induced). When the electric field becomes strong enough to overcome the insulating properties of air, the air becomes ionized and conducts electricity, leading to a rapid discharge of electricity in the form of lightning, accompanied by sound (thunder).",

    "correct_answer": "Tectonic plates are large fragments of the Earth's crust that are constantly in motion due to forces in the mantle. When these plates interact at their boundaries—whether by colliding (subduction), sliding past each other (transform boundaries), or moving apart (divergent boundaries)—stress builds up in the Earth's crust. When this stress is released suddenly, it causes a shaking of the ground known as an earthquake. This sudden release generates seismic waves that travel through the Earth, which are recorded by instruments such as seismographs.",

    "correct_answer": "First, take a used ballpen refill and rub it vigorously with a piece of polythene. During this rubbing process, electrons are transferred from one material to the other depending on their electron affinity. As a result, one material (typically the refill) becomes charged due to an excess or deficiency of electrons, while the polythene acquires the opposite charge. When the charged refill is brought near small lightweight objects like pieces of paper, the electric field of the charged refill causes a redistribution of charges (via electrostatic induction) in the neutral paper, leading to an attractive force between the refill and the paper.",

    "correct_answer": "Insulators, such as plastic or rubber, do not permit free movement of electrons; therefore, when they are charged by friction (rubbing), the transferred electrons remain localized, allowing the object to retain the static charge. In contrast, conductors, like metals, allow electrons to flow freely, which means any excess charge is quickly dispersed, often through the body or onto the ground. For instance, a plastic comb charged by rubbing with dry hair can attract small pieces of paper because it maintains its charge, while a steel spoon, even if rubbed similarly, tends to lose any charge rapidly due to its conductive nature.",
