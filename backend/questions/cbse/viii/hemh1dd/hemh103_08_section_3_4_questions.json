Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, and it is also a parallelogram, which implies that diagonals bisect each other (OA = OC and OB = OD). Consider triangles AOB and COD. Using side congruence (OA = OC, OB = OD, and AB = CD as all sides are equal), we conclude ∆AOB ≅ ∆COD by the SSS criterion. Since corresponding angles in congruent triangles are equal and angles AOB and COD form a linear pair summing to 180°, each must be 90°. Thus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Show that in a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other. Step 2: Establish congruence between appropriate triangles using SSS (since all sides of the rhombus are equal).

    "correct_answer": "Take a square sheet (e.g., PQRS). First, fold the paper along one diagonal, then unfold. Next, fold along the other diagonal and unfold. The intersection point of the folds is the midpoint of both diagonals. To verify perpendicularity, use a set-square to check the angle at the intersection; it should be 90°. This confirms that the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other since they both cut each other in half and meet at a right angle.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Fold along the diagonals of the square and observe the crease intersections, identifying the midpoint.
