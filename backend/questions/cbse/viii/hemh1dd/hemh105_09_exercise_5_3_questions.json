    "correct_answer": "(i) 9, (ii) 6, (iii) 9, (iv) 5",
    "explanation": "A perfect square has a unique square root whose units digit depends on the last digits of the number. (i) Since 99² = 9801, the one's digit is 9. (ii) 316² = 99856 so the unit digit is 6. (iii) 999² = 998001, therefore the one’s digit is 9. (iv) A perfect square ending in 25 always comes from a number ending in 5; hence the square root ends in 5.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "√100 = 10 and √169 = 13",
    "explanation": "The method of repeated subtraction uses the fact that the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n². For 100: subtract successive odd numbers (1, 3, 5, …) until the remainder is 0; this takes 10 steps, so √100 = 10. Similarly, for 169, 13 consecutive odd numbers must be subtracted to reach 0, implying √169 = 13.",
