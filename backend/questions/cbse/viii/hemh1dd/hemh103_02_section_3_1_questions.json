    "correct_answer": "A polygon where every line segment joining two interior points lies entirely within it",
    "explanation": "A convex polygon is defined by the property that any line segment connecting any two points inside the polygon lies entirely within the polygon. This means that all its interior angles are less than 180° and none of its diagonals exit the boundary.",

Assume a convex polygon, which means for any two points within the polygon, the line segment connecting them lies inside the polygon. By selecting two non-adjacent vertices, their connecting line is by definition a diagonal. Since these vertices are inside the polygon and the polygon is convex, the entire diagonal must lie within the polygon. Thus, every diagonal of a convex polygon lies fully inside it.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Begin with the definition of a convex polygon. Step 2: Choose any two vertices (non-adjacent) within the convex polygon. Step 3: By the convexity property, the line segment connecting these vertices (the diagonal) lies completely inside the polygon.

    "correct_answer": "A quadrilateral can be equilateral but not equiangular; for example, a rhombus has all sides equal but its angles are not all equal unless it is a square. On the other hand, in a triangle, if it is equilateral (all sides equal), it must also be equiangular (all angles equal), with each angle measuring 60°.",
    "explanation": "For quadrilaterals, consider the rhombus: it has four sides of equal length but its angles can vary, making it non-equiangular unless all angles are 90° (which makes it a square). For triangles, the equality of all three sides forces the equality of all three angles by the Isosceles Triangle Theorem and the angle sum property of triangles. Therefore, an equilateral triangle is inherently equiangular.",
