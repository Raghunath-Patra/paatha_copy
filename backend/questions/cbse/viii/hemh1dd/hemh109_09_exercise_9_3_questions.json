    "correct_answer": "(a) Volume, (b) Surface Area, (c) Volume",
    "explanation": "For a cylindrical tank, volume is used to determine capacity (how much liquid it can hold) while surface area is relevant when you need to cover or plaster the outer surface (for example, determining the number of cement bags required). Therefore, (a) and (c) involve volume computations, and (b) involves surface area.",

    "question_text": "Diameter of cylinder A is 7 cm and its height is 14 cm. Diameter of cylinder B is 14 cm and its height is 7 cm. Without doing any calculations can you suggest whose volume is greater? Then verify it by finding the volume of both cylinders and check whether the cylinder with greater volume also has a greater surface area.",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Cylinder B has a greater volume and also a greater surface area. Calculations: For Cylinder A (r = 3.5 cm, h = 14 cm), Volume = π × (3.5²) × 14 ≈ π × 12.25 × 14 ≈ 171.5π. For Cylinder B (r = 7 cm, h = 7 cm), Volume = π × (7²) × 7 = π × 49 × 7 = 343π. Surface area for Cylinder A = 2πr(r+h) ≈ 2π×3.5×(3.5+14) = 7π×17.5 = 122.5π, and for Cylinder B = 2π×7×(7+7) = 2π×7×14 = 196π.",
    "explanation": "Initially, by comparing dimensions, one might observe that although Cylinder B has a height which is half that of Cylinder A, its diameter is doubled, causing the cross-sectional area (πr²) to be quadrupled. Hence, without calculation, Cylinder B is expected to have a greater volume. On calculating: \nFor Cylinder A: r = 3.5 cm so V = π×(3.5)²×14 = π×12.25×14 ≈ 171.5π cm³. \nFor Cylinder B: r = 7 cm so V = π×(7)²×7 = π×49×7 = 343π cm³. \nSimilarly, the surface area calculations using SA = 2πr(r + h) show that Cylinder B also has a larger surface area. This demonstrates that in this instance, the cylinder with greater volume also has a greater surface area.",

Knowing that 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³, we have: \nV = 1.54 m³ = 1,540,000 cm³.\nStep 2: Diameter of the base is 140 cm, hence the radius r = 70 cm.\nStep 3: Use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr²h. \nSolve for h: h = V/(πr²) = 1,540,000 ÷ (π × 70²) = 1,540,000 ÷ (π × 4900).\nStep 4: Calculate: 1,540,000 ÷ 4900 ≈ 314.29, and then h ≈ 314.29 ÷ π ≈ 100 cm.\nThus, the height is approximately 100 cm (or 1 m).",
