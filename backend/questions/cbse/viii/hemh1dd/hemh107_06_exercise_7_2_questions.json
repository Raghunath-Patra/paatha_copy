    "question_text": "During a sale, a shop offered a discount of 10% on the marked prices of all the items. What would a customer have to pay for a pair of jeans marked at ₹1450 and two shirts marked at ₹850 each?",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "₹2835",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Calculate the sale price for the jeans. The discount on the jeans is 10% of ₹1450 which is 0.10 × 1450 = ₹145. So, the sale price for the jeans is 1450 - 145 = ₹1305. \nStep 2: Calculate the sale price for each shirt. The discount on one shirt is 10% of ₹850 which is 0.10 × 850 = ₹85. Therefore, the sale price per shirt is 850 - 85 = ₹765. \nStep 3: For two shirts, the total cost is 2 × ₹765 = ₹1530. \nStep 4: Add the cost of jeans and shirts: ₹1305 + ₹1530 = ₹2835.",
