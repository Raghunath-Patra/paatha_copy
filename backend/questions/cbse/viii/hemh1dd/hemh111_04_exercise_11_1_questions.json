    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "No, the parking charges are not in direct proportion to the parking time.",
    "explanation": "For direct proportion, the ratio of charge to time must remain constant. Here, for 4 hours the ratio is 60/4 = 15, for 8 hours it is 100/8 = 12.5, for 12 hours it is 140/12 ≈ 11.67, and for 24 hours it is 180/24 = 7.5. Since these ratios are not equal, the charges are not directly proportional to the parking time.",

    "correct_answer": "8, 32, 56, 96, 160 respectively.",
    "explanation": "Since the ratio of red pigment to base is 1:8, for any given quantity of red pigment, the base required is 8 times that quantity. Therefore, for 1 part: 1×8 = 8; for 4 parts: 4×8 = 32; for 7 parts: 7×8 = 56; for 12 parts: 12×8 = 96; for 20 parts: 20×8 = 160.",

    "explanation": "For a square, the perimeter P = 4L; hence, L/P = L/(4L) = 1/4, a constant ratio, indicating direct proportion. However, the area A = L², so the ratio L/A = L/(L²) = 1/L, which varies with L.
