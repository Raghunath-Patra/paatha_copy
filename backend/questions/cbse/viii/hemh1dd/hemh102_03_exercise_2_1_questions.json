    "correct_answer": "x = 0",
    "explanation": "First, expand the right-hand side: 3(x – 1) + 7 becomes 3x - 3 + 7 = 3x + 4. The equation now is 8x + 4 = 3x + 4. Subtract 3x + 4 from each side to obtain 5x = 0, and hence x = 0 when divided by 5.",

    "correct_answer": "x = 10",
    "explanation": "Multiply the entire equation by 15 (the LCM of 3 and 15) to remove fractions: 15×(2x/3) + 15×1 = 15×(7x/15) + 15×3, which simplifies to 10x + 15 = 7x + 45.
