    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) 1 : 2, (b) 1 : 2000, (c) 1 : 10.",
    "explanation": "For part (a): The speed ratio is 15 km/hr to 30 km/hr, which simplifies to 15/30 = 1/2, so the ratio is 1 : 2. For part (b): Convert 10 km to meters: 10 km = 10 × 1000 = 10,000 m. The ratio becomes 5 m : 10,000 m, which simplifies to 5/10,000 = 1/2000, so the ratio is 1 : 2000. For part (c): Convert ₹5 to paise (1 rupee = 100 paise): ₹5 = 500 paise, so the ratio is 50 paise : 500 paise, which simplifies to 50/500 = 1/10, hence the ratio is 1 : 10.",

    "explanation": "For a ratio a:b, the percentage for the first part is (a/(a+b))×100% and for the second part (b/(a+b))×100%. For (a) 3:4, the total parts = 3 + 4 = 7. The percentages are (3/7)×100 ≈ 42.86% and (4/7)×100 ≈ 57.14%. For (b) 2:3, the total parts = 2 + 3 = 5. The percentages are (2/5)×100 = 40% and (3/5)×100 = 60%.",

    "explanation": "First, total percentage = 100%. Given 60% like cricket and 30% like football, the remaining percentage for other games = 100% - (60% + 30%) = 10%. Now, calculate the numbers: Cricket lovers = 60% of 50,00,000 = 0.60 × 50,00,000 = 30,00,000; Football lovers = 30% of 50,00,000 = 0.30 × 50,00,000 = 15,00,000; Others = 10% of 50,00,000 = 0.10 × 50,00,000 = 5,00,000.",
