    "correct_answer": "If x and y are directly proportional, then by definition x = ky, where k is constant. For any two pairs (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), we have x₁ = k y₁ and x₂ = k y₂, so x₁/y₁ = k and x₂/y₂ = k, proving x₁/y₁ = x₂/y₂. For example, with a car travelling at a constant speed, if it covers 60 km in 4 liters of petrol then the ratio (60/4 = 15 km per liter) remains constant. So, if 8 liters are used, the distance travelled is 8 × 15 = 120 km.",
    "explanation": "The key idea is the constant ratio k. Since both pairs (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) equal k when divided appropriately, the ratio remains unchanged.

This formula is exponential in nature (due to the power n) and not linear. Thus, while simple interest is given by SI = (P × r × n)/100, which shows direct proportion with time, the computed compound interest increases exponentially as n increases. Therefore, compound interest does not vary directly with time.",
    "explanation": "In simple interest, the interest earned every period is constant, hence SI ∝ n. However, in compound interest, the interest is added to the principal for the calculation of interest in the subsequent periods, leading to an exponential growth represented by the factor (1 + r/100)ⁿ.
