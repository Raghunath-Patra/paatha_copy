    "explanation": "A perfect square is obtained when an integer is multiplied by itself. Because of the multiplication rules for the units digits (for example, 2×2 = 4; 3×3 = 9), only specific digits appear in the units place of perfect squares.

    "correct_answer": "If a number ends with n zeros (meaning it is divisible by 10ⁿ), then its square will be divisible by 10^(2n), resulting in 2n zeros at the end. The squaring process doubles the number of factors of 10 (i.e., both factors contribute a set of zeros), which is why the resulting square always has an even number of zeros at the end.",
    "explanation": "For example, if a number is written as k×10³, then its square is k²×10⁶, meaning the squared number ends with 6 zeros. This doubling of the exponent on 10 confirms that square numbers always have an even number of trailing zeros when the original number ends with zeros.",
