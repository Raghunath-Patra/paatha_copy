    "question_text": "Name the property under multiplication used in each of the following: (i) -4/5 × 1 = 1 × -4/5 = -4/5, (ii) -13/17 × -2/7 = -2/7 × -13/17, (iii) -19/29 × 29/-19 = 1.",

    "correct_answer": "(i) Multiplicative Identity Property; (ii) Commutative Property; (iii) Multiplicative Inverse Property.",
    "explanation": "For (i), multiplying any number by 1 leaves the number unchanged, which is the multiplicative identity property. For (ii), the order of factors is switched without affecting the product, demonstrating the commutative property of multiplication. For (iii), a number multiplied by its reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) gives 1, hence the multiplicative inverse property.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Associative Property.",
    "explanation": "The associative property of multiplication states that when multiplying three or more numbers together, the way in which the factors are grouped does not affect the product. Thus, grouping 1/3 and 6 first and then multiplying by 4/3 yields the same result as grouping 6 and 4/3 first.",
