    "correct_answer": "For (a), the outcomes are A, B, C, D, and A appears twice indicating that the wheel has two sectors labelled A. If we consider distinct outcomes, they are A, B, C, D. For (b), the outcomes when tossing two coins are: HH, HT, TH, TT.",
    "explanation": "For experiment (a), list every outcome as marked on the spinner. Note that the letter A appears twice, which may be considered as two separate occurrences depending on the context. For (b), each coin has two possible outcomes (Head or Tail) and when two coins are tossed together, the total number of outcomes is 2Ã—2 = 4. These outcomes are: HH, HT, TH, TT.",

    "explanation": "A standard die has six faces numbered 1 to 6. For part (i), identify the prime numbers: 2, 3 and 5 (note that 1 is not considered prime), and thus the non-prime outcomes are the remaining numbers: 1, 4, and 6.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "(a) The probability is 1/5 because there are 5 outcomes on the spinner and only one is D. (b) The probability of getting an ace is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13. (c) The probability of getting a red apple is 3/7, since there are 3 red apples out of a total of 7 apples.",
    "explanation": "For (a), the spinner has 5 outcomes (noting that one sector, A, appears twice but still counts as a separate outcome instance), hence the probability for any one specified outcome (in this case D) is 1 divided by 5. For (b), in a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 aces. Therefore, the probability = 4/52 = 1/13. For (c), the total number of apples is 4 + 3 = 7. The event 'drawing a red apple' has 3 favorable outcomes.
