    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "By taking two identical 3–4–5 right triangles and joining them along the hypotenuse (5 cm) one can form a trapezium. Different arrangements, such as rotating one of the triangles or using their set-square cutouts, can yield trapeziums with different pairs of parallel sides. The non-parallel (leg) lengths and the base lengths may vary while still maintaining one pair of parallel sides.",
    "explanation": "When two congruent triangles are arranged with their hypotenuses joined, one obtains a quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides. Experimenting with rotations and repositioning of additional instruments (like set-squares) can produce other trapezium configurations. The exercise highlights that while the triangles are congruent, their arrangement affects which sides become parallel and whether the non‐parallel sides are equal (forming an isosceles trapezium).",

    "explanation": "Step 1: Draw the diagonal AC in parallelogram ABCD, dividing it into triangles ABC and CDA. Step 2: By the properties of parallel lines, the angles at vertices A and C are equal to their corresponding alternate interior angles. Step 3: Since AC is common to both triangles, by the ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) postulate, the triangles are congruent.

    "correct_answer": "Proof: In parallelogram ABCD, let the consecutive angles be ∠A and ∠B. Since AB ∥ CD and AD ∥ BC, use the properties of parallel lines with a transversal. For transversal AD, ∠A and the angle at vertex D are interior angles and hence supplementary. Additionally, by congruence of triangles via a drawn diagonal, one can deduce that ∠A + ∠B = 180°. Thus, adjacent angles are supplementary.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Consider parallelogram ABCD. Draw diagonal AC if necessary to form triangles. Step 2: Note that the lines forming the adjacent angles are cut by the transversal (for example, side AD with AB). Therefore, the pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal add up to 180° (linear pair). Step 3: This logically shows that ∠A + ∠B = 180°. A similar argument applies to the other adjacent angles, proving they are all supplementary.",
