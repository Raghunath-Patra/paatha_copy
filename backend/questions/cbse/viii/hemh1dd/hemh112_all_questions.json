For example, the number 30 can be factored into primes as 2 × 3 × 5. Suppose there exists another distinct factorization into primes; through the application of the uniqueness property of prime numbers, one would reach a contradiction because primes have no other divisors apart from 1 and themselves. Thus, the prime factors 2, 3, and 5 are uniquely determined for 30. This reasoning holds in general because any two distinct prime factorizations would imply a prime number divides a product in two incompatible ways, violating the definition of a prime.",
