However, having all sides equal in a trapezium would force both pairs of opposite sides to be parallel, thereby making it a parallelogram (specifically, a rhombus if all sides are equal).",
    "explanation": "Step 1: For a trapezium to have all angles equal, each angle must be 90° because 4×90° = 360°. This condition essentially turns the trapezium into a rectangle (if it meets the definition of having only one pair of parallel sides) or even a square if all sides are equal.\nStep 2: A trapezium with all sides equal would no longer fit the general definition of a trapezium, since having all sides equal typically implies that both pairs of opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram (specifically, a rhombus if the angles are not 90°, or a square if they are).\nStep 3: Therefore, while a trapezium might have equal angles in a special case (and be a rectangle), having all sides equal would transform its classification to that of a parallelogram, not a typical trapezium.",

Since one or more diagonals lie outside, it is a concave polygon (and not convex).\n\nFigure (2): It is a simple curve and a simple closed curve, qualifies as a polygon. All diagonals lie entirely within the shape; hence it is a convex polygon (and not concave).\n\nFigure (3): The drawing consists of two separate circles. Since the figure is not drawn as a single continuous curve, it is not a simple curve, and therefore it is not a simple closed curve, nor is it a polygon.\n\nFigure (4): The star polygon is drawn as a continuous closed curve so it is a simple closed curve (assuming it does not retrace any portion apart from the joining point). It qualifies as a polygon. Because parts of its diagonals or the connecting segments lie outside the figure, it is classified as a concave polygon rather than a convex one.\n\nFigure (5): Though the curve is closed, it is not simple (it has self-intersections). Therefore, it does not qualify as a simple curve or a simple closed curve, and consequently it is not considered a polygon in the classic sense.\n\nFigure (6): Similar to Figure (5), it is a closed curve with self-intersections. Hence it is not a simple curve or a simple closed curve, and it is not a polygon.\n\nFigure (7): This is an open curve (not closed). Although it may be simple (assuming no retracing or self-intersection), because it is not closed, it is not a polygon.\n\nFigure (8): The image shows two circles connected by a line.

A polygon is defined as a simple closed curve that consists only of line segments. For convex polygons, every line segment connecting any two interior points lies entirely within the polygon. For concave polygons, there exists at least one line segment between two interior points that passes outside the polygon.

    "correct_answer": "Answers (based on standard parallelogram properties):\n(i) Since adjacent angles are supplementary and opposite angles equal, if ∠B = 100° then ∠D = 100° and ∠A = ∠C = 80°. Thus, x = 80°, y = 100°, and z = 80°.\n(ii) If one interior angle is 50°, its adjacent angle must be 130° (since 50° + 130° = 180°). Then by the property of opposite angles, the remaining interior angle is 50°. The exterior angle adjacent to a 50° interior angle is 130°. Thus, one set of answers is: x = 130°, y = 50°, and z = 130°.\n(iii) Using the properties of a rhombus (opposite angles equal and adjacent angles supplementary) and given two angles 30° and 90°, one would normally set up equations from the fact that the sum of angles is 360°. (This part requires a careful reading of the diagram; one potential solution is to assign the unknowns so that the angles satisfy 30° + 90° + x + y = 360° with x = y = 120°, though the diagram’s configuration may lead to a different unique answer.)\n(iv) For an interior angle of 80°, the adjacent angle must be 100° (since 80° + 100° = 180°). Then the opposite angle is 80° and its adjacent exterior angle is 100°. Thus, a possible answer is: x = 100°, y = 80°, and z = 100°.\n(v) When a diagonal is drawn, relationships from the congruency of triangles can be used along with the fact that the sum of interior angles is 360°. (The precise answers for x, y, and z depend on the exact layout shown in the diagram; use properties such as opposite angles equal and adjacent angles supplementary to solve the equations.)",
    "explanation": "In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal and consecutive angles are supplementary. For (i) if one angle is 100°, then its adjacent angles are 80° since 180° – 100° = 80°. For (ii) the given interior angle of 50° forces its adjacent angle to be 130°, and by opposite equality the remaining angles are determined. In parts (iii)–(v), additional relationships provided by diagonals (e.g. bisection and the congruence of triangles created by the diagonal) are used. Note that some parts require interpretation of a diagram; set up equations based on the sum of angles in a quadrilateral (360°) and use the properties of a parallelogram.",

    "correct_answer": "(i) Not necessarily. Although in a parallelogram adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180°), the condition ∠D + ∠B = 180° alone does not guarantee that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.\n(ii) No; in a parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides must be equal. Here AD ≠ BC, so the quadrilateral cannot be a parallelogram.\n(iii) No; because in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Since 70° ≠ 65°, ABCD cannot be a parallelogram.",
    "explanation": "For (i), while it is true that in a parallelogram any two consecutive angles are supplementary, having just one pair of angles summing to 180° is not sufficient to conclude a quadrilateral is a parallelogram because other conditions (like both pairs of opposite sides being equal or parallel) must also be met. For (ii), the equality of opposite sides (AB = DC and AD = BC) is necessary. The given side lengths violate this since 4 ≠ 4.4.
