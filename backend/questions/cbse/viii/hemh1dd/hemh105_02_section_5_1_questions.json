    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A number m is considered 'perfect' or a perfect square when it can be expressed as m = n² because it is the area of a square with side length n. This representation uniquely manifests the geometric property that multiplying a number by itself produces a symmetrical result, which has both arithmetic and visual significance in mathematics.",
    "explanation": "Expressing a number as n² inherently connects it to geometric squares. The uniqueness comes from the fact that only numbers that arise from the product of a natural number with itself possess factors that appear in pairs, and this structurally defines the sequence of square numbers.",

Since 2n is even for any natural number n, adding 1 results in an odd number. Thus, the difference between consecutive perfect squares is always an odd number.",
    "explanation": "Proof:\n1. Expand (n + 1)²: (n + 1)² = n² + 2n + 1.\n2. Subtract n²: (n + 1)² − n² = (n² + 2n + 1) − n² = 2n + 1.\n3. Observation: For any natural number n, 2n is even; therefore, 2n + 1 is odd. This concludes that the gap between successive perfect squares is always an odd number.",

Compute the difference: (n + 1)² − n² = 2n + 1.\nImplications:\n- The result 2n + 1 shows that as n increases, the increment between successive squares increases linearly.\n- This explains why the gap between perfect squares grows larger as we progress through natural numbers, affecting their distribution.",
