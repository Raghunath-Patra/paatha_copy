    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Probability is used in real-life predictions by analyzing a representative sample or historical data to estimate and forecast future events. In exit polls, a small group of voters' choices is used to predict election results, assuming that the sample accurately reflects the larger population. Similarly, weather forecasts are made by using historical weather data to identify trends, which help in predicting future weather conditions. The reliability of these predictions relies on how representative the sample is and how well past data predicts current outcomes.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: For exit polls, data is collected from a sample that reflects the voting population, and probability principles help extrapolate these results to determine overall voting patterns. Step 2: In weather forecasting, long-term historical data is analyzed to recognize patterns and trends. Step 3: These data-driven approaches employ probability theory to quantify uncertainties, enhancing the reliability of predictions in both fields.",
