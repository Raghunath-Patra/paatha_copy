    "explanation": "The key idea is aligning the powers of 10. In this example, converting 5.97 × 10²⁴ into a form comparable with 7.35 × 10²² yields 597 × 10²², which when added to 7.35 × 10²² gives the sum. Always ensure the exponents match before adding.",

    "explanation": "Step 1: Divide the coefficients: 1.4 ÷ 1.2756 ≈ 1.098. Step 2: Subtract the exponents: 9 - 7 = 2, meaning multiplying by 10². Therefore, the ratio is about 1.098 × 10² which equals approximately 110. This shows that the Sun’s diameter is about 110 times that of the Earth.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A number in standard form is given as a × 10ⁿ. When n is negative, 10ⁿ equals 1 / 10^|n|, which implies division by a power of 10. For 7.54 × 10⁻⁴, this means 7.54 / 10⁴. Dividing by 10⁴ moves the decimal point four places to the left in reverse, resulting in a number less than 1: 0.000754.",
    "explanation": "The proof relies on the definition of negative exponents: 10⁻⁴ = 1/10⁴. Thus, 7.54 × 10⁻⁴ = 7.54 / 10⁴. Division by 10⁴ means shifting the decimal 4 places to the left if you were converting a large number, but for numbers less than 1, it makes the number even smaller by introducing zeros after the decimal.
