    "correct_answer": "Division of algebraic expressions is the process of determining how many times one expression (the divisor) is contained in another (the dividend). Cancellation of common factors is important because it simplifies the expressions by removing factors common to both the numerator and denominator, ultimately making the division process more manageable.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To prove, consider the polynomial P(y) = 4y³ + 5y² + 6y. Dividing by 2y term by term: 4y³ ÷ 2y = 2y², 5y² ÷ 2y = (5/2)y, and 6y ÷ 2y = 3. Hence, P(y) ÷ 2y = 2y² + (5/2)y + 3. This shows that since the division is distributive over addition, dividing each term by the monomial gives the correct result.",
    "explanation": "Division of a polynomial by a monomial leverages the distributive property: (a + b + c) ÷ d = a÷d + b÷d + c÷d, provided d ≠ 0. By applying this property, we see that each term is individually simplified, yielding an overall simplified expression.",

Factor it out: 24(x²yz + xy²z + xyz²) = 24xyz(x + y + z). Now, dividing by 8xyz cancels the 8xyz factor, giving 3(x + y + z). Thus, the method involves factorizing to isolate common factors and then canceling them in the division process.",

Step 3: Cancel the common factor 8xyz from numerator and denominator: (24/8)(x + y + z)= 3(x + y + z).
