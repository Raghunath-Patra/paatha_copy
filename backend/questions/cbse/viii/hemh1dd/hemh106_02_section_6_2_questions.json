    "explanation": "Consider the prime factorization of a number N: if each prime factor appears in groups of three (i.e., N = p₁^(3a) × p₂^(3b) × … × pₖ^(3c)), then we can write N as (p₁^a × p₂^b × … × pₖ^c)³.

To form a perfect cube the volume must have each prime factor to an exponent that is a multiple of 3. Since the factor 2 is only to the first power, we need to provide two additional 2’s (i.e., multiply by 2² = 4) so that the new product becomes (2³) × (3³) × (5³).
