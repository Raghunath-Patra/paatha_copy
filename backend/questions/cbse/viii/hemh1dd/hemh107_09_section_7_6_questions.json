    "correct_answer": "Depreciation refers to the decrease in the value of an asset over time, typically due to wear and tear, age, or obsolescence.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To derive the compound interest formula, observe that after one year, the amount is A₁ = P(1 + r/100). In the second year, this amount earns interest, so A₂ = A₁(1 + r/100) = P(1 + r/100)². Continuing this process, after t years, the amount becomes A = P(1 + r/100)^t. This formula demonstrates that, in the context of population growth, the population at the end of t years can be calculated by treating the initial population as P and the growth rate per annum as r, applying the same compounding principle.",
    "explanation": "Start with an initial principal P. After one year, the interest added is r% of P, giving us P(1 + r/100). For each subsequent year, the new principal includes the previous year's accumulated interest, so the growth factor multiplies again. Repeating for t years yields A = P(1 + r/100)^t.

    "correct_answer": "Proof: Let the initial value be P. After one year, the value is V₁ = P - (r/100)P = P(1 - r/100). After the second year, the asset loses r% of V₁, giving V₂ = V₁(1 - r/100) = P(1 - r/100)². Continuing this pattern, after n years, the value is Vₙ = P(1 - r/100)^n, which completes the proof.",
    "explanation": "The proof is by induction. For n = 1, the value is P(1 - r/100), which is true. Assume it's true for n = k, i.e., Vₖ = P(1 - r/100)^k. For n = k + 1, the value becomes Vₖ₊₁ = Vₖ(1 - r/100) = P(1 - r/100)^k(1 - r/100) = P(1 - r/100)^(k+1). Thus, by mathematical induction, the expression holds for all natural numbers n.",
