    "explanation": "By calculating the squares of digits 0 through 9, we observe that: 0² = 0, 1² = 1, 2² = 4, 3² = 9, 4² = 16 (units digit 6), 5² = 25, 6² = 36 (units digit 6), 7² = 49 (units digit 9), 8² = 64 (units digit 4), and 9² = 81 (units digit 1).

    "correct_answer": "Examining only the units digit can rule out numbers that end in 2, 3, 7, or 8 as perfect squares. However, if a number ends with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9, it can be a perfect square or not.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "If a number ends with n zeros (meaning it is divisible by 10ⁿ), then its square will be divisible by 10^(2n), resulting in 2n zeros at the end. The squaring process doubles the number of factors of 10 (i.e., both factors contribute a set of zeros), which is why the resulting square always has an even number of zeros at the end.",
    "explanation": "For example, if a number is written as k×10³, then its square is k²×10⁶, meaning the squared number ends with 6 zeros. This doubling of the exponent on 10 confirms that square numbers always have an even number of trailing zeros when the original number ends with zeros.",
