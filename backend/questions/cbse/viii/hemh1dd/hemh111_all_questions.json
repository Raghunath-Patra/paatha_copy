    "correct_answer": "If x and y are directly proportional, then by definition x = ky, where k is constant. For any two pairs (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), we have x₁ = k y₁ and x₂ = k y₂, so x₁/y₁ = k and x₂/y₂ = k, proving x₁/y₁ = x₂/y₂. For example, with a car travelling at a constant speed, if it covers 60 km in 4 liters of petrol then the ratio (60/4 = 15 km per liter) remains constant. So, if 8 liters are used, the distance travelled is 8 × 15 = 120 km.",
    "explanation": "The key idea is the constant ratio k. Since both pairs (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) equal k when divided appropriately, the ratio remains unchanged. This invariance underlines direct proportionality. The uniform motion example reinforces the concept by showing that the distance per unit of petrol remains constant.",

    "correct_answer": "Compound interest is calculated using the formula CI = P[(1 + r/100)ⁿ - 1], where n is the number of periods. This formula is exponential in nature (due to the power n) and not linear. Thus, while simple interest is given by SI = (P × r × n)/100, which shows direct proportion with time, the computed compound interest increases exponentially as n increases. Therefore, compound interest does not vary directly with time.",
    "explanation": "In simple interest, the interest earned every period is constant, hence SI ∝ n. However, in compound interest, the interest is added to the principal for the calculation of interest in the subsequent periods, leading to an exponential growth represented by the factor (1 + r/100)ⁿ.
