    "correct_answer": "Two cuboids with the same volume may have different surface areas because while the product of length, breadth, and height remains constant, the individual dimensions vary. This alters the total area of all faces. A more 'cube-like' shape tends to minimize surface area for a given volume.",
    "explanation": "Surface area depends on the sums of the areas of each pair of faces. Even if the volume (l × b × h) is fixed, different combinations of l, b, and h yield different pairs of face areas. A shape approaching a cube minimizes the exposed surface relative to its volume.",

    "explanation": "Step 1: Calculate the surface area of Box A and Box B using the formula SA = 2(lb + bh + hl). Box A: SA = 2[(3×8) + (8×20) + (20×3)] = 2[24 + 160 + 60] = 488 cm². Box B: SA = 2[(4×12) + (12×10) + (10×4)] = 2[48 + 120 + 40] = 416 cm². Step 2: Compare these surface areas and notice that Box B has a lower surface area.
