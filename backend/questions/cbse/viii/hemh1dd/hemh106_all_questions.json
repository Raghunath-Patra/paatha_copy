    "explanation": "First, factorize 392: 392 = 2³ × 7². For it to be a perfect cube, the exponent of each prime factor must be a multiple of 3. While 2³ is already acceptable, 7² needs one additional 7 to become 7³. Thus, multiplying 392 by 7 yields 392 × 7 = 2744, which is 14³, a perfect cube.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "4 cuboids",
    "explanation": "The volume of the cuboid is 15 × 30 × 15 = 6750 cm³. Upon prime factorization, 6750 = 2 × 3³ × 5³. To form a perfect cube the volume must have each prime factor to an exponent that is a multiple of 3. Since the factor 2 is only to the first power, we need to provide two additional 2’s (i.e., multiply by 2² = 4) so that the new product becomes (2³) × (3³) × (5³). Hence, 4 cuboids are needed to form a cube.",
