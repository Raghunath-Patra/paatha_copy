    "explanation": "To convert a number into standard form, one rewrites it as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10. For (i), 0.0000000000085 is rewritten as 8.5 by moving the decimal 12 places to the right, yielding 8.5 × 10⁻¹². Similarly, (ii) becomes 9.42 × 10⁻¹². For (iii), shifting the decimal so that 6020000000000000 becomes 6.02 requires moving it 15 places to the left, hence 6.02 × 10¹⁵. In (iv), 0.00000000837 converts to 8.37 × 10⁻⁹ (moving the decimal 9 places to the right), and (v) is rewritten as 3.186 × 10¹⁰ by moving the decimal 10 places to the left.",

    "explanation": "Expressing numbers in usual (decimal) form means carrying out the multiplication indicated by the power of 10. For (i), 3.02 × 10⁻⁶ means shifting the decimal point 6 places to the left resulting in 0.00000302. For (ii), 4.5 × 10⁴ shifts the decimal 4 places to obtain 45000. Similarly, (iii) becomes 0.00000003, (iv) becomes 1.0001 followed by 9 digits to yield 1000100000, (v) becomes 5800000000000 by moving 12 places, and (vi) becomes 3614920 by shifting 6 places.",

(ii) The charge of an electron, 0.00000000000000000016, is rewritten as 1.6 by moving the decimal 19 places to the right, yielding 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C. (iii) 0.0000005 m becomes 5 × 10⁻⁷ m.
