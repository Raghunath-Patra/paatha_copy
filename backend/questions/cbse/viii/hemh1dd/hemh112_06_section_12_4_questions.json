    "correct_answer": "Advantages include a streamlined simplification process by reducing expressions quickly after factoring, which minimizes computational effort. However, pitfalls include the risk of canceling terms out of context when they are not common to every term, and potential division by zero if variables lead to zero denominators. For example, in dividing 7x²+14x by (x+2), cancellation works perfectly because (x+2) is a clear factor; however, if an expression is only partially factorable, term-by-term cancellation could lead to errors.",
