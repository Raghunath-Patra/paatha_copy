For the expression 3x(x + 2), the term '3x' is already a product of 3 and x, both of which are irreducible. The term (x + 2) is a binomial that cannot be factored further (over the integers). Thus, 3x(x + 2) can be expressed as 3 × x × (x + 2), which is its irreducible factor form.",

    "correct_answer": "The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every natural number greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes, and this factorization is unique up to the order of the factors. For example, the number 30 can be factored into primes as 2 × 3 × 5. Suppose there exists another distinct factorization into primes; through the application of the uniqueness property of prime numbers, one would reach a contradiction because primes have no other divisors apart from 1 and themselves. Thus, the prime factors 2, 3, and 5 are uniquely determined for 30. This reasoning holds in general because any two distinct prime factorizations would imply a prime number divides a product in two incompatible ways, violating the definition of a prime.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Express the number in one prime factorization; for 30, this is 2 × 3 × 5.\nStep 2: Assume there is an alternative factorization into primes, say p × q × r, that is different from 2, 3, 5.\nStep 3: By the properties of prime numbers, each prime in the original factorization must divide the product on the right and, by the lemma of Euclid, must be equal to one of the primes in the alternative factorization.\nStep 4: This process shows that the primes in both factorizations must be the same when disregarding order, thereby proving uniqueness.\nStep 5: Generalize this method to any natural number, confirming the fundamental theorem.",
