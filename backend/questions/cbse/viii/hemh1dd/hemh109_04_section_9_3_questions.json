In a cube, all 6 faces are identical squares.\nStep 2: Note that both shapes have 12 edges and 8 vertices.\nStep 3: Emphasize that while every cube is a cuboid, not every cuboid is a cube since a cube has the added restriction of having all faces equal.\nThis analysis relies on understanding the properties of rectangular prisms and the special case of the cube.",
