For (i) 1057 (ends in 7), (ii) 23453 (ends in 3), (iii) 7928 (ends in 8), (iv) 222222 (ends in 2) – since perfect squares can only end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. Also, (v) 64000, (vii) 222000, and any number ending with zeros must have an even number of trailing zeros; 64000 and 222000 have an odd number which disqualifies them. Additionally, (vi) 89722 (ends in 2) and (viii) 505050 (pattern of digits/tail zeros inconsistent with a perfect square) are not perfect squares.",
    "explanation": "A necessary condition for a natural number to be a perfect square is that its unit digit must be one of 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. Moreover, if a perfect square ends with one or more zeros, they appear in pairs (an even number). Checking each provided number: 1057 (ends with 7), 23453 (ends with 3), 7928 (ends with 8), 222222 (ends with 2), and 89722 (ends with 2) immediately do not qualify. For numbers ending with 0 like 64000 and 222000, a perfect square must have an even count of zeros; since these do not, they cannot be perfect squares. Similarly, 505050 fails the digit pattern requirement.",
