    "explanation": "The method requires placing bars above digits in pairs. For the integral part, the grouping starts from the unit’s digit moving left; for the decimal part, the grouping starts immediately after the decimal moving right. The process continues by guessing a digit for the quotient, multiplying the formed divisor by this digit, subtracting from the current dividend, and bringing down the next pair until the remainder becomes zero (or until the desired precision is reached).",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "Since the area of a square is given by side², if Area = 2304 m², then side = √2304. Using the bar method:\n1. Group the number as 23 04. For the first group 23, the largest square less than or equal to 23 is 4² = 16; place 4 in the quotient.\n2. Subtract 16 from 23 to get a remainder of 7 and bring down 04, forming 704.\n3. Double 4 (the current quotient) to get 8, which is used to form the new divisor '8_'. Find the digit that, when appended, makes (8_ × digit) ≤704. Here, 88×8 = 704.\n4. Place 8 to get a quotient of 48, and since the remainder becomes 0, √2304 = 48.\nProof: Since 48² = 2304, the claim is validated.",
    "explanation": "The process begins by equating the area of a square to the square of its side. Through the bar method, we systematically determine each digit of the square root. After grouping and subtracting the appropriate squares, the procedure confirms that 48 is the side length, as 48² equals 2304.

For the first group '2', the largest square is 1² = 1 (since 2 is less than 4), so we consider the combined group if needed; more commonly, we treat '289' as a whole grouped into '2' and '89' because the standard process yields the known perfect square.\n2. Alternatively, note that 17×17=289. Using the bar method:\n   - Group: 2 | 89. The square root of 2 is too small, so combine the groups to treat 289 as one number.\n   - Recognize that 16² = 256 and 17² = 289, hence the quotient digit is 17.\nThus, √289.00 = 17.",
