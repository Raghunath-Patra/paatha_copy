    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Estimation techniques simplify calculations by rounding numbers to facilitate mental computation. For a bill of ₹589, one can round off to ₹590 (nearest tens). Then, calculating 10% of ₹590 gives ₹59, and doubling this value provides 20%: 2 × 59 = ₹118. Therefore, the estimated discount is ₹118, and the approximate sale price is 590 - 118 = ₹472. \n\nThe rounding process reduces computational complexity and allows for quick approximations, which are close enough to the exact values for practical purposes.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Round ₹589 to ₹590 for simplicity. \nStep 2: Calculate 10% of ₹590: 10% = 59. \nStep 3: Double the 10% value to estimate 20%: 2 × 59 = ₹118. \nStep 4: Subtract the estimated discount from the rounded bill: 590 - 118 = ₹472. \nThis method highlights how rounding facilitates quick mental calculations while maintaining reasonable accuracy.",
