    "explanation": "Step 1: A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides. A square clearly has four sides.\nStep 2: A parallelogram is defined by having two pairs of parallel sides. A square meets this criterion as its opposite sides are parallel.\nStep 3: A rhombus is a parallelogram with all four sides equal in length. In a square, all sides are equal, making it a rhombus as well.\nStep 4: A rectangle is defined as a parallelogram with four right angles. Since every angle in a square is 90°, it qualifies as a rectangle.\nThus, a square possesses all these properties simultaneously.",

    "explanation": "A convex quadrilateral is defined as one in which every interior angle is less than 180°. In a rectangle, each of the four angles is 90°, so no indentations exist. Therefore, any segment joining two points within the rectangle cannot exit the shape, confirming its convexity.",

    "explanation": "Step 1: In any triangle, the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect is called the circumcenter, and it is equidistant from all vertices.\nStep 2: In a right-angled triangle, the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the circumcenter.\nStep 3: Thus, by the definition of the circumcenter, O (being the midpoint of the hypotenuse) is equidistant from vertices A, B, and C.\nThis special property can also be visualized by drawing the circle circumscribed about the triangle.",

    "correct_answer": "Yes, a square can also be defined as a rhombus with equal angles. In any rhombus the sides are equal, and if all angles are equal then each must be 90° because the total interior angles sum to 360°. Hence, the rhombus becomes a square.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: A rhombus is defined by having all four sides of equal length.\nStep 2: However, a general rhombus does not have equal angles; the angles can be acute or obtuse.\nStep 3: If a rhombus is further constrained by having all angles equal, then each angle must be 90° (since 360° divided by 4 equals 90°).\nStep 4: With all sides equal and all angles 90°, the shape satisfies the definition of a square.\nThis alternative definition emphasizes that a square is both a special type of rhombus and a rectangle.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A trapezium, by definition, has at least one pair of parallel sides. It can have all angles equal if it is an isosceles trapezium with the non-parallel sides adjusted so that all interior angles are 90° (which would make it a rectangle). However, having all sides equal in a trapezium would force both pairs of opposite sides to be parallel, thereby making it a parallelogram (specifically, a rhombus if all sides are equal).",
    "explanation": "Step 1: For a trapezium to have all angles equal, each angle must be 90° because 4×90° = 360°. This condition essentially turns the trapezium into a rectangle (if it meets the definition of having only one pair of parallel sides) or even a square if all sides are equal.\nStep 2: A trapezium with all sides equal would no longer fit the general definition of a trapezium, since having all sides equal typically implies that both pairs of opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram (specifically, a rhombus if the angles are not 90°, or a square if they are).\nStep 3: Therefore, while a trapezium might have equal angles in a special case (and be a rectangle), having all sides equal would transform its classification to that of a parallelogram, not a typical trapezium.",
