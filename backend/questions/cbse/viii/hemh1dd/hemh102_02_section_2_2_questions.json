    "correct_answer": "Transposing variable terms involves moving all terms containing the variable to one side of the equation by changing their signs, as seen in the equation 2x – 3 = x + 2. Clearing fractions, on the other hand, involves multiplying the entire equation by the least common denominator to eliminate fractional coefficients, as in 5x + 7/2 = 3/2 x – 14. Both techniques simplify the process of isolating the variable, although they address different components of the equation.",
    "explanation": "Transposition is used to consolidate like terms and isolate the variable, while clearing fractions addresses the complexity introduced by non-integer coefficients. For example, subtracting x in 2x – 3 = x + 2 simplifies the equation directly to x – 3 = 2, whereas multiplying by 2 in the fractional equation removes denominators and converts the equation into one with easier-to-manage integer coefficients.",
