    "correct_answer": "Box (a)",
    "explanation": "For a cuboid, the total surface area (TSA) is given by 2(lb + bh + hl).\nFor box (a): l = 60 cm, b = 40 cm, h = 50 cm, so TSA = 2[(60×40) + (40×50) + (60×50)] = 2[2400 + 2000 + 3000] = 2[7400] = 14800 cm².\nFor a cube, TSA = 6 × (side)². For box (b): side = 50 cm, so TSA = 6 × 2500 = 15000 cm².\nSince 14800 cm² < 15000 cm², box (a) requires the lesser amount of material.",

    "explanation": "Step 1: Calculate the surface area of one suitcase. For a cuboid, surface area = 2[(l×b) + (b×h) + (l×h)]. Here, l = 80 cm, b = 48 cm, and h = 24 cm.\n→ SA = 2[(80×48) + (48×24) + (80×24)] = 2[(3840) + (1152) + (1920)] = 2[6912] = 13824 cm².\nStep 2: For 100 suitcases, total area = 100 × 13824 = 1,382,400 cm².\nStep 3: The tarpaulin cloth comes in a width of 96 cm. When unfolded as a rectangular sheet, its area is (length in cm) × 96 cm. Let L be the required length in cm.\nWe have: L × 96 = 1,382,400 cm²  ⇒  L = 1,382,400 / 96 = 14,400 cm.\nStep 4: Convert 14,400 cm to metres: 14,400 cm ÷ 100 = 144 m.",

Thus, lateral area = 2 × π × 3.5 × 7 = 49π ≈ 153.94 cm² (using π ≈ 3.14).\nSince 196 cm² > 153.94 cm², the cube has a larger lateral surface area.",
