(ii) The time taken for a journey and the distance travelled at a uniform speed. (iii) The area of cultivated land and the crop harvested. (iv) The time taken for a fixed journey and the speed of the vehicle. (v) The population of a country and the area of land per person.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(i) Inverse; (ii) Direct; (iii) Direct; (iv) Inverse; (v) Inverse",
    "explanation": "To decide whether two quantities vary inversely, we check if their product remains constant. For (i), as the number of workers increases, the time taken (for a fixed job) decreases; hence they are inversely proportional. For (ii), if speed is constant then time is directly related to distance traveled. In (iii), more area generally leads to more crop harvested (direct relation) and for (iv), a higher speed for a fixed journey implies less time, an inverse relation. In (v), if the population increases, the land available per person decreases, showing an inverse relationship.",
