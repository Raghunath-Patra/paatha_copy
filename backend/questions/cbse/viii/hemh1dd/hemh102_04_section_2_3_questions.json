Since L is a multiple of both B and D, we can write L as k*B and m*D respectively, so the equation becomes k*A = m*C. The equality holds due to the properties of multiplication. Because L is nonzero, dividing does not alter the equality of the equation, meaning any solution to the original equation must satisfy the new equation and vice versa. Thus, the solution set remains the same.",
    "explanation": "The proof hinges on the multiplicative property of equality: if two expressions are equal, multiplying both by the same nonzero number does not disturb the equality. Using the LCM ensures all fractional parts are eliminated, but since the LCM is nonzero, the equivalence is maintained.
