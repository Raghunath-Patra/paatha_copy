    "correct_answer": "Sales Tax is a tax imposed by the government on the sale of an item, calculated as a percentage of the selling price, and then added to the cost of the product. For example, if an item costs ₹450 and the Sales Tax rate is 5%, the Sales Tax is (5/100) × 450 = ₹22.50, making the total bill ₹472.50.",
    "explanation": "In Sales Tax, the tax is determined by multiplying the selling price by the tax rate (expressed as a fraction/percentage). The resulting tax amount is added to the original price to yield the final cost paid by the customer. This method ensures that customers contribute to the tax burden based on how much they spend.",

    "correct_answer": "VAT is added to the base price of a product to form the final selling price, but it is shown as included in the price. For instance, if a product's base price is ₹3000 and there is a 10% VAT, the final price will be ₹3000 + (10% of ₹3000) = ₹3300. In the price listing, only ₹3300 is mentioned, with VAT already factored in.",
    "explanation": "VAT is a tax expressed as a percentage of the base price. The seller first calculates the additional tax amount and then adds it to arrive at the final price. Customers see only the total price, making it appear as if tax is integrated into the cost.",
