The outer boundary is 24×28 cm and the picture opening is 16×20 cm. Since the frame has two uniform sections, the relationship for the intermediate boundary is: 16 + 2w = 24 and 20 + 2w = 28, giving w = 4 cm in the first case and w = 4 cm in the second. However, a more consistent interpretation is to view the frame as having two parts – an outer section between the outer edge and an intermediate rectangle, and an inner section between the intermediate rectangle and the picture opening. Solving via equal widths from outer to inner: The intermediate dimensions become (16 + 2w) by (20 + 2w) with w determined from 24 - (16 + 2w) = (20 + 2w) - 20; solving gives w = 2 cm. Then, the intermediate rectangle is (16 + 2×2) by (20 + 2×2) = 20 by 24 cm. \nOuter section area = Outer area − Intermediate area = (24×28) − (20×24) = 672 − 480 = 192 cm².\nInner section area = Intermediate area − Inner area = (20×24) − (16×20) = 480 − 320 = 160 cm².",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Let the uniform width of each frame section be w.\nStep 2: The picture (inner rectangle) is 16×20 cm. With one frame section added uniformly, the intermediate rectangle becomes (16 + 2w) by (20 + 2w) (since the width is added on both sides).\nStep 3: The outer dimensions are given as 24×28 cm. Setting up the equations:\n  16 + 2w = 24 ⇒ w = 4 cm  (if only one section were added),\nbut since the frame is divided into two sections of equal width, the intermediate boundary is determined by adding one section’s width (w) to the picture dimensions, and the outer frame adds the second section. Hence, we use:\n  Outer length = (16 + 2w) + w = 16 + 3w and Outer width = (20 + 2w) + w = 20 + 3w.\nStep 4: Solve using outer dimensions: 16 + 3w = 24 ⇒ 3w = 8 ⇒ w = 8/3 ≈ 2.67 cm, and 20 + 3w = 28 ⇒ 3w = 8 ⇒ w ≈ 2.67 cm. \nHowever, an alternative standard interpretation (often used in picture frame problems) is that the two sections are the outer border and the inner border, determined by subtracting the inner rectangle from the outer rectangle with the same uniform width along all sides. In that case, the width of the entire frame is (24 – 16)/2 = 4 cm vertically and (28 – 20)/2 = 4 cm horizontally, and the frame is then divided into two sections of equal width, so each section has width 2 cm. \nStep 5: With w = 2 cm for each section:\n • The intermediate rectangle (after the outer section) has dimensions: 16 + 2×2 = 20 cm and 20 + 2×2 = 24 cm.\n • Outer section area = Area of outer rectangle − Area of intermediate rectangle = (24×28) − (20×24) = 672 − 480 = 192 cm².\n • Inner section area = Area of intermediate rectangle − Area of inner rectangle = (20×24) − (16×20) = 480 − 320 = 160 cm².\nThus, the areas of the sections are 192 cm² (outer section) and 160 cm² (inner section).",
