    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When solving the equation 2x = 3, dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 3/2, which is not an integer because it is not a whole number (a fraction lying strictly between 1 and 2). However, since 3/2 can be represented as a quotient of two integers where the divisor is nonzero, it qualifies as a rational number.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Given equation is 2x = 3.\\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 3/2.\\nStep 3: Check the nature of 3/2: It is not an integer because integers do not include fractions or decimals.\\nStep 4: Since 3/2 is expressed as a ratio 3/2, and both 3 and 2 are integers (with 2 ≠ 0), it qualifies as a rational number by definition.\\nStep 5: Conclude that the equation has no solution in the set of integers but does have a valid solution in the set of rational numbers.",
