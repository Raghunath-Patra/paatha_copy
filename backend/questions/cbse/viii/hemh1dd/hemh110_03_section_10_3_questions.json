    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Proof: Let a be a non-zero integer, and let m and n be any integers. We consider three cases: both m and n positive, one positive and one negative, and both negative. Case 1: When m, n > 0, a^m × a^n = a^(m+n) by definition from earlier classes. Case 2: Assume m > 0 and n < 0. Write n as –k (k > 0), then a^m × a^(-k)= a^m × (1/a^k)= a^(m-k) because division of like bases subtracts the exponents. This is consistent with a^(m+(-k)). Case 3: When m and n are both negative, let m = -p and n = -q with p, q > 0. Then a^(-p) × a^(-q)= (1/a^p) × (1/a^q)= 1/a^(p+q)= a^(-(p+q)) which equals a^(m+n). Thus, in all cases, a^m × a^n = a^(m+n).",
