    "correct_answer": "The forces acting on a car on a banked road include the weight (mg) acting vertically downward, the normal reaction (N) acting perpendicular to the banked surface, and the frictional force (f) which can act up or down the slope. Resolving N into vertical and horizontal components gives N cos θ balancing mg (and any vertical component of friction if needed), and N sin θ (plus a component of friction f cos θ) providing the centripetal force m*v²/R. By setting f = µₛN in the worst-case scenario and combining the vertical and horizontal force balance equations, we obtain v_max = √[R g (µₛ + tan θ)/(1 - µₛ tan θ)].",
    "explanation": "For a banked curve, the vertical force balance is N cos θ = mg + f sin θ. The horizontal balance is N sin θ + f cos θ = m*v²/R. Assuming f reaches its maximum value µₛN to avoid slipping, substitute f = µₛN in the equations. Solving the vertical equation for N and substituting into the horizontal force balance equation results in the derived expression for the maximum permissible speed.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "On a level road, friction is the sole source of centripetal force; it must fully counteract the tendency of the car to move tangentially, and if the speed is too high or the turn too sharp, the available static friction may be insufficient, leading to skidding. In contrast, on a banked road, part of the centripetal force is provided by the horizontal component of the normal force. This reduces the reliance on friction, allowing for higher speeds without slipping, and results in less tire wear if the optimum speed is maintained.",
    "explanation": "Friction on a level road has to balance the entire centripetal need as there is no geometric advantage from the road's surface. With banked roads, the design allows the normal force to contribute towards the centripetal requirement, making the system less dependent on friction. This not only provides a wider speed range for safe turning but also minimizes the stress on frictional surfaces such as tires.",

    "correct_answer": "Banked racetracks allow a significant portion of the required centripetal force to be provided by the normal force's horizontal component, reducing the burden on friction. This leads to lower frictional forces at the optimum speed given by v₀ = √(R g tan θ), minimizing tire wear. The greater speed range provided by banked curves enhances safety and performance in high-speed races.",
    "explanation": "In races, maintaining a high speed safely during turns is critical. On a banked track, the forces are distributed such that the normal force contributes to the necessary horizontal force. Deriving the optimum speed: set f = 0 and use vertical equilibrium N cos θ = mg to get N = mg / cos θ, and then the horizontal centripetal force is N sin θ = (mg tan θ). Equating this to m*v₀²/R leads to v₀ = √(R g tan θ). This design not only enables higher speeds but also reduces reliance on tire friction, thereby reducing wear and tear.",
