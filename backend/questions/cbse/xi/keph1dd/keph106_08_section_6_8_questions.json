    "correct_answer": "A rigid body is in mechanical equilibrium if both the net force and the net torque (moment of forces) acting on it are zero. Vectorially, this is expressed as: sum of F's = 0 and sum of torques = 0. Each of these vector equations can be broken down into three independent scalar equations (for the x, y, and z directions), giving a total of six scalar conditions. When the net force is zero, any change of the point of reference (origin) only adds a term that vanishes, thereby making the net torque independent of the origin.",
    "explanation": "The equilibrium conditions are derived from Newton's laws. The translational equilibrium condition (sum F = 0) ensures that there is no linear acceleration, while the rotational equilibrium condition (sum torque = 0) ensures no angular acceleration. For a force F applied at a position r, the torque is r x F. If we shift the origin by r0, the new torque is (r + r0) x F = r x F + r0 x F. However, if sum F = 0, the summation over r0 x F vanishes, showing that the total torque remains unchanged by the shift in origin.",

    "explanation": "In a lever system, forces act at different distances from the fulcrum. The condition for equilibrium is that the clockwise moments must balance the anticlockwise moments.

For example, when balancing a homogeneous board on a pencil, the board remains horizontal only when the pencil’s tip is directly beneath its center of mass, which is also its center of gravity.",
    "explanation": "When an object is subjected to gravity, each part experiences a gravitational force. The CG is the unique point where these forces produce no net torque.
