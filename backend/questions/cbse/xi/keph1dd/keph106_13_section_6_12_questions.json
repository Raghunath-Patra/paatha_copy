    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The principle dL/dt = τ indicates that the rate of change of angular momentum equals the net external torque acting on the system. In the case of rotation about a fixed axis, if no external torque is applied (τ = 0), the angular momentum is conserved. In experimental setups like the swivel chair demonstration, when a person extends their arms, the moment of inertia increases, requiring a decrease in angular speed to conserve angular momentum. Conversely, when the arms are drawn in, the moment of inertia decreases, and the angular speed increases. This reflects in the equation τ = I × α where, with I constant or changes only due to internal redistribution of mass, any external influences are negligible, and conservation holds.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that by applying dL/dt = τ to a rotating rigid body, we understand that any changes in angular speed (and thus kinetic energy) come from the net external torque. In a closed system with negligible external torque, the angular momentum must remain constant, leading to observable phenomena such as the slowing of a swivel chair when arms are extended and speeding up when they are retracted.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For symmetric bodies, due to the mirror-image distribution of mass, the contributions to the angular momentum that are perpendicular to the rotation axis cancel out, so the total angular momentum vector L points along the axis (i.e., L = Lz). In contrast, non-symmetric bodies do not have such pairing of mass elements, and thus the perpendicular component L⊥ does not necessarily cancel out. As a result, the total angular momentum vector in non-symmetric bodies may not be aligned with the fixed rotation axis.",
    "explanation": "The explanation should stress that symmetry ensures cancellation of lateral contributions in L, leaving only the component along the axis. For non-symmetric bodies, however, the asymmetry in mass distribution leads to residual components perpendicular to the axis, meaning L is not fully characterized by Lz. This difference is crucial for predicting the behavior of various rotating systems.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the swivel chair experiment, a person initially spins with arms folded (small moment of inertia) resulting in a higher angular speed. When the arms are extended, the moment of inertia increases, forcing a decrease in angular speed to conserve angular momentum, as angular momentum L, given by the product I × ω, must remain constant in the absence of external torque. The underlying physical assumption is that no significant external torques (such as friction) act on the system, making it a closed system where conservation principles apply. Additionally, it is assumed that the moment of inertia changes only due to a re-distribution of mass relative to the rotation axis.",
    "explanation": "This detailed analysis shows that by altering body configuration, the moment of inertia changes while the product I × ω remains constant, demonstrating conservation of angular momentum.
