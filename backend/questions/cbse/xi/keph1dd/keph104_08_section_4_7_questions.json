    "correct_answer": "In the recoil of a firearm, the system (gun and bullet) is assumed to be isolated with negligible external forces. When the bullet is fired, it gains momentum in one direction. By Newton's third law, the gun experiences an equal and opposite momentum. This results in the recoil. The analysis assumes that there are no external forces (like friction or air resistance) acting on the system and that the initial momentum of the system was zero.",
    "explanation": "The recoil is explained by applying the conservation of momentum, p_bullet + p_gun = 0. Since the system is isolated, the only forces at work are internal. By assuming an initial state of rest and neglecting external influences, we simplify the real-life scenario to focus solely on the momentum transfer mechanism explained by Newton's laws.",

    "correct_answer": "In both elastic and inelastic collisions, momentum is conserved because the forces between the bodies are internal and obey Newton's laws. However, in elastic collisions, kinetic energy is also conserved while in inelastic collisions some of the kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy (heat, sound, etc.). A practical example is two billiard balls colliding elastically, where they bounce off nearly unchanged, versus car accidents, which are inelastic as the vehicles often stick together and kinetic energy is lost in deformation and heat.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in energy transformation. In elastic collisions, no energy is lost to the environment, making both momentum and kinetic energy constant. In inelastic collisions, although momentum remains constant, kinetic energy is not, as energy is partly converted to non-mechanical forms. This analysis is crucial for understanding real-world collision behaviors.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's second law relates the force acting on an object to its change in momentum over time, while Newton's third law states that forces between two interacting bodies are equal and opposite. During a collision, if F_AB is the force exerted by body A on body B over a time delta t, then F_AB multiplied by delta t represents the change in momentum of body B. Similarly, F_BA = - F_AB causes an opposite change in the momentum of body A. Therefore, p_A' - p_A = - (p_B' - p_B), which simplifies to p_A' + p_B' = p_A + p_B, showing that the total momentum before and after the collision remains the same.",
    "explanation": "By applying Newton's second law to each body during the collision and recognizing the action-reaction forces using Newton’s third law, we demonstrate that the impulses on each body are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
