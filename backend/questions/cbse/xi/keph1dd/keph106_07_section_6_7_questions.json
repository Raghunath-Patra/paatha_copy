Since dr/dt is the velocity v and p = mv, the term v × p equals zero because v and p are parallel. Therefore, dL/dt = r × dp/dt. Recognizing that dp/dt is the force F, we get dL/dt = r × F, which is the definition of torque τ.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the bicycle rim experiment, the rim is rotated about its axle, which imparts it with significant angular momentum. When a string is released, the external torque acting about the point of suspension causes the rim’s angular momentum vector to change direction, leading to precession. Precession occurs because the torque, which is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector, continuously changes its direction without altering its magnitude. The conservation of angular momentum ensures that, despite the precessional motion, the total angular momentum remains constant if no external torques act in the direction of the angular momentum's components.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that the conservation of angular momentum and the effect of an external torque produce a precessional motion. The direction change without a change in magnitude is characteristic of gyroscopic precession.",
