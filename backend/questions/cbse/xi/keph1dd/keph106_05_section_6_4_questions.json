    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the radioactive decay of a radium nucleus, the total momentum before decay is equal to the momentum of the radium nucleus. When the nucleus decays into a radon nucleus and an alpha particle, the internal forces cause the products to fly apart in different directions. However, because the external forces are negligible, the vector sum of the momenta of the radon nucleus and the alpha particle must equal the original momentum of the radium nucleus. This is an illustration of the conservation of momentum equation dP/dt = F_ext, where F_ext equals zero.",
    "explanation": "Since the external forces are negligible, the total momentum of the system remains conserved. The radium nucleus had an initial momentum P. After decay, the momentum components of the radon nucleus and the alpha particle add up to P. Even if the individual momenta are large and in varying directions, their vector sum must match the original momentum, thus conserving momentum. This principle is fundamental to understanding decay processes in nuclear physics.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Separating the motion into the uniform motion of the center-of-mass and the orbital motion of the stars simplifies the analysis because the center of mass moves as a free particle when the external force is zero. Once the center-of-mass motion is determined, the complex orbital motions of the individual stars around the center of mass, often appearing as intricate paths, can be treated separately as circular or elliptical orbits. This approach makes it easier to account for gravitational interactions and analyze the system’s dynamics.",
    "explanation": "In a binary star system with no external forces, the center-of-mass moves with a constant velocity. By shifting into the center-of-mass frame, the analysis of the mutual gravitational orbit simplifies, as the stars then follow predictable orbital paths (e.g., circles or ellipses) around a stationary center. In the laboratory frame, the motion is a superposition of the uniform translation of the center of mass and the relative orbital motion. This decomposition clarifies the contribution of different forces and simplifies calculations.",
