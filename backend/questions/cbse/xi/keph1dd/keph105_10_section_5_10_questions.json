    "explanation": "The formula P = F · v is derived from the definition of power as the rate of doing work.

Energy is the capacity to do work, existing in various forms (kinetic, potential, etc.). Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred, given by P = W/t or P = F · v. These concepts are interrelated; work and energy have the same units, and power quantifies how quickly work is performed.",
    "explanation": "Work, energy, and power are key aspects of mechanics. Work involves applying a force to move an object, energy is a broader measure of the ability to perform work, and power indicates the speed of energy transfer or work done.

    "correct_answer": "An increase in speed results in an increased power requirement because power is directly proportional to velocity (P = F · v). Even if frictional force and gravitational force remain constant, a higher speed means more work is done per unit time, demanding a higher power output from the motor.",
    "explanation": "Given the formula P = F · v, if the force remains constant (sum of gravitational and frictional forces), an increase in velocity directly increases the instantaneous power.
