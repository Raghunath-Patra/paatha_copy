Since the gravitational potential energy V is given by -G M_E m/(R_E + h), differentiating V with respect to h gives the force. Using the relationship g(h) = F(h)/m and substituting g = G M_E/R_E^2, we obtain g(h) = g / (1 + h/R_E)^2. For h much smaller than R_E, a binomial expansion yields g(h) ≈ g (1 - 2h/R_E).",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The result signifies that the gravitational force is strongest at the surface because the entire mass of the Earth contributes fully. When moving upward, the increased distance reduces the force as it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. When moving downward, only the mass within the radius (R_E - d) contributes due to the Shell Theorem, effectively reducing the local gravitational force. These two effects ensure that g reaches a maximum at the surface and decreases both above and below it.",
    "explanation": "At the Earth's surface, the distance from the centre is minimal, leading to the maximum gravitational acceleration. Above the surface, g decreases as 1/(R_E + h)^2; for small h this decrease is approximately linear (g ≈ g (1 - 2h/R_E)). Below the surface, the contribution to gravity comes only from the mass inside the sphere of radius (R_E - d); as d increases, the contributing mass decreases (proportional to (R_E - d)^3), leading to a linear decrease of g with depth (g(d) = g (1 - d/R_E)).
