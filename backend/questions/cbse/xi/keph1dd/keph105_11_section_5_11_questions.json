    "correct_answer": "In two-dimensional collisions, momentum is conserved separately in both the x and y directions. This provides two independent equations, one for the x-component and one for the y-component of momentum. However, there are typically four unknowns: the final speeds of the two masses and the two angles of deflection. To solve the problem, additional information is needed, such as specifying one of the angles, which then allows the use of the kinetic energy conservation equation in the case of elastic collisions to obtain further relationships. As an example, in a billiard ball collision, if the angle of deflection of one ball is known (for instance, from a detector), the remaining unknowns (the other ball's speed and angle and the deflection angle of the cue ball) can be calculated by simultaneously solving the momentum equations and the kinetic energy equation.",
    "explanation": "Two-dimensional collisions require balancing momentum independently along perpendicular axes. Since there are more unknowns than available independent conservation laws, additional given information (e.g. a specific deflection angle) is necessary. The interplay between momentum conservation and, in elastic cases, kinetic energy conservation allows the complete determination of the final velocities and directions.",
