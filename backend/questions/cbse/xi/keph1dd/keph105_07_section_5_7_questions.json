Using conservation of energy, we equate the potential energy to the kinetic energy at the bottom: 1/2 mv² = mgh. Solving for v gives v = sqrt(2gh). This derivation shows that the loss in potential energy equals the gain in kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "This problem involves energy conversion. Initially, the ball has potential energy mgh and zero kinetic energy. As it falls, the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases. By energy conservation, the total energy remains constant so that mgh (initial potential energy) equals 1/2 mv² (kinetic energy at the ground).

    "correct_answer": "For a conservative force acting in one dimension, the work done when moving an object from x1 to x2 is given by W = ∫[x1 to x2] F(x) dx. By definition, this work is equal to -(V(x2) - V(x1)). Equating the integrals, we have ∫[x1 to x2] F(x) dx = -∫[V(x1) to V(x2)] dV. Differentiating both sides with respect to x gives F(x) = -dV/dx. This indicates that the force is always directed towards regions of lower potential energy.",
    "explanation": "In conservative systems, the potential energy function V(x) is defined such that its derivative gives the force by F(x) = -dV/dx. This derivation shows that the energy lost by an object as it moves in the force field is stored as an increase in kinetic energy. The negative sign confirms that the force is directed opposite to the increase of potential energy, which is consistent with the tendency of systems to move toward lower energy states.",
