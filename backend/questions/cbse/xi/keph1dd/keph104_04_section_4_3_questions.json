    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Galileo’s experiments with the double inclined plane showed that when a ball is released from a height, it converts potential energy to kinetic energy as it descends. As it ascends the other plane, this kinetic energy is transformed back into potential energy, allowing the ball to nearly reach its original height. In the ideal, frictionless condition, the ball would exactly reach the starting height, demonstrating that in the absence of external forces (like friction), the state of motion remains unaltered. This directly contributed to the formulation of the law of inertia.",
    "explanation": "The experiment illustrates energy conservation where mechanical energy is exchanged between potential and kinetic forms without loss. Galileo observed that any deviation from the ideal outcome was due to friction, bolstering his conclusion that the natural state of a body is to continue in uniform motion. This reasoning laid the groundwork for Newton's first law of motion.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The double inclined plane experiment is significant as it visually and practically demonstrates the conservation of energy, with potential energy converting to kinetic energy and vice versa. The fact that the ball eventually reaches nearly the same height—despite traveling a longer distance on a shallower slope—implies that in an ideal situation without friction, there is no net external force acting on the ball. Any change in the motion (i.e., failure to reach the original height) in real experiments is attributed to external forces such as friction and air resistance.",
    "explanation": "By analyzing the path of the ball, one realizes that while the energy transformations remain constant in an ideal scenario, any actual deviation is due to external forces. This reinforces the concept that a net external force is required only to alter the state of motion, not to maintain it. Thus, the experiment underscores both energy conservation and the inherent inertia of bodies.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ancient Indian thinkers had developed detailed theories of motion that included various types of forces such as continuous pressure, impact, and the inherent tendency of objects to move in a straight line (vega). Their focus on measurement and the concept of instantaneous motion anticipated modern notions like velocity and differential calculus. While Galileo provided experimental evidence for the law of inertia, ancient Indian thought had already considered factors like frictional resistance (contact with atmosphere) that affect motion. Both traditions, though developed in different cultural and historical contexts, converged on the understanding that motion involves transformations and interactions of energy, setting the stage for later formalizations in classical mechanics.",
    "explanation": "The analysis shows that ancient Indian science recognized multiple forces and the inherent resistance to change in motion, akin to the concept of inertia. While Galileo's experiments provided the empirical support for these ideas, ancient theories contributed conceptual groundwork. This juxtaposition highlights a cross-cultural evolution of ideas leading to our current understanding of physical laws.",
