    "explanation": "Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. When a bus accelerates, even though friction acts on the passengers' feet, the rest of the body takes a moment to catch up, resulting in a perceived backward motion relative to the bus.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's First Law is applicable to a spaceship in interstellar space because, in the absence of significant external forces (such as gravitational pulls from nearby stars), the spaceship will maintain its state of rest or uniform motion. The primary assumption is that external forces are negligible, meaning the net force acting on the spaceship is nearly zero, and therefore, by Newton's First Law, its acceleration is zero.",
    "explanation": "In interstellar space, a spaceship is often assumed to be far from massive objects that can exert appreciable gravitational forces. Under these conditions, with all propulsion systems off, no external force alters its velocity. This situation clearly illustrates Newton's First Law where an object remains in its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "While the statement 'W equals R' correctly indicates that the gravitational force (W) is balanced by the normal force (R), it is incomplete without noting that the book's state of rest is an observation that, by Newton's First Law, implies zero net external force. The proper context is that the forces are balanced because the book is observed to be in equilibrium, not merely because W and R have the same magnitude.",
    "explanation": "In physics, stating forces cancel requires empirical observation or known equilibrium conditions. Since the book is at rest, we use Newton's First Law to deduce that the net force must be zero, which in turn tells us that any upward force (such as the normal force) must equal the downward gravitational force. The emphasis is on inferring the force balance from the observed lack of acceleration.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In terrestrial settings, objects are often subject to multiple forces like gravity, friction, and air resistance. Even when not all forces are directly visible, one can infer their presence by observing the object's motion. For instance, an object moving at constant velocity indicates that the net external force is zero, meaning any forces, such as gravitational pull and frictional resistance, are balanced. By analyzing the motion and employing Newton's First Law, one can deduce that non-obvious forces are present even if they cancel each other out.",
    "explanation": "Observation of uniform motion or equilibrium allows physicists to infer the roles of forces that may not be explicitly measured. For example, a car moving steadily on a road is subject to gravitational force and friction. While the net force is zero because the car maintains constant speed, each force is still acting. This method of inferring force balances illustrates how external forces are identified even when some of them are not immediately apparent.",
