    "correct_answer": "For a uniform sphere, cylinder, ring, and cube, the centre of mass is located at their geometric centre. However, the centre of mass does not necessarily lie inside the body if the mass distribution is non‐convex or irregular.",
    "explanation": "Uniform, symmetric shapes have their mass evenly distributed so that the mass‐weighted average of positions (i.e. the centre of mass) coincides with the geometric centre. In contrast, if a body is non‑convex or its mass distribution is irregular, the centre of mass can lie outside the actual material boundaries.",

In a radioactive decay process, even though the individual decay fragments (such as the radon nucleus and the alpha particle) are subject to large internal forces, their vector sum of momenta must equal the original momentum of the radium nucleus. This means that if the radium nucleus was moving before decay, the center-of-mass of the resulting system will continue in the same direction at the same speed.",
    "explanation": "During radioactive decay, all forces involved are internal. Conservation of momentum dictates that the momentum before decay equals the momentum after decay. Therefore, regardless of the directions of the radon nucleus and the alpha particle after splitting, the vector sum of their momenta is equal to the initial momentum of the radium nucleus.

    "explanation": "When external forces are absent or negligible, the center-of-mass motion is uniform and can be treated as a simple free particle motion.

In the center-of-mass frame, however, the center of mass is at rest, and each star follows a simple circular (or elliptical, depending on the scenario) trajectory around this fixed point. This comparison highlights how the center-of-mass frame can simplify the understanding of orbital dynamics.",
    "explanation": "In the lab frame, the overall motion includes both the linear translation of the center of mass and the individual orbital paths of the stars. Switching to the center-of-mass frame removes the translational component, showing that the stars orbit with respect to a fixed point.

    "explanation": "In pure translation (e.g., a sliding block), every point in the body follows the same linear trajectory and has the same speed. In contrast, during combined motion (e.g., a rolling cylinder), while the centre of mass follows a straight-line or curved path, the rotation causes points at different radial distances to have different speeds (v = ωr).

    "correct_answer": "A rolling cylinder down an inclined plane exhibits both translational motion, as its centre of mass moves down the slope, and rotational motion about its axis. The condition for rolling without slipping requires that the velocity of the centre of mass equals the product of the angular velocity and the radius (v = ωr) so that the point of contact with the plane is momentarily at rest.",
    "explanation": "When a cylinder rolls without slipping, every point on the cylinder experiences a combination of linear translation and rotation. The centre of mass moves steadily down the incline, while each point on the cylinder follows a circular path relative to the axis.

This simplifies the analysis by reducing the complexity of dealing with multiple interacting particles to a single point mass, making it easier to apply Newton’s laws of motion and predict the behaviour of the body under various forces.",
    "explanation": "Using the centre of mass concept, complex rotational and translational motions of extended bodies can be decomposed and analyzed separately.

    "correct_answer": "Internal torques cancel because the forces between any two particles are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and act along the line joining the particles. This means that the torque produced by one force is exactly canceled by the torque produced by its reaction force, in accordance with Newton’s third law.",

Since dr/dt is the velocity v and p = mv, the term v × p equals zero because v and p are parallel. Therefore, dL/dt = r × dp/dt. Recognizing that dp/dt is the force F, we get dL/dt = r × F, which is the definition of torque τ.",

    "correct_answer": "In the bicycle rim experiment, the rim is rotated about its axle, which imparts it with significant angular momentum. When a string is released, the external torque acting about the point of suspension causes the rim’s angular momentum vector to change direction, leading to precession. Precession occurs because the torque, which is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector, continuously changes its direction without altering its magnitude. The conservation of angular momentum ensures that, despite the precessional motion, the total angular momentum remains constant if no external torques act in the direction of the angular momentum's components.",

Similarly, for a circular disc, the moment of inertia is lower when rotated about an axis through the center compared to an axis along the edge.",
    "explanation": "The moment of inertia is calculated by integrating mass elements times the square of their perpendicular distances from the rotation axis. Changing the axis alters these distances. This is clearly seen in the given examples: the rod’s I increases as the distances from the new axis become larger, and for a disc, the central axis minimizes these distances compared to an off-center axis.

The procedure involves measuring the acceleration for various configurations, analyzing the data using the relation τ = I α, and verifying that I increases with the square of the distance of the weights from the axis.",
    "explanation": "The experiment should include a flywheel mounted on a low-friction axle. Weights are added at varying distances from the center to modify the moment of inertia. A constant torque is applied using a known force and lever arm. By measuring the angular acceleration in each configuration and using the equation τ = I α, one can compute I.

    "correct_answer": "In rotational motion about a fixed axis, each particle of the rigid body moves in a circular path within a plane that is perpendicular to the axis. The linear velocity (v) of any point is given by the product of the angular velocity (omega) and its distance (r) from the axis (v = r * omega). This means that points located farther from the axis move faster in terms of linear speed, even though the entire body shares the same angular velocity.",
    "explanation": "The kinematics of rotational motion involves describing the circular paths each point takes. Because each point moves with speed proportional to its radial distance (r), the variation in linear speed is inherent. This is crucial when analyzing forces or energy in rotating systems.

    "correct_answer": "Pure translational motion is characterized by every particle in the body having the same velocity at every instant, as seen in the example of a block sliding down an inclined plane. In this case, the orientation of the object does not change. In contrast, a combination of translation and rotation involves the centre of mass moving along a path while the body also rotates about its centre of mass, like a rolling cylinder. In the rolling cylinder, different points on the body have different instantaneous velocities, and the point of contact with the surface is momentarily at rest. This combination leads to more complex dynamics where rotational kinetic energy must also be considered.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the distribution of velocity throughout the body. Pure translation implies uniform motion without rotation, whereas combined motion involves added rotational effects. Understanding both motions requires separating the translational movement of the centre of mass from the rotational motion about it.

For a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia I = (1/2)*m*R² = 0.5*2*(0.2)² = 0.04 kg*m². The total kinetic energy at the bottom is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energies: KE_total = (1/2)*m*v² + (1/2)*I*(v²/(R²)). Substituting I and R, the rotational KE becomes (1/2)*0.04*(v²/0.04) = 0.5*v². Thus, KE_total = v² + 0.5*v² = 1.5*v². Setting the potential energy equal to the total kinetic energy, 49 J = 1.5*v², we get v² = 49/1.5 ≈ 32.67, which gives v ≈ sqrt(32.67) ≈ 5.7 m/s.",

    "correct_answer": "The principle of moments for a lever states that if a lever is in equilibrium, the moment produced by the load (F1 × d1) equals the moment produced by the effort (F2 × d2), leading to the equation: F1 × d1 = F2 × d2. From this, the mechanical advantage (MA) is defined as MA = F1 / F2 = d2 / d1. Real-life examples include seesaws, crowbars, and balance scales.",
    "explanation": "In a lever system, forces act at different distances from the fulcrum. The condition for equilibrium is that the clockwise moments must balance the anticlockwise moments. Rearranging F1 × d1 = F2 × d2 gives the relationship for mechanical advantage, which quantifies the force amplification achieved by the lever. Examples of levers in everyday life include a seesaw (children's playground), a crowbar used for lifting, and the beams in a balance scale.",

    "correct_answer": "The center of gravity (CG) is the point at which the total gravitational torque on a body is zero. In a uniform gravitational field, the center of gravity coincides with the center of mass since the gravitational force is the same on each part of the object. For example, when balancing a homogeneous board on a pencil, the board remains horizontal only when the pencil’s tip is directly beneath its center of mass, which is also its center of gravity.",
    "explanation": "When an object is subjected to gravity, each part experiences a gravitational force. The CG is the unique point where these forces produce no net torque. In uniform gravity, since g is constant throughout the object, the weighted position averages yield the center of mass, making it identical to the CG.

In the case of rotation about a fixed axis, if no external torque is applied (τ = 0), the angular momentum is conserved. In experimental setups like the swivel chair demonstration, when a person extends their arms, the moment of inertia increases, requiring a decrease in angular speed to conserve angular momentum. Conversely, when the arms are drawn in, the moment of inertia decreases, and the angular speed increases. This reflects in the equation τ = I × α where, with I constant or changes only due to internal redistribution of mass, any external influences are negligible, and conservation holds.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that by applying dL/dt = τ to a rotating rigid body, we understand that any changes in angular speed (and thus kinetic energy) come from the net external torque.

As a result, the total angular momentum vector in non-symmetric bodies may not be aligned with the fixed rotation axis.",
    "explanation": "The explanation should stress that symmetry ensures cancellation of lateral contributions in L, leaving only the component along the axis.

    "correct_answer": "The derivation begins by considering the total angular momentum L of a rigid body as the sum of the individual angular momenta of all particles, expressed as L = Σ(r × p). For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, one can separate the angular momentum into a component along the axis (Lz) and a perpendicular component (L⊥). For symmetric bodies, L⊥ cancels out due to pairs of particles contributing oppositely. Taking the time derivative of Lz gives dLz/dt = d(Iω)/dt. Assuming the moment of inertia I remains constant (i.e., the body’s shape and mass distribution do not change), the derivative reduces to I(dω/dt) = Iα, where α is the angular acceleration. This rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the net external torque τ acting about the fixed axis. Thus, τ = Iα. Assumptions include constant I and that only the z-component of torque contributes to the change in L for rotation about a fixed axis.",

Since no external torque acts on the system, angular momentum (L = Iω) must be conserved. To maintain constant L, an increase in I results in a decrease in angular velocity ω. Conversely, when the arms are retracted, I decreases and ω increases. This is a practical demonstration of the conservation of angular momentum, where internal reconfiguration of mass leads to a change in rotation rate.",

    "correct_answer": "In a symmetric rigid body, for every particle with a given velocity and position, there exists another particle diametrically opposite with an equal and opposite velocity component. This results in the cancellation of the perpendicular components (L⊥) of angular momentum so that only the component along the fixed axis (Lz) contributes to the net angular momentum (L = Iω). In a non-symmetric body, this cancellation is incomplete because the distribution of mass is uneven; thus, L⊥ does not vanish. As a result, the total angular momentum vector L is not aligned with the axis of rotation but is tilted, incorporating contributions from both the perpendicular and axial components.",

    "correct_answer": "A rigid body undergoing both translation and rotation can be analyzed by separating the motion of its center of mass and its rotation about the center of mass. This approach simplifies problem-solving and helps in understanding how external forces influence overall motion without being disturbed by the internal rotational dynamics.",
    "explanation": "By treating the rigid body as a system of particles, the translational motion (movement of the center of mass) is decoupled from rotational motion. Newton's laws can then be applied to the center of mass motion (using Equation 6.11 for translation) while rotational dynamics are dealt with by considering torques about the center of mass.",

    "correct_answer": "The center of mass continues along its original parabolic path because the explosion involves only internal forces, which do not affect the motion of the center of mass. The external force of gravity remains unchanged and continues to act on the system as a whole.",
    "explanation": "Since internal forces cancel out, they do not affect the acceleration of the center of mass.

    "correct_answer": "Newton's second law applied to the center of mass of a system of particles states that the total mass of the system times the acceleration of the center of mass equals the sum of the external forces acting on the system. Internal forces do not contribute to this equation because they cancel each other out due to Newton's third law. By focusing only on external forces, one can analyze the motion of the center of mass independently from the complex internal interactions.",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins with the definition of the center of mass (M R = m1 r1 + m2 r2 + ... + mn rn) and differentiates it with respect to time to connect the velocity of the center of mass with the velocities of the individual particles (M V = m1 v1 + m2 v2 + ... + mn vn). A further differentiation gives the acceleration relation (M A = m1 a1 + m2 a2 + ... + mn an). By applying Newton's second law (F = m a) to each particle and summing, we form the equation M A = F1 + F2 + ... + Fn. Noting that the internal forces cancel out, we conclude that M A = F_ext. This result implies that the center of mass behaves as if the entire mass were concentrated at that point, with all external forces acting on it.",

    "correct_answer": "The motion of the object’s center of mass is determined solely by the net external forces acting on the system. By treating the entire mass of the object as if it were concentrated at the center of mass, one can apply Newton’s second law (F_ext = M A) without needing to account for the internal forces or rotational components. Internal motions and rotations contribute to the object's kinetic energy and angular momentum, but they do not affect the translational acceleration of the center of mass. This decoupling allows a clear and simplified analysis of translational motion irrespective of internal complexities.",
    "explanation": "This approach is particularly useful because it allows the analysis of the object's overall motion in a gravitational or other external field without getting entangled in the details of internal force distributions. The equation M A = F_ext provides a straightforward way to calculate the acceleration of the center of mass, while any rotational motion is handled separately through torque and moment of inertia considerations.",

    "explanation": "Scalar product: a • b = (2 * -1) + (-1 * 4) + (3 * 2) = -2 - 4 + 6 = 0. For the cross product, use the determinant method: a x b = (a_y*b_z - a_z*b_y, -(a_x*b_z - a_z*b_x), a_x*b_y - a_y*b_x). Computing each term: a_y*b_z - a_z*b_y = (-1*2 - 3*4) = -2 - 12 = -14; a_x*b_z - a_z*b_x = (2*2 - 3*(-1)) = 4 + 3 = 7, so the second component is -7; a_x*b_y - a_y*b_x = (2*4 - (-1)*(-1)) = 8 - 1 = 7. Therefore, a x b = (-14, -7, 7) and by anti-commutation, b x a = (14, 7, -7), confirming the property.",
