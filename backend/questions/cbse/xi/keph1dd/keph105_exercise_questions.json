    "question_text": "The sign of work done by a force on a body is important to understand. State carefully if the following quantities are positive or negative: (a) work done by a man in lifting a bucket out of a well by means of a rope tied to the bucket; (b) work done by the gravitational force in the above case; (c) work done by friction on a body sliding down an inclined plane; (d) work done by an applied force on a body moving on a rough horizontal plane with uniform velocity; (e) work done by the resistive force of air on a vibrating pendulum in bringing it to rest.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Positive; (b) Negative; (c) Negative; (d) Positive; (e) Negative.",
    "explanation": "When a man lifts a bucket, his applied force and displacement are in the same direction so the work is positive. The gravitational force opposes the upward displacement, so its work is negative. Friction always opposes motion, hence negative. In uniform motion on a rough horizontal plane the applied force (which balances friction) does positive work over the displacement, while friction does negative work. The resistive force of air removes energy from a vibrating pendulum, so its work is negative.",

    "explanation": "Assuming g = 10 m/s², the friction force = μmg = 0.1 × 2 × 10 = 2 N. The net force is 7 N - 2 N = 5 N, giving an acceleration a = 5/2 = 2.5 m/s². The displacement during 10 s is s = 0.5 × 2.5 × (10²) = 125 m. Thus, work done by the applied force = 7 × 125 = 875 J, work done by friction = -2 × 125 = -250 J, so net work = 875 - 250 = 625 J.

    "explanation": "Each lift requires work = mgh = 10×10×0.5 = 50 J. Over 1000 lifts, the total work is 50,000 J. With only 20% efficiency, the energy required from fat is 50,000 J / 0.2 = 250,000 J. Since fat provides 3.8×10^7 J/kg, the mass of fat used is 250,000 J / (3.8×10^7 J/kg) ≈ 0.00658 kg, or about 6.6 g.",

    "explanation": "With an incident energy of 200 W/m² and 20% efficiency, the useful power per square meter is 40 W/m². To supply 8000 W, the required area is 8000/40 = 200 m². This is often larger than the roof area of a typical house.",
