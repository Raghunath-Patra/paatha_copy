    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton observed that the acceleration of falling objects on Earth (approximately 9.8 m/s²) is much larger than the centripetal acceleration of the Moon in its orbit. By calculating the Moon's acceleration using a_m = 4π²R_m / T² and noting that it is considerably smaller, he inferred that the gravitational force weakens with increasing distance. This led him to propose that gravitational acceleration follows an inverse-square law with distance from Earth's center.",
    "explanation": "The explanation involves recognizing that the Moon, being far away, experiences a much lower acceleration compared to objects on Earth. Newton’s reasoning was supported by the empirical values for the Moon's orbit (R_m and T). By comparing the equations for gravitational acceleration at Earth's surface (g ∝ 1/R_E²) and the Moon's centripetal acceleration (a_m ∝ 1/R_m²), he confirmed that g / a_m = R_m² / R_E², establishing the inverse square law.",

    "correct_answer": "The calculation involves integrating the contributions from all the infinitesimal elements (dm) of the extended object. For each element, the force dF = G*m*dm/ r^2 is computed, taking into account its direction. When integrated over the volume or surface, the total force is obtained as a vector sum. The two special cases are: (1) For a uniform hollow spherical shell, the gravitational force on a point mass outside the shell is the same as if the entire mass were concentrated at the center; (2) For a point mass located inside the shell, the net gravitational force is zero due to symmetric cancellation.",
    "explanation": "The method uses calculus to sum the gravitational effects of different parts of the extended body by breaking it down into differential mass elements. In the first special case, symmetry allows the entire mass of the shell to be assumed at the center when calculating the force on an external point mass. In the second case, the contributions from all parts of a spherical shell cancel each other out when the point mass is inside, resulting in zero net force. These conclusions are well-established in gravitational theory.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Due to the symmetric placement of the equal masses at the vertices of the equilateral triangle, the gravitational forces they exert on the mass at the centroid are equal in magnitude but directed along angles that lead to mutual cancellation. The horizontal components cancel out because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, and similarly, the vertical components also cancel, resulting in a net force of zero.",
    "explanation": "The symmetry of the equilateral triangle ensures that the distance from each vertex to the centroid is the same and that the angles between the forces are set such that when the vector components are added, they sum to zero.
