Since Newton's third law tells us F_12 = -F_21, adding the two equations yields (p'_1 - p_1) + (p'_2 - p_2) = 0, implying p'_1 + p'_2 = p_1 + p_2. This shows that the total momentum is conserved.",
    "explanation": "The derivation uses the impulse-momentum theorem, which relates the impulse (force multiplied by the time interval during which the force acts) to the change in momentum.

However, for elastic collisions, kinetic energy is also conserved; the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total kinetic energy after. In inelastic collisions, some kinetic energy is lost (converted into heat, sound, or deformation), even though the total momentum remains constant. For example, a collision between billiard balls is nearly elastic, whereas a car crash is an inelastic collision.",
    "explanation": "This answer distinguishes between the two collision types. Elastic collisions maintain both momentum and kinetic energy, making them easier to analyze using both conservation laws. In inelastic collisions, while momentum is conserved, kinetic energy is not because some energy is transformed into other forms, which is why additional analysis is required beyond just momentum conservation.",
