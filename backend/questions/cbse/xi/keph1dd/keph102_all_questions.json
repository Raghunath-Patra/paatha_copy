In the case of a railway carriage moving smoothly and a monkey seated on a cycling man (both moving on nearly straight paths with displacement far exceeding their sizes), the point particle approximation is valid.

(ii) In 50 min (0.833 h), he has walked to the market in 0.5 h and returned 0.333 h at 7.5 km/h (covering 2.5 km), so his net displacement is zero and average velocity is 0 km/h, while average speed is (2.5 + 2.5)/0.833 ≈ 6 km/h. (iii) In 40 min (0.667 h), after reaching the market, he has been on his return for 10 min (0.167 h) covering 1.25 km; thus, displacement = 2.5 - 1.25 = 1.25 km, so average velocity = 1.25/0.667 ≈ 1.87 km/h, and average speed = (2.5 + 1.25)/0.667 ≈ 5.63 km/h.",

For example, in uniform circular motion, although the speed remains constant, the continuous change in direction results in a centripetal acceleration directed towards the center of the circle.",
    "explanation": "Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. Since velocity encompasses both magnitude and direction, any change in direction leads to a change in velocity.

    "explanation": "When sampling position–time data, experimental errors such as instrumental inaccuracy, human error in reading values, or noise can affect the computed velocity. A larger Δt smoothens fluctuations but may not capture the true instantaneous rate, whereas a very small Δt may not be practical due to resolution limitations.
