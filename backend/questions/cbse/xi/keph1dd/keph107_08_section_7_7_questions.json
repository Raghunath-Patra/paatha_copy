In the context of gravity, the gravitational force is conservative because the work done by gravity only depends on the initial and final positions, allowing the definition of gravitational potential energy as a position-dependent function.",
    "explanation": "A conservative force, like gravity, has the important property that the work done in moving a particle between two points depends solely on the end points and not the path taken. This allows us to define a potential energy function such that the change in potential energy equals the work done by the force.

    "explanation": "Close to Earth's surface, the gravitational acceleration is nearly constant, hence the potential energy is linear with height.

This approach simplifies analyses of complex systems and is essential for understanding interactions in many-body systems.",
    "explanation": "When dealing with multiple particles, potential energy from each unique interaction between pairs of masses contributes to the total.
