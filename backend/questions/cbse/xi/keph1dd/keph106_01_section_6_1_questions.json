    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In rotational motion about a fixed axis, each particle of the rigid body moves in a circular path within a plane that is perpendicular to the axis. The linear velocity (v) of any point is given by the product of the angular velocity (omega) and its distance (r) from the axis (v = r * omega). This means that points located farther from the axis move faster in terms of linear speed, even though the entire body shares the same angular velocity.",
    "explanation": "The kinematics of rotational motion involves describing the circular paths each point takes. Because each point moves with speed proportional to its radial distance (r), the variation in linear speed is inherent. This is crucial when analyzing forces or energy in rotating systems. The relation v = r * omega is a fundamental equation in rotational motion and helps explain why, for instance, the outer edge of a spinning disc moves faster than points near the centre.",

    "correct_answer": "Pure translational motion is characterized by every particle in the body having the same velocity at every instant, as seen in the example of a block sliding down an inclined plane. In this case, the orientation of the object does not change. In contrast, a combination of translation and rotation involves the centre of mass moving along a path while the body also rotates about its centre of mass, like a rolling cylinder. In the rolling cylinder, different points on the body have different instantaneous velocities, and the point of contact with the surface is momentarily at rest. This combination leads to more complex dynamics where rotational kinetic energy must also be considered.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the distribution of velocity throughout the body. Pure translation implies uniform motion without rotation, whereas combined motion involves added rotational effects. Understanding both motions requires separating the translational movement of the centre of mass from the rotational motion about it. The examples from the textbook (sliding block vs. rolling cylinder) clearly illustrate these differences.",

For a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia I = (1/2)*m*R² = 0.5*2*(0.2)² = 0.04 kg*m². The total kinetic energy at the bottom is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energies: KE_total = (1/2)*m*v² + (1/2)*I*(v²/(R²)). Substituting I and R, the rotational KE becomes (1/2)*0.04*(v²/0.04) = 0.5*v². Thus, KE_total = v² + 0.5*v² = 1.5*v². Setting the potential energy equal to the total kinetic energy, 49 J = 1.5*v², we get v² = 49/1.5 ≈ 32.67, which gives v ≈ sqrt(32.67) ≈ 5.7 m/s.",
