This confirms that gravitational acceleration decreases in proportion to the inverse square of the distance.",

    "correct_answer": "The vector addition technique involves treating the gravitational force from each individual point mass as a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction. By using Newton's gravitational law for each pair, the individual forces are computed. These vectors are then added using the rules of vector addition. In diagrams like Figures 7.4 and 7.5, the forces along the same line or in opposite directions can cancel, while other components combine to yield the resultant force on the point mass. This method ensures that all directional components are properly accounted for.",
    "explanation": "The process typically involves decomposing each force vector into its components along the coordinate axes, summing the components independently, and then recombining them to reconstruct the total force vector.

    "correct_answer": "The derivation begins by equating the centripetal acceleration of the moon in its orbit to the gravitational acceleration due to the Earth. The formula aₘ = (4π² Rₘ) / (T²) is derived from the circular motion relationship (v = 2πRₘ/T) and then compared to the acceleration due to gravity on the Earth's surface, which obeys an inverse square relation. The fact that aₘ is much less than Earth's surface gravity (g) and that the ratio g/aₘ equals (Rₘ²)/(Rₑ²) confirms that gravitational influence decreases with the square of the distance from the Earth's center.",
    "explanation": "This comparison highlights the fundamental nature of the inverse square law. The use of actual measurements for Rₘ, T, and Rₑ shows that the predicted value for aₘ aligns with the observed force, validating the assumption that the gravitational force diminishes as 1/r².",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton assumed that bodies could be modeled as point masses when applying his law of gravitation. This approximation works well for objects with a spherically symmetric mass distribution because, as shown through integration (or by the shell theorem), the gravitational influence of a spherical shell on an external point mass is the same as if the entire mass were concentrated at the center. For a point mass inside such a spherical shell, the net gravitational force cancels out to zero. This treatment addresses the complications arising from extended objects by allowing simplification through symmetry and integration methods.",
