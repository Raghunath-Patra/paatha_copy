    "correct_answer": "The shell theorem states that for any spherical shell of mass, the net gravitational force exerted on a point mass inside the shell is zero. This allows us to ignore the contribution of shells with radii greater than the point's distance from the center. For a uniform density Earth, only the mass enclosed within radius r contributes to the gravitational force. Since the enclosed mass M_r is proportional to r^3 (M_r = (4/3)πρr^3) and the force is given by F = GmM_r/r^2, substituting for M_r gives F ∝ r. This linear dependence of force on r implies that the gravitational acceleration g inside the Earth increases linearly with r.",
    "explanation": "By applying the shell theorem, we eliminate the gravitational contributions from layers outside the radius of interest. With a uniform density, the mass within a sphere of radius r is proportional to r^3, and when substituted in the gravitational force formula, it results in a force that is directly proportional to r. This explains why if you move from the center to the surface of the Earth, the gravitational force (and thus acceleration) increases linearly with distance.",

    "correct_answer": "A uniform density model simplifies calculations, but the actual Earth has a non-uniform density distribution with denser materials near the core and less dense materials near the crust. This model may therefore lead to inaccuracies when predicting gravitational acceleration in regions where the density significantly deviates from the average. Advanced models that account for density variations provide more precise predictions of gravitational forces at different depths.",
    "explanation": "The uniform density assumption is an idealization that ignores the complex internal structure of the Earth. In reality, the Earth’s core, mantle, and crust have different densities, leading to variations in the gravitational field that a simple model cannot capture. These discrepancies are particularly important when precise measurements are required, such as in geophysical studies or detailed modeling of Earth's interior.",
