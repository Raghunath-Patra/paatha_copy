For a body rotating about a fixed axis, if you curl the fingers in the direction of the rotation, your thumb indicates the direction of the angular velocity vector along the axis of rotation.",
    "explanation": "In rotational dynamics, every particle of a rigid body rotates in a circle. Although angular velocity initially appears as a scalar rate (dθ/dt), it is more accurately represented as a vector to capture the direction of rotation. Using the right-hand rule, one points the fingers in the direction of rotation; the thumb then points along the axis in the direction of the angular velocity vector.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same linear velocity at an instant, meaning the entire body shifts uniformly in space without changing its orientation. In pure rotation, every particle moves in a circular path about a fixed axis and all particles share the same angular velocity at an instant, though their linear speeds differ according to their distance from the axis. For example, a sliding block is a case of pure translation, while a spinning merry-go-round exhibits pure rotation.",
    "explanation": "A rigid body in translation has every point moving in parallel paths with identical speeds and directions. This uniformity does not apply in rotation: while the angular velocity remains constant throughout the body, the linear velocity of each particle is given by v = ω r, where r is the particle's distance from the rotation axis. Thus, particles further from the axis move faster, although the rate of rotation (angular velocity) is the same for all particles. These distinctions are crucial for analyzing dynamics in different types of motion.",
