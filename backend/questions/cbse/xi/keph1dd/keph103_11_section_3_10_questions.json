    "correct_answer": "To derive centripetal acceleration, consider an object moving along a circular path with constant speed v. At two nearby positions P and P' separated by a small angle Δθ, the velocity vectors v and v' are tangent to the circle. Since the magnitude of velocity remains constant, the change in velocity Δv is due to the change in direction. By constructing a vector triangle with Δv, and using similar triangles formed by the position vectors, we find that |Δv|/v = |Δr|/R, where |Δr| is the arc length approximated by vΔt. Taking the limit as Δt approaches zero leads to a_c = lim(Δt→0)(|Δv|/Δt) = v²/R. This derivation shows that the acceleration is always directed towards the center of the circle.",
    "explanation": "The derivation uses the concept of similar triangles and the fact that for small angles, the arc length approximates the distance traveled.
