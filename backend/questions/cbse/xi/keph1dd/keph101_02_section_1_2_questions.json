    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Redefining SI base units using fundamental constants means that units are based on invariant properties of nature rather than physical artifacts. For example, the metre is defined by fixing the value of the speed of light, and the kilogram is defined by fixing the value of the Planck constant. This ensures greater precision, consistency, and accuracy in measurement across the globe.",
    "explanation": "By defining units in terms of fundamental constants, variations due to physical changes in measurement standards are eliminated. The metre, based on the speed of light in vacuum, and the kilogram, based on the Planck constant, are now tied directly to unchanging universal constants. This not only improves the precision of measurements as technology evolves but also ensures that comparisons of measurements are consistent over time and among different laboratories.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The ampere is defined by fixing the numerical value of the elementary charge. In this definition, one coulomb is the product of the ampere and one second, linking electric current to time. By specifying the elementary charge as a constant, the ampere becomes fundamentally connected to the behavior of charged particles, thus integrating electromagnetic measurements with other SI base units such as the second. This interdependence reinforces the consistency and precision of the SI system.",
    "explanation": "The ampere is not an isolated definition but is linked systematically to other units. Defining it through the elementary charge (which is fixed to a precise value) ensures that the measurement of current is directly related to a fundamental physical property. This aids measurements across experiments and technologies, ensuring interoperability and precision in both theoretical and applied physics.",
