It represents the net effect of movement and is essential in determining resultant movements, velocities, and accelerations. Unlike the actual path traveled, which may be long and curved, the displacement vector is concerned only with the shortest distance between two points, simplifying calculations in mechanics.",
    "explanation": "By focusing on the net change in position, the displacement vector allows us to analyze motions without getting bogged down by the complexities of the path taken.

    "correct_answer": "Two vectors are considered equal if and only if they have identical magnitudes and directions. For example, consider vector A pointing east with a magnitude of 5 units and vector B also of 5 units but pointing north. Even though their magnitudes are the same, their directions differ, so they are not equal. To check for equality, one may also displace the vectors via parallel translation; if after translation their initial and terminal points coincide, they are equal.",
