By using vectors, one can easily apply mathematical operations to solve problems related to motion, such as projectile motion and circular motion, and extend these analyses to three dimensions by simply adding another component.",
    "explanation": "In analyzing planar motion, vectors provide a framework that captures both the size and the direction of quantities like displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Each of these quantities is represented as a vector so that they can be decomposed along perpendicular axes, making it easier to apply the principles of kinematics. This approach not only simplifies problem solving but also facilitates extension of the analysis to three-dimensional contexts, where an additional coordinate (z-axis) is incorporated.

    "correct_answer": "Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to the acceleration due to gravity. The assumptions typically include neglecting air resistance and considering gravity as the only force acting on the object, resulting in a constant acceleration in the vertical direction. This analysis is significant because it provides insights into the behavior of objects under uniform acceleration and has applications in various fields including sports, engineering, and ballistics.",
    "explanation": "Projectile motion is characterized by a two-dimensional motion where the horizontal component of velocity remains constant (assuming no air resistance) and the vertical component is uniformly accelerated due to gravity. By decomposing the motion into horizontal and vertical components, one can apply the kinematic equations to analyze the path of the projectile. The assumption of constant gravitational acceleration simplifies the analysis and allows for the derivation of key parameters such as time of flight, maximum height, and horizontal range. This study not only deepens our understanding of motion under uniform acceleration but also has practical implications in many real-world applications.",
