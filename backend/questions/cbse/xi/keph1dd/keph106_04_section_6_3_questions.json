    "correct_answer": "When a projectile explodes, the explosion is driven by internal forces which, according to Newton's third law, cancel each other out. Therefore, they do not contribute to the net force on the system. The only net force acting on the system is gravity, an external force. As a result, the acceleration of the centre of mass remains unchanged even though the individual fragments follow different trajectories. Consequently, the centre of mass continues along the original parabolic path determined solely by gravity.",
    "explanation": "The explanation is based on the principle that internal forces do not affect the motion of the centre of mass because of their mutual cancellation.

However, the limitations arise when internal forces or moments (torques) play a significant role in the system's behavior, in which case a more detailed analysis beyond the centre of mass approximation is necessary.",
