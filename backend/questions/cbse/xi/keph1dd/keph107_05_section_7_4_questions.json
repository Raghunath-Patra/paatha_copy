    "correct_answer": "Cavendish's experiment uses a torsional balance where a bar with small lead spheres is suspended by a fine wire. Large lead spheres are positioned near the small spheres, and their gravitational attraction creates a force F = G(Mm)/d^2. These forces generate a torque on the bar equal to F multiplied by the bar length L. Concurrently, the twisting wire exerts a restoring torque proportional to the angle of twist (tau multiplied by theta). At equilibrium, the gravitational torque equals the restoring torque, allowing G to be calculated using the relation G(Mm)/d^2 * L = tau * theta.",
    "explanation": "The experiment carefully balances the gravitational torque with the restoring torque from the twisted wire. By accurately measuring the angle of twist theta and knowing the torsion constant tau, along with the masses and distances, G can be computed.

    "correct_answer": "Since G is directly proportional to the measured angle theta, any error in theta directly translates to an error in G. For instance, if theta is overestimated by a certain percentage, G will be overestimated by the same percentage. Thus, high precision in measuring theta is crucial to accurately determine G.",
    "explanation": "The equilibrium equation is G(Mm)/d^2 * L = tau * theta. This linear relationship means that measurement uncertainty in theta propagates directly to G.
