Its role is to constrain the bob's motion along the circular path and provide the centripetal force needed for circular motion, but it does not change the bob's kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "Even though the tension is a significant force in providing the necessary centripetal acceleration for circular motion, it does not alter the mechanical energy of the system because it always acts perpendicular to the direction of motion.
