    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "While dimensional analysis is a powerful tool for checking the consistency of equations and deducing relations among physical quantities, it has limitations. It cannot determine numerical constants, distinguish between different physical phenomena that share the same dimensions, or capture the detailed dynamics of a system. As such, it fails to provide complete information in cases where underlying physics, non-dimensionless factors, or complex interactions are involved.",
    "explanation": "Dimensional analysis only verifies that the units on both sides of an equation are consistent. It doesn't determine the magnitude of dimensionless constants (such as 2π in the pendulum formula) and cannot distinguish between equations that are dimensionally similar but physically different. Additionally, it cannot address situations involving functions (like trigonometric functions) which require dimensionless arguments. Therefore, while useful, its application is limited to providing preliminary checks and proportional relationships.",

    "explanation": "In a correct physical formula, every term must share the same dimensions. The expression a = F/m is dimensionally consistent because it yields acceleration with dimensions [L T^-2].

    "correct_answer": "To determine the overall uncertainty in the area of a rectangle, first calculate the area by multiplying the measured dimensions. Then, determine the relative uncertainties of each dimension and add them to estimate the relative uncertainty in the product. Finally, convert this back to an absolute uncertainty. For example: Area = 16.2 cm × 10.1 cm = 163.62 cm². The relative uncertainties are (0.1/16.2) ≈ 0.0062 and (0.1/10.1) ≈ 0.0099. Adding these gives a total relative uncertainty of approximately 0.0161. Multiplying 163.62 cm² by 0.0161 gives about 2.63 cm², which can be rounded to 3 cm².
