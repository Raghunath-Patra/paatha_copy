    "question_text": "The sign of work done by a force on a body is important to understand. State carefully if the following quantities are positive or negative: (a) work done by a man in lifting a bucket out of a well by means of a rope tied to the bucket; (b) work done by the gravitational force in the above case; (c) work done by friction on a body sliding down an inclined plane; (d) work done by an applied force on a body moving on a rough horizontal plane with uniform velocity; (e) work done by the resistive force of air on a vibrating pendulum in bringing it to rest.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Positive; (b) Negative; (c) Negative; (d) Positive; (e) Negative.",
    "explanation": "When a man lifts a bucket, his applied force and displacement are in the same direction so the work is positive. The gravitational force opposes the upward displacement, so its work is negative. Friction always opposes motion, hence negative. In uniform motion on a rough horizontal plane the applied force (which balances friction) does positive work over the displacement, while friction does negative work. The resistive force of air removes energy from a vibrating pendulum, so its work is negative.",

    "explanation": "Assuming g = 10 m/s², the friction force = μmg = 0.1 × 2 × 10 = 2 N. The net force is 7 N - 2 N = 5 N, giving an acceleration a = 5/2 = 2.5 m/s². The displacement during 10 s is s = 0.5 × 2.5 × (10²) = 125 m. Thus, work done by the applied force = 7 × 125 = 875 J, work done by friction = -2 × 125 = -250 J, so net work = 875 - 250 = 625 J.

Newton's second law, expressed in vector form, accounts for the individual components of force and acceleration. As a result, while the work-energy theorem can be used to determine changes in the energy state of a system, it does not provide information about the direction of motion or resolve forces into components. This limitation can restrict its use in complex systems where directional forces (such as friction, drag, or magnetic forces) are critical for understanding the complete dynamics.",

Recognizing that v = dx/dt, this expression transforms into dK = F dx. Integrating both sides from the initial to final positions, the result is Kf - Ki = ∫(xi to xf) F dx.

At very high speeds, corrections from Einstein's theory of relativity become significant, because the increase in mass and the effects of time dilation mean that the simple 1/2 m v^2 equation no longer accurately represents the kinetic energy.

For example, when you push against a brick wall, you may feel tired (indicating you are expending energy), but since the wall does not move, no work is done in the physics sense. On the other hand, when a cyclist skids to a stop due to friction, the frictional force does negative work because it acts opposite to the direction of motion, resulting in a loss of kinetic energy.",

However, work is defined as the product of the force and the displacement in the direction of that force. In Example 5.3, while the road applies a 200 N force over a displacement of 10 m (resulting in -2000 J of work because the force opposes the displacement), the cycle does not move the road at all; hence, the displacement is zero and the work done by the cycle on the road is 0 J. This discrepancy shows that equal and opposite forces do not necessarily result in equal and opposite work.",

In physics, work is strictly defined as the product of a force and the displacement in the direction of that force, energy is the capacity to do work, and power is the rate at which work is performed. For example, a farmer ploughing a field is said to be working in everyday terms, but quantitatively, the work done is calculated by the force applied and the displacement achieved.",

    "correct_answer": "The cosine term in the scalar product, A dot B = A × B × cosθ, quantifies how much of one vector lies in the direction of the other. When the angle between the vectors is small, cosθ is close to 1, meaning the vectors are nearly parallel and the product is large; when the angle is 90°, cosθ is zero, so there is no projection; and when the angle is greater than 90°, the cosine is negative, indicating that the projection is in the opposite direction.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains that cosine serves as a measure of alignment between two vectors. This determines the effective component of one vector in the direction of the other.

    "correct_answer": "During free fall, as a ball is dropped from a height H, its gravitational potential energy (mgH) is converted into kinetic energy (½mv²) as it accelerates toward the ground. At the beginning, when the ball is at height H, its kinetic energy is zero and its potential energy is maximum. As the ball falls, potential energy decreases while kinetic energy increases such that the sum remains constant (mgH = ½mv² + mg(h)). This conversion can be illustrated in a diagram where the ball's energy state is shown at height H, an intermediate height h, and just before impact at the ground. The conservation of mechanical energy principle ensures that any loss in potential energy will be exactly balanced by an equivalent gain in kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "The explanation comes from the energy conservation formula: initial potential energy equals the sum of kinetic and potential energies at any subsequent point (mgH = ½mv² + mgh).

Therefore, ½*1.5*v² = 294 J leads to v² = (294*2)/1.5 = 392 and v ≈ √392 ≈ 19.8 m/s. At ground level, all energy is kinetic: ½*1.5*v² = 441 J, leading to v² = (441*2)/1.5 = 588, and v ≈ √588 ≈ 24.2 m/s.",

    "correct_answer": "In a system where only conservative forces (such as gravity) are present, the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy remains constant. This is because any decrease in potential energy results in an equivalent increase in kinetic energy, thus conserving the total mechanical energy.",

    "correct_answer": "When a ball of mass m is raised to a height h, it gains a gravitational potential energy of mgh. When released, this stored energy is converted into kinetic energy. Using conservation of energy, we equate the potential energy to the kinetic energy at the bottom: 1/2 mv² = mgh. Solving for v gives v = sqrt(2gh). This derivation shows that the loss in potential energy equals the gain in kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "This problem involves energy conversion. Initially, the ball has potential energy mgh and zero kinetic energy. As it falls, the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases. By energy conservation, the total energy remains constant so that mgh (initial potential energy) equals 1/2 mv² (kinetic energy at the ground). This leads to the equation 1/2 mv² = mgh and the derived speed v = sqrt(2gh).",

    "correct_answer": "For a conservative force acting in one dimension, the work done when moving an object from x1 to x2 is given by W = ∫[x1 to x2] F(x) dx. By definition, this work is equal to -(V(x2) - V(x1)). Equating the integrals, we have ∫[x1 to x2] F(x) dx = -∫[V(x1) to V(x2)] dV. Differentiating both sides with respect to x gives F(x) = -dV/dx. This indicates that the force is always directed towards regions of lower potential energy.",
    "explanation": "In conservative systems, the potential energy function V(x) is defined such that its derivative gives the force by F(x) = -dV/dx. This derivation shows that the energy lost by an object as it moves in the force field is stored as an increase in kinetic energy. The negative sign confirms that the force is directed opposite to the increase of potential energy, which is consistent with the tendency of systems to move toward lower energy states.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "26000 W",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the total force: F = mg + frictional force = (1000 kg × 10 m/s²) + 3000 N = 10000 N + 3000 N = 13000 N. Then, power P = F × v = 13000 N × 2 m/s = 26000 W.",

    "correct_answer": "Energy = 2.5 kWh = 9,000,000 J",
    "explanation": "First, convert 5 hours to seconds if using joules: 5 hours = 5 × 3600 s = 18000 s. Energy in joules = power × time = 500 W × 18000 s = 9,000,000 J. To convert 500 W over 5 hours to kWh, note that 500 W = 0.5 kW, so energy = 0.5 kW × 5 h = 2.5 kWh.",
