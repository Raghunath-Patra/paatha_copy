    "explanation": "Start with the energy conservation equation: ½ m v_i² - (GMm/R) = 0. Cancel m from both terms. This yields ½ v_i² = GM/R. Multiply both sides by 2 to get v_i² = 2GM/R, and then take the square root to obtain v_i = √(2GM/R). Finally, substitute GM = gR² to obtain v_i = √(2gR).

    "explanation": "For the neutral point, set (G M m/r²) = (4G M m/(6R - r)²). Solving gives r = 2R. Next, write the energy at the starting point: E_initial = ½ m v² - (GMm/R) - (4GMm/(5R)) (since the distance from the projectile to the second sphere is 5R when launched from the surface of the first sphere) and the energy at the neutral point is purely potential.
