    "correct_answer": "Calculating acceleration from velocity components by differentiating each component with respect to time (a_x = dv_x/dt and a_y = dv_y/dt) works well for both uniform and non-uniform motion, especially in rectilinear motion. However, when dealing with highly non-uniform or rapidly changing curved motion, the acceleration vector may not point in the same direction as the net change in velocity because other components such as centripetal acceleration come into play. This method assumes that the velocity components change smoothly over time and that the time intervals are sufficiently small to make the derivative a good approximation.",
