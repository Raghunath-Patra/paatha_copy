    "correct_answer": "Reducing Δt narrows the time interval over which the average velocity is computed, making the secant line between two nearby points on the curve approach the tangent at the specific instant. In the limit as Δt tends to zero, the secant becomes the tangent, and the slope of this tangent line represents the instantaneous velocity.",
    "explanation": "The process is based on the principle of limits in calculus. With a large Δt, the average velocity (slope of the secant) reflects changes in velocity over the interval. As Δt decreases, these changes are minimized and the computed average velocity converges to the instantaneous rate of change at the exact point.

Graphical methods, while conceptually intuitive, can be limited by the accuracy of the drawn graph and the difficulty in obtaining precise slopes from tangents on a plotted curve.",
