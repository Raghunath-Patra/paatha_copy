Galileo challenged this view by proposing a frictionless world, where he demonstrated that an object in motion would continue moving uniformly unless acted upon by an external force. This idea laid the groundwork for Newton's first law of motion, fundamentally changing the approach to understanding dynamics.",
    "explanation": "Aristotle's view was based on observations affected by friction, leading to the misconception that motion requires constant force. Galileo's thought experiments removed the friction factor, showing that in an idealized frictionless environment, motion remains uniform.
