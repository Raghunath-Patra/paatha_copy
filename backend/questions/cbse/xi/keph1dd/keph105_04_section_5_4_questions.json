    "explanation": "In work-energy calculations, the formula K = 1/2 m × v² depends only on the square of speed.

This energy loss indicates that 90% of the bullet's kinetic energy was absorbed or expended during its passage through the plywood, demonstrating significant energy dissipation due to resistance.",
    "explanation": "The calculation begins with the bullet's initial kinetic energy: 1/2 × 0.05 kg × (200 m/s)² = 1000 J. After passing through the plywood, only 10% of the initial energy remains, so the final kinetic energy is 100 J.

    "correct_answer": "The derivation of K = 1/2 m × v² starts with the work done on an object. When a force acts on an object causing a displacement, the work done (W) is defined as the force times the displacement. Using kinematics and the definition of acceleration, one can relate the work done to the change in velocity. By integrating the force over the distance while considering acceleration, the formula for kinetic energy emerges as 1/2 m × v².",
    "explanation": "Work is the integral of force over distance. For a constant force that causes an acceleration, using the work-energy theorem, the work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy. By substituting in the definitions of acceleration and displacement, and performing the integration, one arrives at the expression K = 1/2 m × v².
