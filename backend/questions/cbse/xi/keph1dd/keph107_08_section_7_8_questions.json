Next, recognize that g = GM_E/R_E² so that GM_E = gR_E². Substituting, V_min² = 2gR_E²/R_E = 2gR_E. Therefore, V_min = sqrt(2gR_E).",

At infinity, the gravitational potential energy is taken as zero reference and all initial kinetic energy has been converted, leaving the projectile with zero kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "When an object is launched with exactly the escape speed, its initial kinetic energy ½ m V_esc² offsets the gravitational potential energy -GM_E m/R_E. As the object moves farther away, gravitational force does work against its motion, causing the kinetic energy to decrease while the potential energy increases (becomes less negative). At infinity, the sum of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy equals zero, and since the potential energy is defined as zero at infinity, the kinetic energy must also be zero. This explains the energy conversion process.",

    "explanation": "The derivation of escape speed relies on several key assumptions: (1) The planet is treated as a point mass or spherically symmetric body, which allows the gravitational potential energy to be expressed as -GMm/r; (2) No other forces such as air resistance or drag are present; (3) The effect of rotation and other perturbative forces are ignored; (4) Energy is conserved.
