The torque, being perpendicular to the angular momentum, induces a rotational change that is observable as precession.",
    "explanation": "In the experiment, the rim has an inherent angular momentum due to its fast rotation. When one of the supporting strings is released or repositioned, an external torque is generated. According to the relation d(L)/dt = tau, this torque causes the angular momentum vector to change its direction. Since the torque is perpendicular to L, the change does not affect the magnitude but alters the direction, resulting in the precession of the rotation axis of the rim.
