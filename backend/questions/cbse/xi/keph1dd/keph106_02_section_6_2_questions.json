    "correct_answer": "The centre of mass of a rigid body is determined by treating the body as a continuous distribution of mass. Initially, the body is considered as being made up of small mass elements, and the centre of mass is given by the weighted sum of positions divided by total mass. As the number of elements increases and their mass decreases, this summation becomes an integral: R = (1/M) ∫ r dm. Integration over the volume or area accounts for the continuous variation in the mass distribution.",
    "explanation": "When a body is composed of a very large number of particles, it is impractical to sum over each individual mass element. By dividing the body into infinitesimally small mass elements dm, and taking the limit as these elements become infinitely small, the discrete summation is replaced by an integral. This method, R = (1/M) ∫ r dm, is not only mathematically elegant but also highly efficient for irregular bodies or those with non-uniform distributions.",

    "correct_answer": "To determine the centre of mass of an L-shaped lamina with three squares of different masses, first calculate the centre of mass of each square (which is at its geometric centre due to uniformity). Then treat each square as a point mass located at its centre. Use the discrete centre of mass formula: X = (m1*x1 + m2*x2 + m3*x3) / (m1 + m2 + m3) and Y = (m1*y1 + m2*y2 + m3*y3) / (m1 + m2 + m3), where m1, m2, m3 are the masses and (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) are the coordinates of the centres. Finally, combine these to find the overall centre of mass of the lamina.",
    "explanation": "The method involves first identifying the centre of mass for each individual square and then using the weighted average formula for discrete masses.
