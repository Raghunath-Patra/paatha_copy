    "correct_answer": "In a circular orbit, the distance between the planet and the central body remains constant so the speed is constant and the area swept per unit time is uniform. In an elliptical orbit, the planet's distance from the Sun varies; it speeds up near the perihelion and slows down near the aphelion. Although the instantaneous speed changes, the rate of area swept (areal velocity) remains constant due to conservation of angular momentum.",
    "explanation": "Circular orbits are a special case of ellipses where the two foci coincide, leading to uniform motion. Elliptical orbits, by contrast, introduce variations in distance and hence speed. However, the law of areas ensures that despite these speed variations, the area swept per unit time stays constant.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Under a central gravitational force, the torque on the planet is zero because the force always acts along the line joining the planet and the Sun. Hence, the planet's angular momentum (given by r × p) remains constant. Since the areal velocity is expressed as (r × v)/2 and v = p/m, it can be shown that the area swept per time interval, ΔA/Δt, is proportional to the constant angular momentum divided by 2m. Thus, regardless of the changes in r and v during the elliptical orbit, the areal velocity remains constant.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts by recognizing that no net torque exists in a central force field, meaning angular momentum L = r × (m*v) is conserved. The areal velocity is given by ΔA/Δt = L/(2m). Since both L and m are constant, ΔA/Δt is a constant value. This is the foundation of Kepler's Second Law, which states that a line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.",
