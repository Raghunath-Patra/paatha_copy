    "correct_answer": "In everyday language, 'work' often refers to any activity that involves effort, such as physical labor or mental exercise. In physics, however, work is specifically defined as the product of the force component in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of displacement (W = F cosθ d). For example, pushing against a rigid brick wall may feel tiring due to energy expenditure in the muscles, but no work is done on the wall because it does not move.",
    "explanation": "The physics definition of work is quantitative and requires displacement. In contrast, daily usage of the term 'work' may refer to any exertion of force or effort regardless of movement.

A real-world example is a cyclist coming to a stop due to frictional force acting opposite to the direction of motion.",
    "explanation": "Start from the definition of work as the dot product of force and displacement. The dot product is F d cosθ. When the force is opposed to the displacement (θ > 90°), cosθ becomes negative, indicating that the force is extracting energy from the system.
