This directly influenced Newton's formulation of the First Law of Motion, which states that a body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force. Galileo's frictionless scenarios provided a clear example of pure inertia, thereby bridging experimental evidence with theoretical mechanics.",
    "explanation": "The experiments, especially those involving the double inclined plane, demonstrated that when friction is negligible, the energy transfer between potential and kinetic energy is nearly ideal, and an object will not decelerate on its own.

    "correct_answer": "Ancient Indian science described various types of forces using terms such as nodan (continuous pressure), abhighat (impact), sanskara (persistent tendency), and vega (the tendency to move in a straight line). Among these, the concept of vega closely resembles the modern understanding of inertia. While Galileo focused on the behavior of objects under frictionless conditions, emphasizing that an object continues in its state of motion unless acted upon by an external force, ancient Indian thinkers explained motion in terms of multiple forces interacting in different ways, including the atmospheric opposition. The principal difference lies in the systematic experimental approach of Galileo versus the more descriptive and qualitative approach of ancient Indian theories. However, both recognize an inherent property of matter that resists changes in motion.",
    "explanation": "The answer highlights that while the theoretical language and categorization of forces differ between the two traditions, a fundamental recognition of an object's tendency to maintain its state of motion or rest is common to both. Galileo’s approach is more quantitative and experimental, whereas ancient Indian science offers a broader, sometimes philosophical, categorization of forces.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The double inclined plane experiment is significant because it provides a practical demonstration of both energy conservation and inertia. When the ball is allowed to roll down from one inclined plane and up the other, nearly the same height is reached, illustrating that potential energy is effectively converted to kinetic energy and back, assuming minimal friction. Modifying the slope of the second plane, such as reducing it to a horizontal line, increases the distance over which the ball travels while maintaining the same energy, as there is no net force to stop the ball. This extended travel distance exemplifies how, in a frictionless environment, motion continues indefinitely due to inertia. The experiment thus not only confirms the principle of energy conservation in an ideal system but also reinforces that a body will not alter its state of motion in the absence of an external force.",
    "explanation": "This question requires integrating knowledge of energy transfer with the concept of inertia. The answer must address how the energy conversion process occurs on different inclinations and how the horizontal scenario represents a special case where the ball’s kinetic energy is sustained because of the absence of any decelerating forces.",
