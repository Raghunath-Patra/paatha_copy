    "correct_answer": "The center of mass continues along its original parabolic path because the explosion involves only internal forces, which do not affect the motion of the center of mass. The external force of gravity remains unchanged and continues to act on the system as a whole.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's second law applied to the center of mass of a system of particles states that the total mass of the system times the acceleration of the center of mass equals the sum of the external forces acting on the system. Internal forces do not contribute to this equation because they cancel each other out due to Newton's third law. By focusing only on external forces, one can analyze the motion of the center of mass independently from the complex internal interactions.",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins with the definition of the center of mass (M R = m1 r1 + m2 r2 + ... + mn rn) and differentiates it with respect to time to connect the velocity of the center of mass with the velocities of the individual particles (M V = m1 v1 + m2 v2 + ... + mn vn). A further differentiation gives the acceleration relation (M A = m1 a1 + m2 a2 + ... + mn an). By applying Newton's second law (F = m a) to each particle and summing, we form the equation M A = F1 + F2 + ... + Fn. Noting that the internal forces cancel out, we conclude that M A = F_ext. This result implies that the center of mass behaves as if the entire mass were concentrated at that point, with all external forces acting on it.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The motion of the objectâ€™s center of mass is determined solely by the net external forces acting on the system. By treating the entire mass of the object as if it were concentrated at the center of mass, one can apply Newtonâ€™s second law (F_ext = M A) without needing to account for the internal forces or rotational components. Internal motions and rotations contribute to the object's kinetic energy and angular momentum, but they do not affect the translational acceleration of the center of mass. This decoupling allows a clear and simplified analysis of translational motion irrespective of internal complexities.",
    "explanation": "This approach is particularly useful because it allows the analysis of the object's overall motion in a gravitational or other external field without getting entangled in the details of internal force distributions. The equation M A = F_ext provides a straightforward way to calculate the acceleration of the center of mass, while any rotational motion is handled separately through torque and moment of inertia considerations.",
