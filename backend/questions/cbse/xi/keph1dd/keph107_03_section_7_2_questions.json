This departure led to a more accurate description of planetary motions, accounting for the variations in orbital speeds and distances. The implication was a deeper understanding of gravitational forces and laid the groundwork for Newton's law of universal gravitation.",
    "explanation": "The Copernican model assumed circular orbits with uniform speed, which could not accurately predict planetary positions. Kepler's First Law introduced elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus, while his Second Law explained the variable speed as a natural consequence of angular momentum conservation. This paradigm shift ultimately improved the predictive power of astronomical models and contributed to the development of classical mechanics.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Using conservation of angular momentum, we have m · r_P · v_P = m · r_A · v_A, which implies that v_A = (r_P / r_A) · v_P. Since the planet moves slower at aphelion (where r_A is larger) and faster at perihelion, the areas swept out during equal time intervals are the same. However, the planet takes longer to traverse segments of its orbit where its speed is lower (e.g., between aphelion and the adjacent vertex) compared to segments near perihelion.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts from the conservation of angular momentum, setting m · r_P · v_P equal to m · r_A · v_A, leading to the relation v_A = (r_P/r_A) · v_P. This relationship shows that if r_A > r_P, then v_A < v_P.
