Since the particle moves along a circle of radius r, ds = r dθ. Considering the effective component of the force that does work is the tangential one, we have F_t = F sin α (or cos φ, with α and φ complementary). Thus, dW = F_t (r dθ).

    "correct_answer": "In rotational motion about a fixed axis, the torque component parallel to the axis is responsible for causing rotation, while the perpendicular component would tend to change the orientation of the axis. However, due to constraint forces that prevent the axis from moving, the perpendicular torque components are cancelled. Thus, when calculating the work done or the net effect of torques, only the component parallel to the fixed axis is considered. This ensures that analyses remain consistent with the physical reality of the rotating system.",
    "explanation": "The physical constraint of a fixed axis means that the system is designed so that any torque trying to upset the rotation by acting perpendicular to the axis is counterbalanced by constraint forces.

In rotational motion, a similar relationship exists where the work done by a torque is dW = τ dθ, leading to a change in rotational kinetic energy ΔK = ½ Iω².
