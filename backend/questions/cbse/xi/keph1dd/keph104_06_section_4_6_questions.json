    "correct_answer": "In the example, each billiard ball collides with a rigid wall and reverses its x-component of momentum while its y-component remains unchanged in the oblique collision. The impulse is determined by calculating the change in momentum, such as -2mu cos θ in the x-direction for the oblique case (with θ = 30°). The force on the ball is in the direction of the impulse, which is normal to the wall. Using Newton's third law, the wall experiences an equal and opposite force, also directed normal to the wall.",
    "explanation": "The solution involves first analyzing the momentum components before and after the collision. In a head-on collision, the impulse is simply -2mu; for an oblique collision, only the x-component of the momentum changes sign, giving an impulse of -2mu cos(θ). Newton's third law then tells us that the force exerted on the wall is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. This method illustrates the application of both the second and third laws.",

    "correct_answer": "Newton's third law implies that the stone and the Earth exert equal and opposite gravitational forces on each other.

    "explanation": "The analysis involves applying Newton's law of universal gravitation and Newton's third law. Even though the forces are equal, F = G(m1*m2)/r^2, the resulting accelerations are inversely proportional to the masses of the bodies.

    "correct_answer": "The misconception arises because the terms 'action' and 'reaction' suggest a sequential process, yet Newton's third law clarifies that both forces occur simultaneously. Examples include pressing a spring (where both the hand and spring experience forces at the same time) and gravitational interactions (where the force between two bodies is mutual and instantaneous). This simultaneous occurrence means that neither force causes the other; instead, they are inherent aspects of the interaction.",
    "explanation": "The answer must reference that labeling forces as action and reaction is a linguistic convenience. It emphasizes that both forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and occur at the same time.
