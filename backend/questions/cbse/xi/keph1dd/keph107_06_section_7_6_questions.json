According to Newton's shell theorem, the outer shell exerts no net force on a mass inside it. The inner sphere has mass M_s which, due to uniform density, relates to the total mass as M_s/M_E = (RE - d)³/RE³. For the mass outside the inner sphere, the gravitational force is as if all of M_s were at the center, giving F = GM_s m/(RE - d)². Substituting M_s = M_E (RE - d)³/RE³ into the force expression yields F = GM_E m (RE - d)/RE³.

    "explanation": "The variation of gravitational acceleration above and below the Earth's surface is governed by different geometric considerations. For h above the surface, the distance from the Earth's center increases to RE + h, and using the binomial expansion the decrease is approximated by g(1 - 2h/RE), showing a steeper decline. Below the surface, the effective mass contributing to the gravitational pull is only that within a sphere of radius (RE - d); hence, g(d) = g(1 - d/RE) shows a linear decrease with depth, in part because the outer spherical shells exert no net force inside. This difference in the factor (2 for height vs 1 for depth) arises from the inverse-square law in the former and the linear dependency on the volume (thus radius cubed) in the latter.",
