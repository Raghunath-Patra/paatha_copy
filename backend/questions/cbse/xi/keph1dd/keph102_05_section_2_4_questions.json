This concept simplifies calculations since it relates the total displacement to a uniform average velocity even though the instantaneous velocity is continuously changing.",
    "explanation": "By having constant acceleration, the rate of change of velocity is uniform.

Starting with the kinematic equation v^2 = v0^2 + 2 a x and setting the final velocity v = 0, we get 0 = v0^2 + 2 a x. Rearranging gives x = - (v0^2)/(2 a). Since a is a deceleration (negative value), the stopping distance is positive. This formula shows that the stopping distance increases with the square of the initial velocity, implying that higher speeds significantly increase the stopping distance and therefore are critical for road safety.",
    "explanation": "By setting the final velocity to zero in the kinematic equation, we derive the stopping distance formula x = - (v0^2)/(2 a).
