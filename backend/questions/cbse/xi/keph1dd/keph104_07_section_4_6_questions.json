    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's third law is crucial because it ensures that for every force exerted by the wall on the ball during the collision, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the ball on the wall. This mutual force exchange leads to the concept of impulse, which is the change in momentum of the ball. In the collision, although the speed remains unchanged, the direction of the horizontal component of velocity reverses, causing a net change in momentum. This change, computed as twice the product of mass and the horizontal velocity component, is directly responsible for the average force experienced during the brief contact time. The law thereby explains both the dynamic interaction between the ball and the wall and the means by which momentum is conserved within the system.",
    "explanation": "The explanation involves applying both Newton's second and third laws: the force on the ball causes a change in momentum (impulse), while Newton's third law guarantees that the wall experiences an equal and opposite impulse. The collision example reinforces the idea that forces are not isolated and that action-reaction pairs play a fundamental role in momentum conservation during impacts.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The misconception arises from everyday experience where responses seem delayed; however, in the framework of Newton's third law, action and reaction forces occur simultaneously because they are inherent to the interaction between two bodies. There is no temporal sequence in the manifestation of these forces. For example, when a ball strikes a wall, the force exerted on the ball by the wall and the equal and opposite force exerted by the ball on the wall occur at the same moment. This simultaneous action ensures momentum is conserved instantly within the system and demonstrates that neither force is the cause or effect of the other.",
    "explanation": "Newton's third law explicitly states that forces come in pairs and act at the same time, thereby eliminating any notion of a time lag between action and reaction. The idea that one force causes the other is a misinterpretation; instead, they are coexisting and interdependent, ensuring mutual influence between the interacting bodies. This has been confirmed by numerous experiments and is a foundational concept in mechanics.",
