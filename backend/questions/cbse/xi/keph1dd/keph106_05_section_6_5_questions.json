Rotate the screw from the direction of a to that of b through the smaller angle (less than 180°). The direction in which the screw's tip moves is the direction of a x b. This ensures that the correct perpendicular direction is chosen, avoiding ambiguity from the two possible angles between a and b.",

The thumb then points in the direction of the cross product. The rule emphasizes that the rotation should be through the smaller angle (less than 180°) to resolve the two possible orientations.
