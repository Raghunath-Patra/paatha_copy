    "correct_answer": "By assuming that the time period T depends on the length l, gravitational acceleration g, and possibly the mass m, one writes T = k * l^x * g^y * m^z. Recognizing that mass does not affect the period leads to z = 0. Equate dimensions: T has [T], l has [L], and g has [L T^-2]. This gives T = k * [L]^x * ([L T^-2])^y = [L]^(x+y) * [T]^(-2y). Setting up the equations for the exponents: (x + y) = 0 and -2y = 1 leads to y = -1/2 and x = 1/2. Therefore, T is proportional to sqrt(l/g), with k determined experimentally.",
    "explanation": "The process involves assuming the form of dependency with unknown exponents, expressing the dimensions of each variable, and equating the exponents for each fundamental dimension. Since the mass does not affect the period, its exponent is zero.

As such, it fails to provide complete information in cases where underlying physics, non-dimensionless factors, or complex interactions are involved.",
    "explanation": "Dimensional analysis only verifies that the units on both sides of an equation are consistent. It doesn't determine the magnitude of dimensionless constants (such as 2π in the pendulum formula) and cannot distinguish between equations that are dimensionally similar but physically different.

An inconsistent expression might be written as a = F/m + v, where v is velocity ([L T^-1]). The addition of v to F/m is invalid because the dimensions do not match: [L T^-2] vs. [L T^-1]. This inconsistency violates the principle of homogeneity of dimensions.",
    "explanation": "In a correct physical formula, every term must share the same dimensions. The expression a = F/m is dimensionally consistent because it yields acceleration with dimensions [L T^-2]. However, the expression a = F/m + v adds a velocity term (dimensions [L T^-1]) to force per unit mass (dimensions [L T^-2]), which is not allowable.
