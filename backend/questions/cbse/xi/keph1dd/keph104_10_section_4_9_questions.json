Unlike universal laws that have a solid theoretical foundation, friction laws are approximations valid under typical conditions and do not account for complex microscale interactions such as surface roughness, material deformation, or temperature effects. Their limitations include the lack of precise predictions in non-ideal conditions and dependency on the specific surfaces in contact.",
