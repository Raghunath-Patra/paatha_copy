This is done by adding the force due to gravity (mass times gravitational acceleration) and the frictional force. Once the total force is identified, multiply it by the constant speed of the elevator to find the power given by the equation: Power = Total Force × Speed.",
    "explanation": "This explanation outlines the step-by-step process: first, compute gravitational force (m × g), then add the frictional force so that the total force is m × g + friction.

    "correct_answer": "Power ratings in appliances indicate the rate at which they consume energy. A higher power rating means the device uses more energy per unit time. For example, a 100-watt bulb consumes 100 joules per second, and if operated over an hour, will use 100 watt-hours of energy. For refrigerators, a lower power rating may indicate more energy efficient operation over long periods. Energy consumption is thus directly linked to these ratings, and understanding them helps in managing energy bills and evaluating appliance efficiency.",
    "explanation": "This response addresses the importance of power ratings by discussing how power relates to energy consumption over time. Specific examples of a 100-watt bulb and an energy-efficient refrigerator are provided to illustrate the point.
