    "correct_answer": "The moment of inertia depends on the distribution of mass relative to the chosen axis. Shifting the axis alters the distances of the mass elements from the axis, thereby changing I. For instance, a thin rod has I = M L²/12 when rotated about its midpoint, but I increases if the axis is moved closer to one end. Similarly, for a circular disc, the moment of inertia is lower when rotated about an axis through the center compared to an axis along the edge.",
    "explanation": "The moment of inertia is calculated by integrating mass elements times the square of their perpendicular distances from the rotation axis. Changing the axis alters these distances. This is clearly seen in the given examples: the rod’s I increases as the distances from the new axis become larger, and for a disc, the central axis minimizes these distances compared to an off-center axis. The key principle is the dependency of I on how mass is distributed relative to the rotation axis.",

    "correct_answer": "One can design an experiment involving a flywheel with adjustable mass distribution. By adding weights at different radii and measuring the angular acceleration when a constant torque is applied, one observes that increased moment of inertia (weights placed further from the center) results in slower acceleration. The procedure involves measuring the acceleration for various configurations, analyzing the data using the relation τ = I α, and verifying that I increases with the square of the distance of the weights from the axis.",
    "explanation": "The experiment should include a flywheel mounted on a low-friction axle. Weights are added at varying distances from the center to modify the moment of inertia. A constant torque is applied using a known force and lever arm. By measuring the angular acceleration in each configuration and using the equation τ = I α, one can compute I. Observations will confirm that increasing the radius at which the mass is placed increases I, thereby demonstrating how moment of inertia resists changes in rotational motion.",
