    "correct_answer": "The limiting process entails taking the average velocity or acceleration over a time interval Δt and then letting Δt approach zero. For instantaneous velocity, this means v = lim (Δt→0)(Δr/Δt) = dr/dt. As Δt becomes very small, the displacement vector Δr becomes tangent to the path at that instant, dictating that the instantaneous velocity points along the tangent. Similarly, instantaneous acceleration is defined as a = lim (Δt→0)(Δv/Δt) = dv/dt, which shows how the velocity vector changes over an infinitesimally small time period. Graphical representations typically show successive secant lines approaching the tangent as Δt decreases.",

In contrast, for motion in two-dimensional space, the velocity and acceleration vectors can have any angle between 0° and 180° relative to each other. This is due to the fact that in two dimensions, the acceleration can have components that change the magnitude of the velocity as well as its direction, causing the acceleration vector to differ from the velocity vector in direction.",
    "explanation": "This difference stems from the additional degree of freedom in two-dimensional motion. While one-dimensional motion restricts movement to a line, making the direction of change (acceleration) necessarily align with or oppose the motion, two-dimensional motion allows for changes in trajectory which result in velocity and acceleration vectors that can be non-collinear.",
