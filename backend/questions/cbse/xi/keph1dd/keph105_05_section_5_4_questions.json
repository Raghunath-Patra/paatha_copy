    "correct_answer": "Kinetic energy in natural phenomena is harnessed by converting the energy of moving fluids into useful work. For example, the wind imparts kinetic energy to the sails of a ship, pushing it forward, while a flowing stream can drive mills to grind corn. In both cases, the energy of motion is transformed, using mechanical devices (sails or water wheels) that convert kinetic energy into a form of work that accomplishes practical tasks.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that moving air or water bodies carry kinetic energy which, when intercepted by mechanical systems, is converted into work (e.g., propulsion of ships or grinding of corn).

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The classical kinetic energy formula assumes that speeds are much less than the speed of light and that relativistic effects are negligible. At very high speeds, corrections from Einstein's theory of relativity become significant, because the increase in mass and the effects of time dilation mean that the simple 1/2 m v^2 equation no longer accurately represents the kinetic energy. Therefore, while the classical formula works well at everyday speeds, for speeds approaching that of light, the relativistic kinetic energy formula must be used.",
    "explanation": "This answer indicates that the classical formula is an approximation valid for non-relativistic speeds. When speeds get close to the speed of light, relativistic effects cannot be ignored, and more complex equations are required to accurately calculate kinetic energy.",

Step 3: Using KE_final = 1/2 m v_final^2, solve for v_final: 250 = 0.5 x 0.04 x v_final^2, so v_final^2 = 250 / (0.02) = 12500, hence v_final = sqrt(12500) ≈ 111.8 m/s.",
