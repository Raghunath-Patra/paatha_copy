It simplifies problems by focusing on energy changes without needing the detailed time evolution of the force.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The work-energy theorem is fundamentally an energy balance expressed in scalar form, which means that when dealing with two or three dimensional motion, it does not capture directional details that are integral to vector dynamics. Newton's second law, expressed in vector form, accounts for the individual components of force and acceleration. As a result, while the work-energy theorem can be used to determine changes in the energy state of a system, it does not provide information about the direction of motion or resolve forces into components. This limitation can restrict its use in complex systems where directional forces (such as friction, drag, or magnetic forces) are critical for understanding the complete dynamics.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that the scalar nature of the work-energy theorem limits its ability to describe vectorial aspects of motion.

    "correct_answer": "The procedure starts by writing the kinetic energy as (1/2) m v^2. The next step is to differentiate kinetic energy with respect to time to obtain dK/dt = m v (dv/dt) and then substitute F = m (dv/dt) from Newton's second law to get dK/dt = Fv. Recognizing that v = dx/dt, this expression transforms into dK = F dx. Integrating both sides from the initial to final positions, the result is Kf - Ki = ∫(xi to xf) F dx. The boundary conditions are set by knowing the initial kinetic energy Ki and the displacement limits (xi and xf) over which the force is applied. Assumptions may include the constancy of mass and the one-dimensional nature of the problem, as well as that the force function F(x) is known and integrable over the interval.",
