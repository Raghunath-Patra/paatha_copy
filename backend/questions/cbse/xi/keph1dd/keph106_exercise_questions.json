    "correct_answer": "For a uniform sphere, cylinder, ring, and cube, the centre of mass is located at their geometric centre. However, the centre of mass does not necessarily lie inside the body if the mass distribution is non‐convex or irregular.",
    "explanation": "Uniform, symmetric shapes have their mass evenly distributed so that the mass‐weighted average of positions (i.e. the centre of mass) coincides with the geometric centre. In contrast, if a body is non‑convex or its mass distribution is irregular, the centre of mass can lie outside the actual material boundaries.",
