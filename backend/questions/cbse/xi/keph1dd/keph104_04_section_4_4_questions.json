    "correct_answer": "Friction between the tires and the road provides the necessary net external force to accelerate the car. While internal forces such as those from the engine convert chemical energy to mechanical energy, only the frictional force can act externally at the point of contact between the car and the road. Without this friction, the car's wheels would spin in place and the car would not accelerate.",
    "explanation": "The car's acceleration is a direct demonstration of Newton's First Law. Internal forces, despite being responsible for energy conversion, do not change the overall momentum of the car. It is the frictional force that ensures that momentum change takes place, thereby resulting in acceleration. This is a clear example of applying Newton's First Law where the net external force (provided by friction) is responsible for the acceleration.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the bus accelerates suddenly, the person's feet experience the frictional force with the bus floor and are accelerated along with the bus. However, due to inertia, the rest of the body tends to remain in its original state of rest, leading to a relative backward displacement. As the body adjusts, internal muscular forces eventually bring the body to move forward with the bus. This interplay of inertia and friction explains why passengers feel a jerk when the bus starts or stops abruptly.",
    "explanation": "This detailed analysis shows that while friction is the external force that initially moves the feet with the bus, inertia causes the rest of the body to lag. The observed backward jerk is a direct consequence of the body's resistance to change its state of motion (inertia). Newton's First Law underpins this behavior, as the net external force (from friction) first affects only the parts in direct contact, while the remaining parts follow after internal forces adjust the motion.",
