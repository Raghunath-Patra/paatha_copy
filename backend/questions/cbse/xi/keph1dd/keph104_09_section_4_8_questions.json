    "correct_answer": "Applying the horizontal force results in the tension force in the rope being resolved into horizontal and vertical components, where the horizontal component must balance the applied force, and the vertical component balances the weight of the mass. This causes the rope to make a specific angle with the vertical, determined by the ratio of the applied force to the weight.",
    "explanation": "In the given problem, the weight of the mass is balanced by the vertical component of the tension in the rope (T1 cos theta = weight), while the horizontal component (T1 sin theta) balances the applied horizontal force. By dividing the horizontal component equation by the vertical one, we obtain tan theta = (horizontal force)/(weight).
