      "A collision in which the colliding bodies stick together.",
      "A collision in which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.",
      "A collision in which momentum is not conserved.",
      "A collision that transforms all kinetic energy into heat and sound."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A collision in which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.",
    "explanation": "In an elastic collision, by definition, not only is momentum conserved, but kinetic energy is also conserved. This distinguishes it from inelastic collisions where some kinetic energy is lost.",
