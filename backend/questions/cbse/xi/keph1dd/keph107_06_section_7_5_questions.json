For a point at a distance r from the center, the shells with radius greater than r exert no net force on the mass due to the shell theorem.

By calculating the mass M_r within this sphere (M_r = (4/3) π r^3 ρ) and applying Newton's law of gravitation, the force is F = G m M_r / r^2, which simplifies to F = G m ME r / RE^3 when uniform density is assumed.",

    "correct_answer": "Assuming uniform density simplifies the calculations by allowing the use of the formula ME = (4/3) π RE^3 ρ and M_r = (4/3) π r^3 ρ. However, in reality the Earth has a layered structure with varying densities (e.g., crust, mantle, core).

It affects the accuracy of derived results such as the force experienced at different depths and the estimation of mass distribution within the Earth.",

However, it neglects the complex structure of the Earth, which includes variations in composition and density with depth.
