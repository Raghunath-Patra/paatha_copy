    "correct_answer": "Pure translational motion is characterized by all particles of the body moving with the same velocity, such as a block sliding down an incline. In combined translational and rotational motion, the body both translates and rotates; for instance, a rolling cylinder has a centre of mass that translates, while also rotating about its axis resulting in varying velocities at different points.",
    "explanation": "In pure translation (e.g., a sliding block), every point in the body follows the same linear trajectory and has the same speed. In contrast, during combined motion (e.g., a rolling cylinder), while the centre of mass follows a straight-line or curved path, the rotation causes points at different radial distances to have different speeds (v = ωr).

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A rolling cylinder down an inclined plane exhibits both translational motion, as its centre of mass moves down the slope, and rotational motion about its axis. The condition for rolling without slipping requires that the velocity of the centre of mass equals the product of the angular velocity and the radius (v = ωr) so that the point of contact with the plane is momentarily at rest.",
    "explanation": "When a cylinder rolls without slipping, every point on the cylinder experiences a combination of linear translation and rotation. The centre of mass moves steadily down the incline, while each point on the cylinder follows a circular path relative to the axis. The no-slipping condition (v = ωr) ensures that there is no relative motion at the point of contact. This integration of translation and rotation is key to understanding energy distribution and dynamics in rolling motion.",

    "correct_answer": "Defining the centre of mass allows us to treat an extended body as if all its mass were concentrated at a single point. This simplifies the analysis by reducing the complexity of dealing with multiple interacting particles to a single point mass, making it easier to apply Newton’s laws of motion and predict the behaviour of the body under various forces.",
    "explanation": "Using the centre of mass concept, complex rotational and translational motions of extended bodies can be decomposed and analyzed separately. The centre of mass follows a trajectory determined solely by external forces, independent of the internal structure. This simplification is fundamental in mechanics, enabling accurate modelling of systems ranging from rolling objects to celestial bodies.",
