    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The principle of conservation of linear momentum states that if no external forces act on a system, its total momentum remains constant. In a radioactive decay process, even though the individual decay fragments (such as the radon nucleus and the alpha particle) are subject to large internal forces, their vector sum of momenta must equal the original momentum of the radium nucleus. This means that if the radium nucleus was moving before decay, the center-of-mass of the resulting system will continue in the same direction at the same speed.",
    "explanation": "During radioactive decay, all forces involved are internal. Conservation of momentum dictates that the momentum before decay equals the momentum after decay. Therefore, regardless of the directions of the radon nucleus and the alpha particle after splitting, the vector sum of their momenta is equal to the initial momentum of the radium nucleus. This ensures the center-of-mass continues to move uniformly, highlighting the effectiveness of analyzing such events in both the laboratory and center-of-mass frames.",

    "correct_answer": "Separating the total motion into the motion of the center of mass and the motion about the center of mass simplifies analysis by decoupling the global translation of the system from the internal interactions. This approach reduces a complex, many-body problem into two parts: one that describes the overall movement (governed by the net external force) and another that focuses on the relative motion of the particles (described by internal forces).",
    "explanation": "When external forces are absent or negligible, the center-of-mass motion is uniform and can be treated as a simple free particle motion. The remaining complex trajectories due to internal forces are then analyzed relative to the center of mass. This separation greatly facilitates the understanding and solving of problems like collisions, decays, or orbital motions in astrophysical systems.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the laboratory frame, a binary star system appears to have a complex motion that is a combination of the uniform motion of the center of mass and the individual orbital motions of the stars. In the center-of-mass frame, however, the center of mass is at rest, and each star follows a simple circular (or elliptical, depending on the scenario) trajectory around this fixed point. This comparison highlights how the center-of-mass frame can simplify the understanding of orbital dynamics.",
    "explanation": "In the lab frame, the overall motion includes both the linear translation of the center of mass and the individual orbital paths of the stars. Switching to the center-of-mass frame removes the translational component, showing that the stars orbit with respect to a fixed point. This frame makes it easier to apply classical mechanics principles, as the conservation laws become more straightforward to use in analysing the internal dynamics.",
