    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The derivation begins by considering the total angular momentum L of a rigid body as the sum of the individual angular momenta of all particles, expressed as L = Σ(r × p). For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, one can separate the angular momentum into a component along the axis (Lz) and a perpendicular component (L⊥). For symmetric bodies, L⊥ cancels out due to pairs of particles contributing oppositely. Taking the time derivative of Lz gives dLz/dt = d(Iω)/dt. Assuming the moment of inertia I remains constant (i.e., the body’s shape and mass distribution do not change), the derivative reduces to I(dω/dt) = Iα, where α is the angular acceleration. This rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the net external torque τ acting about the fixed axis. Thus, τ = Iα. Assumptions include constant I and that only the z-component of torque contributes to the change in L for rotation about a fixed axis.",
    "explanation": "The explanation involves the vector summation of angular momentum and the use of the work-energy principle. The approach assumes symmetry in the body so that only the component along the axis survives, and a constant moment of inertia simplifies the derivative to yield τ = Iα.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a person on a swivel chair extends their arms, their moment of inertia increases because the mass is distributed further from the center of rotation. Since no external torque acts on the system, angular momentum (L = Iω) must be conserved. To maintain constant L, an increase in I results in a decrease in angular velocity ω. Conversely, when the arms are retracted, I decreases and ω increases. This is a practical demonstration of the conservation of angular momentum, where internal reconfiguration of mass leads to a change in rotation rate.",
    "explanation": "This phenomenon is observed in many activities like ice skating spins and acrobatics. The explanation uses the fundamental equation L = Iω, and since L is constant in the absence of external torque, any change in I necessitates an inverse change in ω.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a symmetric rigid body, for every particle with a given velocity and position, there exists another particle diametrically opposite with an equal and opposite velocity component. This results in the cancellation of the perpendicular components (L⊥) of angular momentum so that only the component along the fixed axis (Lz) contributes to the net angular momentum (L = Iω). In a non-symmetric body, this cancellation is incomplete because the distribution of mass is uneven; thus, L⊥ does not vanish. As a result, the total angular momentum vector L is not aligned with the axis of rotation but is tilted, incorporating contributions from both the perpendicular and axial components.",
    "explanation": "The answer details how symmetry ensures that off-axis contributions cancel out, and explains that an uneven mass distribution results in a net L⊥, affecting the overall direction of L.
