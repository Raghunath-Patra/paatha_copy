    "explanation": "In physics, every derived unit can be broken down into the base quantities. Volume is the product of three lengths, making its dimensional formula [L^3].

For example, in the equation for force, F = m × a, mass has dimensions [M] and acceleration has dimensions [L T^-2]; thus, force has dimensions [M L T^-2]. If any equation results in differing dimensions on either side, it indicates an error in the formulation.",
    "explanation": "The technique of dimensional analysis involves comparing the dimensions on both sides of a physical equation. If the dimensions do not match, the equation is likely incorrect.
