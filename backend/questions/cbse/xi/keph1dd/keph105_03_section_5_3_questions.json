    "correct_answer": "In everyday language, 'work' generally refers to any effort or task undertaken, which may not necessarily involve physical movement or energy transfer. In physics, however, work is strictly defined as the product of a force component along the direction of displacement and the magnitude of that displacement. For example, when you push against a brick wall, you may feel tired (indicating you are expending energy), but since the wall does not move, no work is done in the physics sense. On the other hand, when a cyclist skids to a stop due to friction, the frictional force does negative work because it acts opposite to the direction of motion, resulting in a loss of kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "This answer highlights the difference between the colloquial meaning of work (involving effort) and the precise physics definition which depends on both force and displacement. It emphasizes that without displacement, no work is done, irrespective of the force applied.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, meaning the force the road exerts on the cycle is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force the cycle exerts on the road. However, work is defined as the product of the force and the displacement in the direction of that force. In Example 5.3, while the road applies a 200 N force over a displacement of 10 m (resulting in -2000 J of work because the force opposes the displacement), the cycle does not move the road at all; hence, the displacement is zero and the work done by the cycle on the road is 0 J. This discrepancy shows that equal and opposite forces do not necessarily result in equal and opposite work.",
    "explanation": "The explanation clearly connects Newton's Third Law with the work formula. It shows that the work depends not only on the force but also on the displacement, and if one object does not move, it performs no work, even if the force involved is equal and opposite.",
