    "explanation": "Starting from the definition, force is calculated by multiplying mass (with dimension [M]) by acceleration (with dimension [L]/[T^2]).

    "correct_answer": "Base quantities such as length [L], mass [M], and time [T] are the foundational building blocks for all derived quantities in mechanics. For example, volume is derived by multiplying three lengths, resulting in [L^3]. Velocity is determined as displacement per unit time, giving [L]/[T]. Force is calculated as mass times acceleration, with acceleration being length per time squared, resulting in [M L T^-2].",
    "explanation": "In mechanics, the base quantities are sufficient to describe any physical quantity. Volume uses three factors of length ([L^3]); velocity involves length and time ([L T^-1]); force combines mass and acceleration ([M] for mass and [L T^-2] for acceleration) to form [M L T^-2]. This method of combining base units demonstrates the systematic approach in dimensional analysis that helps in checking the consistency of equations and deriving relationships between physical variables.",
