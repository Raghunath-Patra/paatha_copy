Instead, the displacement is divided into infinitesimally small segments over which the force is nearly constant. The work for each segment is F(x)*dx and summing these works gives the integral W = ∫ from x_i to x_f F(x) dx. The integral yields an exact value because as the intervals become infinitesimally small, the approximation becomes precise, accounting accurately for the variation in force.",
