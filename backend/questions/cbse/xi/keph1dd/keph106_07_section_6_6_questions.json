Angular velocity thus serves as the key variable in distinguishing between the two, as it captures the rate of rotation which is the same for all particles in a rigid body undergoing rotation.",
    "explanation": "Pure translation implies a shift in the position where every point in the body moves identically, while in pure rotation, although different points have different linear speeds, they all share the same angular velocity.

    "correct_answer": "The equation v = ω x r is derived by considering the motion of a particle in a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis. The position vector r is drawn from a point on the axis to the particle, and the angular velocity ω, which is oriented along the axis, defines the rate of rotation. Taking the cross product of ω and r results in a vector that is perpendicular to both; this is aligned with the tangent to the circular path. The magnitude of this cross product gives ωr, which is the linear speed of the particle, thus linking angular and linear kinematics.",
    "explanation": "The derivation involves recognizing that while the angular displacement dθ over time dt gives ω as dθ/dt, the linear displacement is along the tangent of the circle. Using the cross product (ω x r) naturally incorporates both the magnitude (ωr when r is perpendicular to ω) and the direction (tangent to the circle), thereby providing a complete description of the particle's velocity in rotational motion.",
