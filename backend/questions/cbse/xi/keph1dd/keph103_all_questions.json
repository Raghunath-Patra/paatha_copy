    "correct_answer": "The displacement vector is significant because it provides a clear measure of the change in position of an object by directly connecting the initial and final positions, regardless of the path taken. It represents the net effect of movement and is essential in determining resultant movements, velocities, and accelerations. Unlike the actual path traveled, which may be long and curved, the displacement vector is concerned only with the shortest distance between two points, simplifying calculations in mechanics.",
    "explanation": "By focusing on the net change in position, the displacement vector allows us to analyze motions without getting bogged down by the complexities of the path taken.

For example, consider vector A pointing east with a magnitude of 5 units and vector B also of 5 units but pointing north.

    "explanation": "Using the parallelogram method, the magnitude of the resultant is given by R = sqrt((25)² + (10)² + 2*25*10*cos 120°). Since cos 120° = -0.5, we have R = sqrt(625 + 100 - 250) = sqrt(475) ≈ 21.8 km/h, which rounds to about 22 km/h. The angle is calculated using the Law of Sines: sin φ = (10*sin120°) / R.

    "correct_answer": "The derivation begins by considering an object moving along a circle with constant speed v. Since velocity is a vector, its direction changes continuously as the object progresses along the circle. By taking two closely spaced points on the circle, the change in velocity Δv can be determined using vector addition, forming a triangle that is similar to the triangle formed by the change in the position vectors. Recognizing that the arc length Δs is approximately equal to vΔt for small intervals and using similar triangles, one obtains the ratio |Δv|/v = |Δr|/R. As Δt approaches zero, |Δr|/Δt becomes v, which leads to the formula a = lim(Δt→0) |Δv|/Δt = v²/R. This derivation shows that although the magnitude of acceleration is constant, its direction always points toward the centre of the circle.",
    "explanation": "The derivation uses geometric arguments by comparing the triangles formed by the vectors and linking the small angle approximation where arc length is given by vΔt. The similarity of triangles leads directly to the relationship between the changes in velocity and position vectors.

The centripetal acceleration is given by a_c = v²/R, which can also be written in terms of angular speed as a_c = (R × ω)²/R = R × ω². For example, consider an object moving in a circle of radius R = 4 m with an angular speed ω = 2 rad/s. The linear speed is v = 4 m × 2 rad/s = 8 m/s, and the centripetal acceleration is a_c = 8²/4 = 64/4 = 16 m/s² or, using a_c = 4 × (2²) = 16 m/s².

This method is illustrated in Fig. 3.8.",

At two nearby positions P and P' separated by a small angle Δθ, the velocity vectors v and v' are tangent to the circle. Since the magnitude of velocity remains constant, the change in velocity Δv is due to the change in direction. By constructing a vector triangle with Δv, and using similar triangles formed by the position vectors, we find that |Δv|/v = |Δr|/R, where |Δr| is the arc length approximated by vΔt. Taking the limit as Δt approaches zero leads to a_c = lim(Δt→0)(|Δv|/Δt) = v²/R. This derivation shows that the acceleration is always directed towards the center of the circle.",
