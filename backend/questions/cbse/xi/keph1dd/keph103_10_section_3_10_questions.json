    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The derivation begins by considering an object moving along a circle with constant speed v. Since velocity is a vector, its direction changes continuously as the object progresses along the circle. By taking two closely spaced points on the circle, the change in velocity Δv can be determined using vector addition, forming a triangle that is similar to the triangle formed by the change in the position vectors. Recognizing that the arc length Δs is approximately equal to vΔt for small intervals and using similar triangles, one obtains the ratio |Δv|/v = |Δr|/R. As Δt approaches zero, |Δr|/Δt becomes v, which leads to the formula a = lim(Δt→0) |Δv|/Δt = v²/R. This derivation shows that although the magnitude of acceleration is constant, its direction always points toward the centre of the circle.",
    "explanation": "The derivation uses geometric arguments by comparing the triangles formed by the vectors and linking the small angle approximation where arc length is given by vΔt. The similarity of triangles leads directly to the relationship between the changes in velocity and position vectors. Finally, the limit as Δt approaches zero gives the instantaneous centripetal acceleration as v²/R.",

    "correct_answer": "Linear speed (v), angular speed (ω), and centripetal acceleration (a_c) are intimately related. The linear speed is given by the product of the radius and the angular speed, v = R × ω. The centripetal acceleration is given by a_c = v²/R, which can also be written in terms of angular speed as a_c = (R × ω)²/R = R × ω². For example, consider an object moving in a circle of radius R = 4 m with an angular speed ω = 2 rad/s. The linear speed is v = 4 m × 2 rad/s = 8 m/s, and the centripetal acceleration is a_c = 8²/4 = 64/4 = 16 m/s² or, using a_c = 4 × (2²) = 16 m/s². This example illustrates how the three quantities are mathematically connected.",
