    "correct_answer": "Static friction is directly proportional to the normal force, as given by fs_max = µs × N. On an inclined plane, the block begins to slide when the component of gravitational force parallel to the plane equals the maximum static friction. This gives mg sinθ = µs mg cosθ, leading to µs = tanθ. Experimentally, by slowly increasing the angle of an inclined plane until the block just begins to move, one can measure the critical angle θ and hence determine µs by calculating tanθ.",
    "explanation": "The relationship fs_max = µs × N shows that static friction is proportional to the normal force N. On an inclined plane, weight mg is resolved into mg cosθ (normal to the plane) and mg sinθ (parallel to the plane). Setting mg sinθ = µs mg cosθ and simplifying gives µs = tanθ.

    "correct_answer": "Static friction is essential in everyday applications such as walking or driving, where it prevents slipping and allows force transmission. Kinetic friction, while it causes energy loss in the form of heat in moving parts and brakes, is useful in stopping vehicles. Rolling friction, which is significantly lower than sliding friction, is exploited in the design of wheels, ball bearings, and air cushions to reduce energy loss in machines. Thus, friction is beneficial when it aids in controlled motion and adhesion, but detrimental when it causes unwanted energy dissipation.",
    "explanation": "Static friction prevents slipping, allowing safe movement (e.g., a car accelerating or a person walking). Kinetic friction, although causing wear and energy loss, is important in braking systems. Rolling friction, being low, makes the use of wheels and ball bearings efficient by minimizing energy loss during motion. These examples illustrate the dual nature of friction as both an enabler of motion and a source of resistance.",
