This shows that the total mechanical energy remains constant.",

    "correct_answer": "Conservative forces, such as gravity, have the property that the work done depends only on initial and final positions, allowing for potential energy to be defined. This means energy is stored and can be completely recovered as kinetic energy. Nonconservative forces, like friction, depend on the path taken, dissipate energy (usually as heat), and do not allow perfect energy storage. For example, on a frictionless incline, the gravitational potential energy converts fully into kinetic energy, whereas with friction some energy is lost.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines that conservative forces (e.g., gravity) lead to reversible energy transformations, as their work is path independent.
