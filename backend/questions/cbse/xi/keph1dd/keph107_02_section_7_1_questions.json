    "correct_answer": "Galileo's work was crucial in paving the way for the universal law of gravitation. By using inclined plane experiments to slow down the motion of falling objects, he demonstrated that the acceleration due to gravity is constant for all bodies, irrespective of mass. This empirical evidence challenged the Aristotelian notion that heavier objects fall faster and laid the experimental foundation for Newton's formulation of gravitational theory. His approach demonstrated the effectiveness of systematic experimentation and observational accuracy, marking a significant shift in scientific methodology.",
