    "explanation": "Each dimensional formula is based on the underlying physical concept. For example, force is derived using Newtonâ€™s second law: F = m a. Since mass (m) has a dimension M and acceleration (a) is distance per time squared (L T^-2), the force F has dimensions M L T^-2. Similarly, volume is the product of three lengths, resulting in L^3.
