    "correct_answer": "To analyze the equilibrium of a particle under three forces, first draw a free-body diagram showing all forces acting on the particle. Resolve each force into its components along mutually perpendicular directions (typically along x and y axes).

Finally, verify the solution by checking that the vector sum of the forces indeed equals zero.",

Force resolution into components allows separate balancing along axes, and forming equations ensures adherence to the equilibrium condition (F1 + F2 + F3 = 0).

    "correct_answer": "Translational equilibrium refers to the state where the net external force acting on a body is zero, ensuring no linear acceleration. Rotational equilibrium, however, means that the net external torque acting on the body is zero, preventing angular acceleration. Both concepts are crucial because a body may have zero net force but still experience rotation if the torques are unbalanced. In mechanics, ensuring both translational and rotational equilibrium is essential for complete stability, which is why free-body diagrams often analyze both forces and torques.",

Measurements would include force magnitudes and angles. The analysis would involve calculating the vector sums of the force components to verify that they add to zero, thus confirming equilibrium.
