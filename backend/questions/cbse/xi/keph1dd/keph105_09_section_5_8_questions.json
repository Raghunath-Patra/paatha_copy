    "correct_answer": "During free fall, as a ball is dropped from a height H, its gravitational potential energy (mgH) is converted into kinetic energy (½mv²) as it accelerates toward the ground. At the beginning, when the ball is at height H, its kinetic energy is zero and its potential energy is maximum. As the ball falls, potential energy decreases while kinetic energy increases such that the sum remains constant (mgH = ½mv² + mg(h)). This conversion can be illustrated in a diagram where the ball's energy state is shown at height H, an intermediate height h, and just before impact at the ground. The conservation of mechanical energy principle ensures that any loss in potential energy will be exactly balanced by an equivalent gain in kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "The explanation comes from the energy conservation formula: initial potential energy equals the sum of kinetic and potential energies at any subsequent point (mgH = ½mv² + mgh).

    "correct_answer": "The conservation of mechanical energy is a powerful tool because it allows one to relate the kinetic and potential energies at different positions without explicitly solving the equations of motion. In gravitational systems, it helps determine velocities at different heights (e.g., free fall problems) and in spring systems it aids in computing maximum displacements and speeds when potential energy of the spring is converted into kinetic energy. This principle simplifies problem solving by reducing the complexity of integrating force over distance.",
