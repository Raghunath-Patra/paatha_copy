This makes it possible to combine the effects in different directions to describe motion in two or three dimensions.",
    "explanation": "The extension from one-dimensional to multi-dimensional motion relies on the ability to treat vectors as entities with both magnitude and direction. By resolving vectors into components (e.g., x, y, and possibly z), one can apply the familiar one-dimensional motion equations to each component independently.

However, when motion occurs in a plane or in space, more than two directions are possible.
