    "correct_answer": "An artificial satellite in low Earth orbit operates at an altitude where h is negligible compared to RE, leading to a high orbital speed (approximately 7.5-8 km/s) and a short orbital period (about 85 minutes). In contrast, the Moon orbits at a large distance of about 3.84×10^8 m with a much lower orbital speed and an orbital period of approximately 27.3 days. In both cases, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force, but the magnitude of the force and the corresponding orbital characteristics differ markedly due to the differences in (RE + h) and the resulting speed from V^2 = (G M)/ (RE + h).",
    "explanation": "The comparison highlights the dependence of orbital characteristics on altitude.
