For example, a farmer ploughing a field is said to be working in everyday terms, but quantitatively, the work done is calculated by the force applied and the displacement achieved.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The cosine term in the scalar product, A dot B = A × B × cosθ, quantifies how much of one vector lies in the direction of the other. When the angle between the vectors is small, cosθ is close to 1, meaning the vectors are nearly parallel and the product is large; when the angle is 90°, cosθ is zero, so there is no projection; and when the angle is greater than 90°, the cosine is negative, indicating that the projection is in the opposite direction.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains that cosine serves as a measure of alignment between two vectors. This determines the effective component of one vector in the direction of the other. Different angles lead to various magnitudes of this projection: maximum when parallel, zero at right angles, and negative when vectors point in opposite directions.",
