When taking moments about any point O, the total moment is computed as r1 x (-F) + r2 x F, which simplifies to (r2 - r1) x F. Since r2 - r1 is the vector connecting the points of application of the forces, the result depends only on this separation and the force magnitude, and not on the choice of origin. Thus, the moment remains invariant regardless of the point chosen.",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins by writing the moments of the two forces about an arbitrary point O as: Moment = r1 x (-F) + r2 x F. Factoring the expression gives: Moment = (r2 - r1) x F.

The mechanical advantage, defined as the ratio of the output force (load) to the input force (effort), can be found by rearranging the formula to: Mechanical Advantage = effort arm / load arm.",
    "explanation": "When a lever is balanced, the torques due to the forces on either side of the fulcrum cancel each other. This is expressed by the equation load arm × load = effort arm × effort.
