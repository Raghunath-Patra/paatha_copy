Operations with scalars follow the rules of ordinary algebra (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). In contrast, vector quantities have both magnitude and direction. Common vectors include displacement, velocity, and force, and they are added using the triangle or parallelogram laws. Examples from the text include the temperature of a body (scalar) and displacement (vector).",
    "explanation": "A clear understanding of the fundamental differences between scalars and vectors is essential in physics.

    "correct_answer": "The position vector of an object is used to describe its location relative to a chosen origin in a coordinate system. It is directed from the origin to the objectâ€™s position, and its magnitude represents the distance from the origin. When an object moves, its initial and final positions can be represented by two position vectors. The displacement vector is then obtained by drawing a straight line from the initial to the final position. This vector reflects the net change in position independent of the actual path taken.",
    "explanation": "By choosing an origin, every location in the plane can be uniquely determined using a position vector.

    "correct_answer": "Free vectors are those whose effect does not depend on their location; they can be shifted parallel to themselves without changing their physical meaning. In contrast, localized vectors have a specific point of application. When analyzing forces, free vectors simplify calculations by allowing forces to be moved to a common point for vector addition, while localized vectors are critical in determining moments and torques. For example, while the weight of an object is often treated as a free vector for equilibrium analysis, its point of application matters when calculating the torque about a pivot.",
    "explanation": "Understanding the distinction between free and localized vectors is essential, especially in mechanics. Free vectors allow for simplified vector addition because their point of application is irrelevant when calculating net force. However, in scenarios involving rotational effects, such as torques, the exact line of action (localized aspect) of the vector becomes crucial.",
