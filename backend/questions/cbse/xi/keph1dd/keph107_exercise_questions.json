    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "No, it is not possible to shield a body from gravity because gravitational forces are always attractive and there is no known material or configuration that can cancel or block gravitational fields.",
    "explanation": "Unlike electric fields, which can be cancelled by redistribution of charges (as in a conductor), gravitational fields arise from mass and are always attractive. There is no negative mass equivalent that would allow gravitational forces to cancel out, so putting an object inside a hollow sphere does not shield it from the gravitational influence of other nearby masses.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Because tidal forces depend on the gradient (differential) of the gravitational field, which decreases with the cube of the distance. The Moon is much closer to the Earth than the Sun, so even though the Sun’s overall gravitational pull is larger, the Moon produces a stronger differential force (tidal effect).",
    "explanation": "Tidal forces arise from the difference in gravitational acceleration between the near and far sides of the Earth. Since this difference varies as 1/(distance)^3, the much smaller distance to the Moon makes its tidal influence stronger compared to the distant Sun.",

    "question_text": "Two stars, each of one solar mass (2 × 10^30 kg), are approaching each other for a head-on collision. When they are a distance of 10^9 km apart, their speeds are negligible. What is the speed with which they collide? (The radius of each star is 10^4 km. Assume the stars remain undistorted until they collide.)",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 2.6 × 10^6 m/s.",
    "explanation": "By conserving energy, the loss in gravitational potential energy as the stars move from an initial separation (approximately 10^9 km) to collision (when their centres are about 2 × 10^4 km apart) is converted into kinetic energy. Neglecting the initial separation term (since it is much larger), the collision speed for each star can be approximated by v = sqrt(GM/r_final), which evaluates to roughly 2.6 × 10^6 m/s.",

    "question_text": "Two heavy spheres, each of mass 100 kg and radius 0.10 m, are placed 1.0 m apart on a horizontal table. What is the gravitational force and potential at the midpoint of the line joining their centres? Is an object placed at that point in equilibrium? If so, is the equilibrium stable or unstable?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The gravitational forces from the two spheres at the midpoint cancel each other, resulting in a net force of zero. However, the gravitational potential is the sum of the potentials due to each sphere, which is nonzero (approximately -2.67 × 10^-8 J/kg). The equilibrium at this point is unstable because a small displacement would create a net force pulling the object further away from the midpoint.",
    "explanation": "At the midpoint (0.5 m from each sphere), the magnitude of the gravitational force from each sphere is given by F = G(100 kg)(m)/0.5^2, and although these forces are equal in magnitude, they act in opposite directions along the line joining the centres, cancelling each other. However, the potentials (which are scalar quantities) add up. An object at the midpoint is in equilibrium, but because the potential has a maximum there rather than a minimum, the equilibrium is unstable.",
