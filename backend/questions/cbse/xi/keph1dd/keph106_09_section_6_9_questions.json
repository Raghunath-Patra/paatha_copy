However, note that the system's total mass M is 5 kg. Using the formula for a rod with masses at its ends, I = M L2/12 for a continuous rod is not applicable here since masses are point-like. Instead, using the definition I = sum(m r^2) gives I = 5 kg * 1^2 = 5 kg m2. Realizing the original textbook example for a rod with two masses uses I = M L2/4, reconsider the configuration: If the entire mass (M = 5 kg) were distributed as two point masses at L/2 = 1 m each, then I = (5* (2^2)/4) = (5*4)/4 = 5 kg m2.
