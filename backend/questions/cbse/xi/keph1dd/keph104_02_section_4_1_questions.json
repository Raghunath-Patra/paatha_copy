    "correct_answer": "External forces are responsible for initiating motion by overcoming inertia, such as a football being kicked. Once in motion, if no net force is present, the body continues with uniform motion, like a skater on frictionless ice.

    "correct_answer": "In a frictionless environment, there are no resistive forces to counteract the motion.

Everyday experiences usually involve friction or air resistance, which require additional force to overcome, leading to the misconception that a continuous force is needed.",
