Aryabhatta was among the first to hint at such a model, while Copernicus provided a more definitive formulation in which planets move in circular orbits around the sun. Galileo supported this model through his observations and experiments, such as the phases of Venus and the motion of objects under gravity, despite facing persecution for his views.",

The justification lies in leveraging advanced technology to refine measurements and test the limits of the universality of gravitational acceleration under varied conditions.",
