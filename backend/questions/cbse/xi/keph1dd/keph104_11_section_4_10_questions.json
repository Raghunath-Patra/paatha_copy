    "correct_answer": "On a level road, the only horizontal force is friction, giving the equation m·v²/R = f ≤ μs·m·g, leading to v_max = √(μs·R·g). On a banked road, forces are resolved into vertical and horizontal components. Vertical equilibrium gives N·cosθ - f·sinθ = m·g, and horizontal equilibrium (centripetal requirement) gives N·sinθ + f·cosθ = m·v²/R. In the limiting case, taking f = μs·N allows derivations that yield v_max = √(R·g·(μs + tanθ)/(1 - μs·tanθ)) while the optimum (frictionless) speed is v0 = √(R·g·tanθ).",
    "explanation": "The explanation involves resolving the forces acting on the car. On a level road, since there is no bank angle, the friction force directly provides the centripetal force. In contrast, a banked road has the additional component of the normal force contributing to centripetal acceleration.

The horizontal equilibrium is given by N·sinθ + μs·N·cosθ = m·v²/R. Substituting for N and solving for v yields v_max = √(R·g·(μs + tanθ)/(1 - μs·tanθ)). In the frictionless case (μs = 0), the optimum speed becomes v0 = √(R·g·tanθ). Hence, v_max exceeds v0 due to the additional support from friction.",
    "explanation": "This derivation involves balancing forces in both the vertical and horizontal directions. The vertical force balance ensures that the normal force and friction combine to counteract weight, whereas the horizontal component provides the centripetal force.

    "correct_answer": "Banked roads are designed to minimize the need for friction to act as the sole provider of centripetal force. At the optimum speed (v0 = √(R·g·tanθ)), the horizontal component of the normal reaction supplies the exact centripetal force, thereby reducing reliance on friction. This reduction in friction minimizes tyre wear and improves safety. Additionally, the maximum permissible speed on a banked road is higher compared to a flat road because the combination of normal force and friction can provide greater centripetal force.",
    "explanation": "Designing banked roads allows vehicles to negotiate curves at higher speeds without depending exclusively on friction. This not only increases safety by reducing skidding accidents but also decreases tyre wear, as frictional forces are minimized at the optimum speed.
