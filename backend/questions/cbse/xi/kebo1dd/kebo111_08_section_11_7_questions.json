    "correct_answer": "The Calvin cycle begins with carboxylation, where CO₂ is fixed to RuBP forming 3-phosphoglyceric acid via the enzyme RuBisCO. In the reduction stage, ATP and NADPH reduce 3-PGA to form triose phosphate, which is the precursor to glucose. Finally, in the regeneration stage, ATP is used to re-form RuBP from triose phosphate, ensuring the cycle continues. Six complete turns of the cycle are required to synthesize one molecule of glucose.",

    "correct_answer": "In the C3 pathway, the first stable product is 3-phosphoglyceric acid (a 3-carbon compound), whereas in the C4 pathway, the initial fixation product is oxaloacetic acid (a 4-carbon compound). These differences affect the plant's efficiency in various environments. C4 plants typically have adaptations that allow them to efficiently fix CO₂ even when its concentration is low, but this process can require different energy investments. The reliance on specific amounts of ATP and NADPH in the Calvin cycle may also be adjusted based on the pathway, with cyclic photophosphorylation helping to meet the extra ATP demand in the biosynthetic processes.",
