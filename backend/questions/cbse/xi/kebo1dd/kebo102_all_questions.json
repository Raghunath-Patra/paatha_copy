    "correct_answer": "Classification systems have evolved from simple two-kingdom systems (plants and animals) to more complex systems that include additional kingdoms such as Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. Advances in microscopy, biochemical studies, and molecular genetics have driven these changes, leading to further subdivisions and reclassifications, including the recognition of acellular entities like viruses, viroids, prions, and lichens.",
    "explanation": "Over time, the discovery of new organisms and advancements in scientific techniques have necessitated changes in classification. This process reflects deeper understanding of the diversity of life, resulting in the addition or reassignment of various groups. The evolution of classification systems illustrates the historical progression of biological knowledge and methods.",

    "explanation": "Protozoans are diverse and categorized based on their locomotion and feeding mechanisms.

    "correct_answer": "Phycomycetes are typically aquatic or found on decaying matter; they have aseptate, coenocytic mycelium and reproduce asexually via zoospores or aplanospores, as well as sexually by forming zygospores. Ascomycetes, or sac-fungi, have septate and branched mycelium and reproduce asexually through conidia produced on conidiophores; sexually, they form ascospores within sac-like asci organized in ascocarps. Basidiomycetes have septate mycelium as well and primarily reproduce sexually, forming basidiospores on basidia that are arranged in basidiocarps; vegetative reproduction can also occur. Deuteromycetes, known as imperfect fungi, are classified based on their asexual reproduction via conidia, as their sexual stages are not observed.",
    "explanation": "The classes of fungi are distinguished by the characteristics of their mycelium and reproductive structures. Phycomycetes exhibit simple, often coenocytic hyphae and have both asexual and sexual reproductive methods. Ascomycetes are known for their sac-like asci and organized fruiting bodies, while basidiomycetes form distinct basidia on structured fruiting bodies like mushrooms.

They are inert outside a host cell and require the host’s machinery for replication. Common viral diseases include mumps, smallpox, herpes, and influenza (with AIDS also caused by a virus).",

Archaebacteria have a unique cell wall structure that enables them to survive in extreme conditions such as high salinity, temperature, and marshy environments. In contrast, eubacteria possess a rigid cell wall which, along with structures like flagella, helps in protection and motility.

    "correct_answer": "Binary fission in bacteria is an asexual reproductive process where a single bacterial cell replicates its DNA and divides into two identical daughter cells. The process begins with the replication of the bacterium's DNA. Then, the cell membrane invaginates, and the cytoplasm divides, aided by the cell wall which provides rigidity and protection. This process is efficient for rapid population growth under favorable conditions, as it ensures that every daughter cell inherits a complete copy of the genetic material.",
