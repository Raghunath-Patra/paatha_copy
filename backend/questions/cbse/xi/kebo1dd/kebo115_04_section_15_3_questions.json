    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The cardiac cycle begins with joint diastole, where both atria and ventricles are relaxed. Blood flows from the veins into the atria, and subsequently into the ventricles. The sinoatrial node fires, causing atrial systole, which boosts ventricular filling. The impulse then reaches the ventricles through the atrioventricular node and bundle, leading to ventricular systole. As the ventricles contract, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves close to prevent backflow, and increasing pressure opens the semilunar valves allowing blood to enter the pulmonary artery and aorta. After ejection, the ventricles relax (ventricular diastole), leading to closure of the semilunar valves. Finally, the pressure difference reopens the atrioventricular valves, allowing blood to refill the chambers, and the cycle starts anew.",

In contrast, chordates (and other animals with closed systems) have blood confined within vessels, allowing for precise regulation of blood flow and pressure. The closed system is more efficient in nutrient and gas transport due to confined pathways and regulated circulation.",
