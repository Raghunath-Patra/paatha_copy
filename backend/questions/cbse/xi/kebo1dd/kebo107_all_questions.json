The stomach secretes gastric juices for digestion, and partially digested food (chyme) moves into the duodenum where it mixes with bile and pancreatic juices. Final digestion and absorption occur in the intestine through the action of villi and microvilli. The undigested solid waste is then passed into the rectum and eliminated through the cloaca.",

The sinus venosus receives blood via the vena cava and directs it to the right atrium. Blood then enters the ventricle, which pumps it into the conus arteriosus and then to the arterial system. In addition, frogs possess special venous connections such as the hepatic portal system and renal portal system.

For instance, the human heart, with its four types of tissues, is more complex than simpler pump-like structures found in some simpler organisms. However, this trend does not imply that evolution always results in increased complexity, but rather that complexity can be a beneficial adaptation in certain environments.",

    "correct_answer": "A proposed model could involve a comprehensive study combining dissection, imaging techniques, and histological analysis. First, external morphology would be documented by photographing and mapping the external features of frogs. Then, internal anatomy would be explored via dissection and microscopy to identify tissue types and organ arrangements. This model would allow comparison with other vertebrates, thereby highlighting evolutionary adaptations and trends in organ system organization. Such an integrated approach not only advances our understanding of vertebrate structure but also sheds light on evolutionary processes that govern form and function.",
    "explanation": "The answer should detail a multi-step research model that includes both external and internal analyses. It should also explain how studying frog morphology and anatomy can reveal evolutionary information, linking structure to function.",
