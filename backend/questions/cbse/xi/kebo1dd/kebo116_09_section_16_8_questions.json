    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hemodialysis involves draining blood from a convenient artery and pumping it into an artificial kidney, where the blood passes through a coiled cellophane tube surrounded by a dialysing fluid. This fluid, which has a similar composition to plasma minus nitrogenous wastes, creates a concentration gradient allowing toxic substances like urea to diffuse out of the blood through the porous cellophane membrane. The cleared blood is then returned to the body via a vein after neutralizing the anticoagulant effects. This process effectively removes harmful waste products from the blood, providing life-saving support for patients with kidney failure.",

    "correct_answer": "Kidney transplantation offers a more permanent solution by restoring natural kidney function, which can improve quality of life and reduce the restrictions associated with regular dialysis sessions. However, it comes with challenges such as the risk of immune rejection, the need for a compatible donor (often a close relative), and complex surgical procedures.

    "correct_answer": "If the anticoagulant heparin is not managed properly during hemodialysis, there is a risk of blood clotting in the dialyzing unit, which could block the artificial kidney and disrupt the filtration process. Conversely, excessive anticoagulation could lead to bleeding complications. Both scenarios may compromise the effectiveness of the treatment and put the patient at increased risk of complications. Therefore, precise control and monitoring of anticoagulant dosage are critical to ensuring both safety and efficacy during the hemodialysis process.",
