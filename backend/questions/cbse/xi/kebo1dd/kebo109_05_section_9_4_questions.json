    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Proteins being heteropolymers means they are composed of a variety of amino acids, unlike homopolymers which consist of only one type. This diversity in amino acid composition allows proteins to adopt unique three-dimensional structures, which in turn determine their specific functions. The presence of different side chains allows for varied chemical properties and interactions, making it possible for proteins to function as enzymes, hormones, structural elements, antibodies, and more. This diversity is critical to the complexity and specialization found in biological systems.",

    "correct_answer": "One possible experimental setup involves culturing cells in two different media: one complete medium containing all amino acids, and another medium lacking one or more essential amino acids. Cells grown in the complete medium should exhibit normal growth and protein synthesis, while cells in the deficient medium would show reduced growth, altered metabolic activity, and decreased protein synthesis. Observing these differences would demonstrate the critical role of essential amino acids in maintaining cellular function.",
