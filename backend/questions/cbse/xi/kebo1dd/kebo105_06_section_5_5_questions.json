    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The flower begins as a bud with small, fused or free floral organs, including developing petals, stamens, and pistil. As it opens, the petals spread, and the stamens and pistil become fully mature to allow for pollination. After fertilization, the petals close or fall off, the ovary enlarges, and seeds develop inside, ensuring the continuation of the plant species. This process is essential as it allows for genetic recombination and the production of viable seeds.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines the stages of flower development: early bud with developing floral parts; full maturation where pollination can occur; and post-fertilization where the ovary matures into a fruit containing seeds.

Perigynous flowers have the gynoecium in the center with the other floral parts arranged around it at the rim of the thalamus, making the ovary half inferior. In epigynous flowers, the thalamus grows upward to completely enclose and fuse with the ovary, resulting in an inferior ovary with the other parts arising above it.",
    "explanation": "The answer delineates the three flower types based on the position of the gynoecium.
