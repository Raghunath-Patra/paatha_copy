Mitochondria generate ATP through aerobic respiration, with energy-producing processes occurring along the cristae and within the matrix. In contrast, chloroplasts capture light energy to drive photosynthesis; they have thylakoid membranes organized into grana to maximize light absorption and stroma where the Calvin cycle takes place. Although both organelles contain their own DNA and ribosomes and divide by fission, their roles in energy transformation differ significantly in terms of substrates and environmental conditions.",

    "correct_answer": "The cytoskeleton is a network of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments that provides structural support, maintains cell shape, and enables intracellular transport. Cilia and flagella, which extend from the cell surface, contain a 9+2 arrangement of microtubules and are responsible for motility either of the cell itself or of extracellular fluids.
