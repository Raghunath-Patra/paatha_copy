    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "a) Respiration is a controlled, enzyme-mediated process occurring in living cells to produce ATP, whereas combustion is a rapid, uncontrolled oxidation reaction that produces heat and light. b) Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate in the cytoplasm, while the Krebs' cycle (citric acid cycle) is a cyclic process in the mitochondrial matrix that further oxidizes acetyl CoA to CO2 while generating NADH, FADH2, and GTP/ATP. c) Aerobic respiration uses oxygen to completely oxidize substrates to CO2 and H2O with high ATP yield, whereas fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen and results in partial oxidation of glucose with a much lower ATP yield.",
    "explanation": "These answers differentiate the processes based on the nature, location, and energy yield. Respiration in cells is highly regulated, unlike combustion which is an uncontrolled exothermic process. Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are distinct stages in the breakdown of glucose, where glycolysis occurs in the cytosol and the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria. Aerobic respiration involves the use of oxygen and yields a high ATP output, while fermentation, which regenerates NAD+ under anaerobic conditions, produces far less ATP.",

Fructose-6-phosphate is then phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which is split into two three-carbon molecules (dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde).

This controlled release facilitates coupling of specific reactions to ATP synthesis and minimizes energy waste.",
    "explanation": "By oxidizing glucose in several small steps, the cell ensures that each individual reaction releases just enough energy to drive the synthesis of ATP or other useful intermediates, rather than a sudden, uncontrolled energy burst that would be dissipated as heat.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Glycolysis involves ten enzymatically controlled reactions. Initially, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase, requiring one ATP molecule. Fructose-6-phosphate then becomes fructose-1,6-bisphosphate using another ATP. This molecule is split into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and PGAL. PGAL is oxidized to 1, 3-BPGA while reducing NAD+ to NADH. Later steps, including the conversion of 1,3-BPGA to 3-phosphoglyceric acid and conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid, produce ATP. These steps collectively prepare the cell for further energy production and provide important intermediates for other metabolic processes.",

    "correct_answer": "Glycolysis is fundamental to cellular respiration because it initiates glucose metabolism in all cells. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate produced from glycolysis enters the Krebs cycle for complete oxidation to CO₂ and H₂O, yielding a high amount of ATP. Under anaerobic conditions, cells rely on fermentation (lactic acid or alcoholic) to regenerate NAD+, allowing glycolysis to continue but with lower ATP yields.
