    "correct_answer": "Growth is the irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ, its parts, or a cell; differentiation refers to the process by which cells change structurally and functionally to become specialized; development is the sum of all changes an organism undergoes from germination to senescence; dedifferentiation is the process by which fully differentiated cells regain the capacity to divide; redifferentiation is the subsequent process by which these cells specialize again; determinate growth is growth that ceases once a genetically pre-determined form is reached; a meristem is a region in plants containing undifferentiated cells capable of division; growth rate is the amount of growth per unit time.",
    "explanation": "Each term is explicitly defined in the chapter. Growth involves an irreversible increase in size, while differentiation explains how cells acquire specialized functions. Development encompasses both growth and differentiation over the life cycle. Dedifferentiation and redifferentiation describe the plasticity in plant cell fate, and the meristem is the key region driving continuous plant growth. Growth rate quantifies how fast growth occurs.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Because growth in plants is multifaceted, involving increases in cell number, cell size, biomass (fresh and dry weight), as well as changes in length, area, and volume. No single parameter can encompass these diverse aspects across different tissues and stages of development.",
    "explanation": "The chapter explains that growth is measured by several parameters such as fresh weight, dry weight, length, and cell number. Since different stages and organs may show changes in different dimensions, relying on one parameter would not accurately capture the overall growth of the plant.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Arithmetic growth is characterized by a constant increase in length (or other parameters) over time, representable by a straight-line graph (L(t) = L(0) + rt). Geometric growth involves exponential increase where all daughter cells continue dividing, resulting in a rapid increase and is expressed as W1 = W0 e^(rt). A sigmoid growth curve starts slowly (lag phase), accelerates during the exponential phase, then levels off during the stationary phase. Absolute growth rate is the total increase in a parameter per unit time, while relative growth rate is the increase measured per unit of the initial parameter.",
    "explanation": "The chapter details arithmetic growth as a constant rate and geometric growth as exponential due to continued cell division. The sigmoid curve is typical in natural organisms due to initial adaptation, followed by rapid growth and finally stabilization. Absolute and relative growth rates provide measures for comparing overall versus proportional growth, respectively.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The five main groups are: auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, and abscisic acid (ABA). For example, auxins (such as indole-3-acetic acid) were discovered from experiments with coleoptiles, and they control cell elongation, apical dominance, rooting, and phenomena such as phototropism. They are used in rooting cuttings, promoting flowering in some crops, and as herbicides in synthetic forms like 2,4-D.",
    "explanation": "The chapter explains the history and discovery of each group of plant growth regulators. Auxins, for instance, were isolated from coleoptile tips and are crucial for several growth processes including cell elongation and apical dominance. Their use in agriculture and horticulture is widespread, including applications in rooting and weed control. The answer covers both the listing of the groups and an in-depth example of one regulator.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Abscisic acid (ABA) is known as the stress hormone because it is produced in response to various abiotic stresses and helps the plant manage these conditions by inhibiting growth, inducing stomatal closure, and promoting dormancy.",
    "explanation": "The chapter describes ABA as a growth inhibitor that stimulates responses like stomatal closure and seed dormancy, which are key adaptations for surviving stressful environmental conditions. It is thus termed the stress hormone.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In higher plants, growth is considered 'open' because it can continue indefinitely due to the presence of meristems, and differentiation is 'open' because the same meristematic cells can give rise to a variety of differentiated tissues depending on their position and environmental signals.",
    "explanation": "The chapter highlights that plant growth is indeterminate due to meristems, and differentiation varies with cell location, meaning cells arising from the same meristem can follow diverse developmental paths. This reflects the open nature of both growth and differentiation in plants.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "This can occur because the plants may have different intrinsic sensitivity thresholds to photoperiod. Environmental factors such as temperature, light intensity, and other hormones can override photoperiodic requirements so that both types can reach the flowering stage simultaneously when conditions are optimal.",
    "explanation": "The chapter suggests that while photoperiod is an important environmental cue, other factors can modulate flowering time. Hence, under favorable conditions, both short day and long day plants might flower at the same time as their internal regulatory systems respond to a combination of cues.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "explanation": "Based on the chapter, auxins are key in rooting, ethylene in fruit ripening, cytokinins counteract senescence and promote bud growth, gibberellins induce bolting by elongating internodes, and ABA triggers stomatal closure.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A defoliated plant may have a diminished response to the photoperiodic cycle because leaves are critical in perceiving light cues and synthesizing hormones that influence photoperiodic responses.",
    "explanation": "The chapter implies that leaves play an important role in detecting light and relaying information that affects flowering and other developmental processes. Without leaves, the plant’s ability to accurately measure daylength and respond accordingly is compromised.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) GA₃ application would result in enhanced internode elongation leading to taller rice seedlings, (b) if dividing cells cease to differentiate, the result may be an overproduction of undifferentiated cells or callus formation, (c) a rotten fruit would release ethylene causing the unripe fruits to ripen prematurely, (d) absence of cytokinin in culture medium would hinder shoot formation and may favor root development in callus cultures.",
    "explanation": "GA₃ is known for promoting stem elongation. Without differentiation, cells remain in a proliferative, undifferentiated state. Ethylene released by rotten fruits accelerates ripening, and in tissue culture, the balance of auxin and cytokinin is crucial for directing organogenesis; lacking cytokinin often shifts development toward rooting rather than shoot formation.",
