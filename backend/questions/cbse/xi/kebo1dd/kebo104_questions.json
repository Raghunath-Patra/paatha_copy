    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Without considering fundamental features, it becomes difficult to group animals based on internal similarities, their evolutionary relationships remain ambiguous, and there is increased likelihood of misclassifying organisms that have dissimilar external forms but similar internal organization.",
    "explanation": "The classification system relies on common features such as level of organization, symmetry, coelom, and system development. Without these criteria, grouping animals becomes subjective and inconsistent, leading to misunderstandings about evolutionary relationships.",

    "correct_answer": "Examine its level of organization (cellular, tissue, organ, or organ-system), determine its symmetry (radial, bilateral, or asymmetrical), identify the type of body cavity (coelom, pseudocoelom, or acoelom), check for segmentation, and look for distinctive features such as specialized structures. Also include analysis of digestive, circulatory, and reproductive systems.",
    "explanation": "Classification involves a systematic approach: starting with the overall cellular organization, followed by noting body symmetry, the type of body cavity present, signs of segmentation, and then examining the design of various organ systems.
