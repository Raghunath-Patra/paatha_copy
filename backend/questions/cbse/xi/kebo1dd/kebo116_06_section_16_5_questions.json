    "correct_answer": "Both ADH and the renin-angiotensin system work via hormonal feedback to regulate kidney function. Osmoreceptors detect fluid imbalances and stimulate ADH release during dehydration, enhancing water reabsorption to conserve body fluid. Conversely, a decrease in GFR stimulates the juxtaglomerular apparatus to release renin, initiating the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and then angiotensin II, which raises the glomerular blood pressure and GFR. Additionally, angiotensin II triggers aldosterone release, further increasing sodium and water reabsorption. Together, these systems ensure that blood volume and pressure are maintained within normal ranges.",

    "correct_answer": "These mechanisms integrate in a dynamic balance. When blood volume is low, osmoreceptors stimulate ADH release, ensuring water reabsorption. Simultaneously, reduced GFR triggers renin release, which through angiotensin II production, causes vasoconstriction, thereby increasing glomerular pressure and GFR. Angiotensin II also induces aldosterone release, increasing sodium and water reabsorption. In contrast, increased atrial blood flow promotes ANF release, leading to vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure. The interplay between these systems allows the body to finely tune blood pressure and fluid balance.",

The inability to properly regulate fluid balance could further impair the renin-angiotensin mechanism, compounding issues with blood pressure regulation.",
