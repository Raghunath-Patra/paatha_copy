    "correct_answer": "The process begins with extraction, where organic compounds are removed from the tissue sample using an appropriate solvent. Next, the extract is subjected to various separation techniques, such as chromatography, to isolate a single compound from the mixture. Once isolated, purification procedures are carried out to ensure that the compound is free of contaminants. Finally, analytical techniques including spectroscopy and mass spectrometry are used to determine the molecular formula and possible structure of the compound. Each step is crucial: extraction gathers the compounds, separation isolates the desired compound, purification ensures accuracy, and analytical techniques reveal structural details.",

At low pH, the amino group is protonated and the carboxyl group remains largely non-ionized; at high pH, the carboxyl group is deprotonated while the amino group loses protons. At the isoelectric point, the molecule exists as a zwitterion with both positive and negative charges. These changes influence the solubility, reactivity, and overall three-dimensional structure of proteins, as the charge distribution affects hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions during protein folding.",
