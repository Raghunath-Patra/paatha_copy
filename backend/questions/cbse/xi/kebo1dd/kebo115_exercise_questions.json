    "correct_answer": "The formed elements of blood include erythrocytes, leucocytes, and platelets. Erythrocytes (red blood cells) are mainly responsible for gas transport (carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide); leucocytes (white blood cells) play a key role in defense mechanisms and immune responses; and platelets are crucial for blood clotting (coagulation).",
    "explanation": "This answer lists the three formed elements present in blood and explains the primary function of each. Erythrocytes are abundant and carry hemoglobin, leucocytes are involved in immunity and fighting infections, and platelets contribute to the clotting process necessary to prevent blood loss.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Blood is considered a connective tissue because it originates from mesenchymal cells, consists of a fluid matrix (plasma) in which cells (formed elements) are suspended, and helps in connecting body systems by transporting nutrients, gases, waste products, and immune cells.",
    "explanation": "Unlike typical tissues, blood has a liquid extracellular matrix (plasma) that binds various cellular components, which is a key characteristic of connective tissues. Its role in transport and defense further supports its classification as connective tissue.",

    "explanation": "The primary differences lie in composition and function. Blood contains components like red and white cells and platelets along with clotting factors and proteins, while lymph is mostly a filtrate of plasma, maintaining similar mineral balance but without the cellular elements and clotting proteins, and mainly carries lymphocytes for immune responses.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Double circulation refers to the separation of the circulatory pathway into two distinct circuits: one circuit carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) and the other circuit carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body (systemic circulation). Its significance lies in allowing efficient oxygenation of blood and ensuring that oxygen-rich blood is delivered separately to the tissues, thereby maximizing the efficiency of nutrient and gas exchange.",
    "explanation": "By separating the flow of blood into pulmonary and systemic circuits, the heart ensures that deoxygenated and oxygenated blood do not mix, which increases the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs and the delivery of oxygen to tissues. This separation is critical for maintaining high metabolic activity in organs.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Blood is a fluid connective tissue that contains plasma, cells, and clotting factors, whereas lymph is derived from the interstitial fluid, lacking most formed elements and clotting factors. (b) In an open circulatory system, blood flows freely into body cavities (sinuses) and is not confined entirely within vessels, while in a closed system, blood is contained within a network of vessels. (c) Systole is the phase of the cardiac cycle during which the heart muscles contract and pump blood out of the chambers, while diastole is the relaxation phase when the heart chambers fill with blood. (d) The P-wave of an ECG represents the depolarization (excitation) of the atria, whereas the T-wave represents the repolarization (return to resting state) of the ventricles.",
    "explanation": "Each part of the question requires comparing two related concepts. The answer clearly differentiates between blood and lymph by composition and function, distinguishes between the open and closed circulatory systems based on the confinement of blood, contrasts systole and diastole based on the phases of heart activity, and explains the distinct features of ECG segments (P-wave vs. T-wave).",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The evolution of the heart in vertebrates shows a progression from simple to complex structures. Fishes possess a 2-chambered heart with a single circulation system. Amphibians and most reptiles have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and one ventricle, leading to incomplete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. In contrast, birds and mammals have a 4-chambered heart with complete separation of the atria and ventricles, which allows for double circulation and more efficient oxygenation.",

    "correct_answer": "Our heart is called myogenic because it has the inherent ability to generate its own electrical impulses without any external stimulation, due to the specialized nodal tissues within the cardiac muscle.",

    "explanation": "The sino-atrial node's autoexcitable property and its ability to set the pace of the heartâ€™s contractions make it the natural pacemaker, ensuring that the heart beats in a regular and coordinated manner.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The atrio-ventricular (AV) node and AV bundle are critical for the proper conduction and timing of electrical impulses. The AV node delays the impulse from the atria, allowing the ventricles enough time to fill with blood, while the AV bundle transmits the impulse through the ventricular septum to ensure that the ventricular contraction occurs in a coordinated manner.",
    "explanation": "The delay provided by the AV node ensures efficient filling of the ventricles, and the conduction through the AV bundle (and further branching into Purkinje fibers) guarantees that the contraction of the ventricles is synchronized, which is essential for effective pumping of blood.",

Cardiac output is defined as the amount of blood pumped out by each ventricle per minute, typically about 5000 mL in a healthy individual.",
    "explanation": "The cardiac cycle encompasses all the phases of heart activity that occur with each beat. Cardiac output, calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate, measures the efficiency of the heart in maintaining circulation.",

The first heart sound ('lub') is associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid (mitral) valves, while the second heart sound ('dub') is related to the closure of the semilunar valves. These sounds are important for diagnosing cardiac function.",

The intervals and segments between these waves (such as the PR interval and ST segment) provide information about the conduction time and recovery of the heart muscle.",
    "explanation": "This answer outlines the major components of an ECG tracing, correlating each segment with specific electrical events in the heart. The P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave are fundamental in diagnosing cardiac conditions, and their analysis helps in assessing the heartâ€™s rhythm and function.",
