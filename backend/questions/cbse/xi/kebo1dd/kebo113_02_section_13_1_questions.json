    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Meristems are groups of undifferentiated cells that have the ability to divide indefinitely, thus allowing continuous addition of new cells to the plant body, a process known as open form of growth. If meristem cells were to cease dividing, the plant would lose its ability to grow further in length or develop new organs, severely limiting its ability to adapt to environmental changes or repair damaged tissues.",

    "correct_answer": "Arithmetic growth, exemplified by the linear increase in root length, involves a constant rate where only one daughter cell continues to divide after each mitotic event. In contrast, geometric growth occurs when all progeny cells retain the ability to divide, leading to a rapid exponential increase in cell number or size, as seen in the exponential phase of growth with a sigmoid curve. Each pattern reflects different growth strategies based on cellular division and differentiation.",
    "explanation": "This answer requires understanding of both arithmetic (linear) and geometric (exponential) growth, and highlights that while arithmetic growth leads to a constant increase (as seen in root elongation), geometric growth allows for a sudden and steep rise in cell numbers under optimal conditions.",
