    "correct_answer": "Growth is the irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ, its parts, or a cell; differentiation refers to the process by which cells change structurally and functionally to become specialized; development is the sum of all changes an organism undergoes from germination to senescence; dedifferentiation is the process by which fully differentiated cells regain the capacity to divide; redifferentiation is the subsequent process by which these cells specialize again; determinate growth is growth that ceases once a genetically pre-determined form is reached; a meristem is a region in plants containing undifferentiated cells capable of division; growth rate is the amount of growth per unit time.",
    "explanation": "Each term is explicitly defined in the chapter. Growth involves an irreversible increase in size, while differentiation explains how cells acquire specialized functions. Development encompasses both growth and differentiation over the life cycle. Dedifferentiation and redifferentiation describe the plasticity in plant cell fate, and the meristem is the key region driving continuous plant growth. Growth rate quantifies how fast growth occurs.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Because growth in plants is multifaceted, involving increases in cell number, cell size, biomass (fresh and dry weight), as well as changes in length, area, and volume. No single parameter can encompass these diverse aspects across different tissues and stages of development.",
    "explanation": "The chapter explains that growth is measured by several parameters such as fresh weight, dry weight, length, and cell number.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Arithmetic growth is characterized by a constant increase in length (or other parameters) over time, representable by a straight-line graph (L(t) = L(0) + rt). Geometric growth involves exponential increase where all daughter cells continue dividing, resulting in a rapid increase and is expressed as W1 = W0 e^(rt). A sigmoid growth curve starts slowly (lag phase), accelerates during the exponential phase, then levels off during the stationary phase. Absolute growth rate is the total increase in a parameter per unit time, while relative growth rate is the increase measured per unit of the initial parameter.",
    "explanation": "The chapter details arithmetic growth as a constant rate and geometric growth as exponential due to continued cell division. The sigmoid curve is typical in natural organisms due to initial adaptation, followed by rapid growth and finally stabilization.

    "correct_answer": "The five main groups are: auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, and abscisic acid (ABA). For example, auxins (such as indole-3-acetic acid) were discovered from experiments with coleoptiles, and they control cell elongation, apical dominance, rooting, and phenomena such as phototropism. They are used in rooting cuttings, promoting flowering in some crops, and as herbicides in synthetic forms like 2,4-D.",
    "explanation": "The chapter explains the history and discovery of each group of plant growth regulators. Auxins, for instance, were isolated from coleoptile tips and are crucial for several growth processes including cell elongation and apical dominance.

Environmental factors such as temperature, light intensity, and other hormones can override photoperiodic requirements so that both types can reach the flowering stage simultaneously when conditions are optimal.",
    "explanation": "The chapter suggests that while photoperiod is an important environmental cue, other factors can modulate flowering time.

    "explanation": "Based on the chapter, auxins are key in rooting, ethylene in fruit ripening, cytokinins counteract senescence and promote bud growth, gibberellins induce bolting by elongating internodes, and ABA triggers stomatal closure.

    "correct_answer": "(a) GA₃ application would result in enhanced internode elongation leading to taller rice seedlings, (b) if dividing cells cease to differentiate, the result may be an overproduction of undifferentiated cells or callus formation, (c) a rotten fruit would release ethylene causing the unripe fruits to ripen prematurely, (d) absence of cytokinin in culture medium would hinder shoot formation and may favor root development in callus cultures.",
    "explanation": "GA₃ is known for promoting stem elongation. Without differentiation, cells remain in a proliferative, undifferentiated state. Ethylene released by rotten fruits accelerates ripening, and in tissue culture, the balance of auxin and cytokinin is crucial for directing organogenesis; lacking cytokinin often shifts development toward rooting rather than shoot formation.",

In contrast, geometric growth occurs when all progeny cells retain the ability to divide, leading to a rapid exponential increase in cell number or size, as seen in the exponential phase of growth with a sigmoid curve. Each pattern reflects different growth strategies based on cellular division and differentiation.",
