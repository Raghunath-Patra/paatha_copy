The loop of Henle, through its descending limb (which is permeable to water) and ascending limb (which transports electrolytes), sets up an osmotic gradient essential for urine concentration. The DCT fine-tunes the chemical composition of the filtrate by conditionally reabsorbing sodium and water and secreting hydrogen and potassium ions, thus regulating pH and ionic balance. Finally, the collecting duct reabsorbs additional water under the influence of the osmotic gradient maintained by the medullary interstitium, leaving behind a concentrated urine.",

    "correct_answer": "Selective secretion of hydrogen ions in the nephron, particularly in the PCT and DCT, is crucial for maintaining systemic pH balance. In the PCT, the secretion of H+ along with ammonia into the filtrate helps prevent acidosis by removing excess acid from the blood. Similarly, in the DCT, the controlled secretion of H+ fine-tunes the blood’s acid-base equilibrium.
