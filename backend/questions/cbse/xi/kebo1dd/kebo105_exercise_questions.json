    "question_text": "How is a pinnately compound leaf different from a palmately compound leaf?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In pinnately compound leaves, the leaflets are arranged along a common rachis, resembling a feather, whereas in palmately compound leaves all the leaflets arise from a single point at the end of the petiole, resembling the spread of a hand.",
    "explanation": "Pinnately compound leaves exhibit a central axis (rachis) with leaflets attached along both sides. In contrast, palmately compound leaves have all leaflets originating from one point at the petiole tip. This distinction is key to understanding leaf morphology in angiosperms.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Phyllotaxy refers to the pattern of leaf arrangement on a plant stem. Examples include alternate phyllotaxy, where one leaf is borne per node in a staggered pattern (e.g., china rose, mustard), opposite phyllotaxy, where two leaves arise from each node on opposite sides (e.g., Calotropis, guava), and whorled phyllotaxy, where three or more leaves arise at the same node forming a circle (e.g., Alstonia).",
    "explanation": "The answer describes the three main types of leaf arrangements: alternate (single leaf per node in an alternate pattern), opposite (pair of leaves per node at opposing sides) and whorled (three or more leaves from a single node). Examples from the chapter help in understanding these arrangements.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Aestivation is the arrangement of sepals or petals in a floral bud; placentation is the arrangement of ovules within the ovary; actinomorphic means having radial symmetry; zygomorphic means having bilateral symmetry; a superior ovary is one that is positioned above the attachment of other floral parts; a perigynous flower has floral parts attached around a cup-shaped thalamus resulting in a half-inferior ovary; epipetalous stamen refers to stamens that are attached to the petals.",
    "explanation": "Each term is defined based on the structural characteristics of flowers. Aestivation explains how sepals and petals are arranged before blooming, while placentation details ovule positions. Actinomorphic and zygomorphic describe the types of symmetry in flowers. Superior ovary and perigynous flowers relate to the position of the ovary relative to other parts, and epipetalous describes the specific attachment of stamens to petals.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Racemose inflorescence has an indeterminate main axis with flowers arranged in an acropetal succession, while cymose inflorescence has a determinate main axis that terminates in a flower with subsequent flowers developing basipetally. An apocarpous ovary consists of free, separate carpels, whereas a syncarpous ovary has carpels that are fused together.",
    "explanation": "The distinction in racemose inflorescence involves continuous growth of the main axis allowing sequential flower development from the base upward, unlike the cymose type where the growth stops at the terminal flower. Similarly, apocarpous ovaries have individually free carpels (as seen in some dicots), while syncarpous ovaries feature fused carpels, impacting the structure and development of the fruit.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For a gram seed (dicotyledonous), the diagram should include the seed coat with its two layers (testa and tegmen), hilum, and the internal embryo showing two cotyledons, radicle and plumule. For a maize seed (monocotyledonous), the diagram should depict the seed coat fused with the fruit wall, the large endosperm with an aleurone layer, and a small embryo with a single cotyledon (scutellum) along with the coleoptile, plumule, radicle, and coleorhiza.",
    "explanation": "The answer requires drawing two separate diagrams that capture the unique anatomical features of dicot (gram seed) and monocot (maize seed) seeds. The gram seed diagram must highlight the two distinct cotyledons along with the embryonic axis, while the maize seed diagram must emphasize the large endosperm, aleurone layer, and specialized structures such as the scutellum and protective sheaths.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A typical answer should include details such as the flower being solitary or arranged in axillary/cymose inflorescence, bisexual, and actinomorphic with a five-sepaled calyx (usually united with valvate aestivation), five united petals forming the corolla, five stamens that are epipetalous, and a bicarpellary, syncarpous gynoecium with a superior, bilocular ovary and axile placentation. The floral diagram should depict these features in concentric whorls on the thalamus.",
    "explanation": "The response must cover both descriptive and diagrammatic aspects of the Solanaceae flower. It should mention the vegetative background as well as the reproductive parts, and accurately represent the relationships and arrangement of floral parts in the diagram.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A flower is the reproductive unit of angiosperms, specialized for sexual reproduction. A typical flower consists of four whorls: the calyx (sepals) for protection, the corolla (petals) for attracting pollinators, the androecium (stamens) which produce pollen, and the gynoecium (carpels) which form the ovary, style, and stigma. Additional structures include the pedicel, and variations in these parts determine the type and symmetry of the flower.",

    "correct_answer": "Inflorescence is the arrangement or grouping of flowers on a plant’s floral axis. The differences in inflorescence types are mainly based on the growth pattern of the main axis: in racemose inflorescences the main axis continues to grow with flowers emerging acropetally, whereas in cymose inflorescences the main axis terminates in a flower with subsequent flowers developing in a basipetal order.",
    "explanation": "The answer should provide a definition of inflorescence and distinguish between the racemose and cymose types by describing how flower development originates from the floral axis. Examples from the chapter help to clarify these differences.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Floral members are arranged in concentric whorls on the thalamus. Typically, the calyx forms the outermost whorl, followed by the corolla, then the androecium, and finally the gynoecium in the center. The insertion of these parts can affect the relative position of the ovary, determining whether it is superior, half-inferior (perigynous), or inferior (epigynous).",
    "explanation": "This answer explains the systematic and concentric arrangement of the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium on the thalamus, and shows how variations in the insertion of these parts can alter the position of the ovary. Understanding this arrangement is fundamental in categorizing flower types.",
