    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, consisting of a glomerulus enclosed by Bowman's capsule (forming the Malpighian body) where blood filtration occurs. The filtrate then flows through the proximal convoluted tubule where essential substances are reabsorbed. Next, it passes through the loop of Henle, which has descending and ascending limbs that respectively reabsorb water and ions, creating a medullary concentration gradient. The filtrate then enters the distal convoluted tubule where further secretion and reabsorption take place. Finally, the urine is collected in the collecting duct, which converges into the renal pelvis and is then funneled to the ureter.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The kidney's structure is highly specialized to optimize its function. The cortex contains the glomeruli and the initial parts of the nephrons (including the malpighian corpuscle, proximal and distal convoluted tubules) which are crucial for filtering blood. The medulla contains the loop of Henle and the collecting ducts, which are essential for concentrating urine. The calyces, which receive urine from the collecting ducts, and the renal pelvis, which funnels urine from the calyces into the ureter, help in the efficient transportation and storage of urine. This spatial organization ensures that each function, from filtration to urine concentration, occurs in the most suitable environment within the kidney.",
    "explanation": "This answer elaborates on how different anatomical regions of the kidney are responsible for specific functions. The cortical region handles initial filtration and reabsorption, while the medulla and associated structures focus on concentrating and collecting urine.",
