    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Prophase I is the longest and most complex phase of meiosis I and is subdivided into five stages: Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene, and Diakinesis. During Leptotene, chromosomes become visible and start to condense. In Zygotene, homologous chromosomes begin to pair through synapsis, forming the synaptonemal complex. Pachytene is marked by the crossing over between non-sister chromatids at recombination nodules, increasing genetic diversity. Diplotene sees the dissolution of the synaptonemal complex with paired chromosomes remaining attached only at chiasmata, representing sites of crossover. Finally, in Diakinesis, chromosomes are fully condensed and preparation for metaphase begins with nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Meiosis I is characterized by the separation of homologous chromosomes and is preceded by a single round of DNA replication, resulting in two cells with duplicated chromosomes. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes align and recombine, which introduces genetic variation. In contrast, meiosis II resembles mitosis where the sister chromatids are separated without any further DNA replication, resulting in four haploid cells. Therefore, while meiosis I reduces the chromosome number, meiosis II ensures that the sister chromatids are equally divided, leading to the production of genetically distinct gametes.",
