    "correct_answer": "Prophase I is the longest and most complex phase of meiosis I and is subdivided into five stages: Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene, and Diakinesis. During Leptotene, chromosomes become visible and start to condense. In Zygotene, homologous chromosomes begin to pair through synapsis, forming the synaptonemal complex. Pachytene is marked by the crossing over between non-sister chromatids at recombination nodules, increasing genetic diversity. Diplotene sees the dissolution of the synaptonemal complex with paired chromosomes remaining attached only at chiasmata, representing sites of crossover. Finally, in Diakinesis, chromosomes are fully condensed and preparation for metaphase begins with nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation.",

    "correct_answer": "Chromosomal condensation during prophase compacts the DNA, making it easier to segregate without entanglement, while the movement of duplicated centrosomes and the formation of microtubule asters lay the groundwork for the spindle apparatus. During metaphase, the fully condensed chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, where attachment of spindle fibers at the kinetochores guarantees that each sister chromatid is connected to opposite poles. This coordinated series of events ensures that when chromatids separate in anaphase, each resulting daughter cell inherits an identical set of chromosomes.",
