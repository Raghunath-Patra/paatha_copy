    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Without common fundamental features such as levels of organization, symmetry, coelomic conditions, and segmentation, it becomes extremely difficult to distinguish among species because many morphological characteristics would be ambiguous or convergent across different groups, leading to misclassification.",
