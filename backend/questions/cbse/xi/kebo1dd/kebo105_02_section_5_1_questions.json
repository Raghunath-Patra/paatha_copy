    "correct_answer": "The taproot system, common in dicotyledonous plants, consists of a large, primary root that penetrates deep into the soil with secondary lateral roots. The fibrous root system, typical of monocots, is made up of numerous thin roots with no single dominant root, ensuring extensive surface area. Adventitious roots develop from parts of the plant other than the radicle, such as stems or nodes, and can provide support and additional nutrient absorption.

    "correct_answer": "Plants with taproot systems are often adapted to environments where deep penetration into soil is beneficial for accessing water and nutrients at greater depths. On the other hand, fibrous root systems spread widely to exploit shallow, moisture-rich layers in the soil, which is common in monocots. Adventitious roots provide additional anchorage and absorption, especially in unstable or nutrient-poor substrates.
