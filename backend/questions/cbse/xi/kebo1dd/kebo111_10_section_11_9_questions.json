    "correct_answer": "C3 plants perform the Calvin cycle entirely in the mesophyll cells, and their CO₂ fixation is directly affected by the competitive binding of O₂ by RuBisCO, leading to photorespiration. In contrast, C4 plants display spatial separation where the initial CO₂ fixation occurs in the mesophyll using PEP to produce OAA, which is then transported to the bundle sheath cells, where CO₂ is released for the Calvin cycle. This concentration of CO₂ around RuBisCO minimizes photorespiration. Also, the structural adaptation seen in C4 plants, such as Kranz anatomy, allows them to operate efficiently even under high light and temperature conditions.",

    "correct_answer": "In C4 plants, compartmentalization between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells allows the separation of initial CO₂ fixation and the Calvin cycle. In mesophyll cells, CO₂ is initially fixed by PEP into a four-carbon compound (oxaloacetate), which is then transported to bundle sheath cells.
