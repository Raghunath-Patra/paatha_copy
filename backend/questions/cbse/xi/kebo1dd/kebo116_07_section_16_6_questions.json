    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process of micturition involves a sophisticated interplay between involuntary reflexes and voluntary control. When the bladder fills with urine, the stretch receptors in its wall are activated and send signals to the CNS. The CNS then processes these signals and, based on the individual's discretion, sends motor commands that lead to contraction of the bladder’s smooth muscles and relaxation of the urethral sphincter. This coordination ensures that urine is released at the appropriate time and place. Additionally, while the reflex arc is involuntary, the initiation of the signal to allow urine passage is a voluntary act, showing how both automatic and controlled processes work together in micturition.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The normal process of urine excretion relies on the coordinated actions of the bladder smooth muscles and the urethral sphincter. As the bladder fills with urine, its walls stretch and send signals to the CNS. In response, the CNS initiates a coordinated action where the bladder smooth muscles contract to increase pressure inside the bladder, pushing urine towards the urethra. Simultaneously, the urethral sphincter relaxes, reducing resistance and allowing urine to be expelled. This synchronization ensures that urine is discharged efficiently and helps prevent involuntary leakage.",
