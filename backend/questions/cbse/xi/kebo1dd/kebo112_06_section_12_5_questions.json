In contrast, aerobic respiration completely degrades glucose into CO2 and H2O, resulting in a net gain of 38 ATP, with a very vigorous oxidation of NADH. The complete oxidation in aerobic respiration and the effective transfer of electrons in the ETS pathway result in a much higher energy yield, while fermentation is less efficient due to its limited metabolic processing and slower electron transfer rates.",
