    "correct_answer": "Macromolecules are large molecular weight compounds generally found in the acid insoluble fraction of cells. Examples include proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and, in some cases, lipids (as parts of membranes).",
    "explanation": "Macromolecules in living organisms are typically those with molecular weights above 10,000 daltons (except lipids that are found in the acid insoluble fraction due to their organization into membranes). They include polymers such as proteins (built from amino acids), nucleic acids (polynucleotides), and polysaccharides such as cellulose and glycogen.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The tertiary structure of proteins is the overall three-dimensional folding of a single polypeptide chain resulting from interactions among its amino acid side chains.",
    "explanation": "Tertiary structure refers to the complete three-dimensional conformation of a protein. After the formation of secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets, the protein chain folds into a compact structure driven by hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and disulphide bridges.",

    "correct_answer": "Some common qualitative tests include the Biuret test for proteins, the Sudan III (or Sudan IV) test for fats and oils, and the Ninhydrin test for amino acids. The procedure would involve applying these reagents to samples of fruit juice, saliva, sweat, and urine and observing the color changes or precipitate formation.",
    "explanation": "Qualitative tests are used to detect the presence of different classes of biomolecules. The Biuret test produces a color change in the presence of peptide bonds; the Sudan test stains lipids red or orange; and the Ninhydrin test yields a deep purple color in the presence of amino acids.
