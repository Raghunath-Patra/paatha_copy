    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The developmental sequence of a plant cell begins with a meristematic cell, which is undifferentiated and has the potential to divide. Initially, the cell undergoes plasmatic growth, increasing in size. This is followed by expansion or elongation, which further increases cell size. Next, the cell enters the maturation phase where it develops specialized structures and functions. Finally, the cell differentiates into a mature cell capable of performing specific tasks, and eventually, it can undergo senescence, leading to programmed cell death. Additionally, cell division from the meristematic cells replenishes the meristem, closing the developmental loop.",

    "correct_answer": "Plasticity in plant development refers to the ability of plants to adapt and form different structures in response to internal programming and external environmental factors. Heterophylly is an excellent example of plasticity, where plants produce leaves of different shapes depending on their developmental stage (juvenile vs adult) or based on the environment. For instance, certain plants such as larkspur exhibit simple juvenile leaves that later transform into more divided adult leaves, and plants like buttercup produce broader leaves in terrestrial environments and more dissected leaves in aquatic conditions. This flexibility allows plants to optimize their function and survival in varying conditions.",

    "correct_answer": "Intrinsic factors, such as genetic components and intercellular chemicals like plant growth regulators, determine the fundamental developmental blueprint and functionality of plant cells. On the other hand, extrinsic factors, including environmental elements like light, temperature, water, oxygen, and nutrition, modulate this genetic framework by influencing the rate and pattern of growth and differentiation. For example, while genetic factors will dictate the overall mode of development, the availability of water or light can lead to adaptive modifications such as heterophylly, where leaf shape varies based on environmental conditions.",
