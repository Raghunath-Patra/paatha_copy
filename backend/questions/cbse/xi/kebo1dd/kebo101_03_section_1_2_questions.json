    "correct_answer": "A hierarchical classification system organizes living organisms into nested groups which reflect their evolutionary relationships. It facilitates communication among scientists, helps in understanding biological diversity, and aids in predicting characteristics shared by organisms. By arranging organisms from species up to kingdom, each level provides more general information as you move upward, ensuring a systematic approach to studying life.",
    "explanation": "A hierarchical system not only simplifies the vast diversity of life by categorizing organisms based on shared traits but also provides a framework to study evolution and the relationships between different groups.

    "correct_answer": "Species are the most specific category, representing groups of individuals with fundamental similarities and distinctive morphological differences. Genus groups together species that share more characters in common compared to species in different genera. Family, a higher taxonomic category, aggregates related genera based on a set of shared characteristics, though the members show fewer common traits than species or genus. While species are narrowly defined, genus and family serve as broader classifications to reflect evolutionary relationships and structural similarities.",
    "explanation": "This comparison shows that as one moves from species to genus to family, the criteria for grouping become broader. Species have the highest level of similarity, genera group similar species, and families bring together related genera often based on additional vegetative or reproductive features.",
