Additionally, proper leaf arrangement can affect the display and accessibility of flowers to pollinators, indirectly enhancing the plant's reproductive success.",

    "correct_answer": "The diagram shows various developmental stages of flowers—from closed buds, which are pink, to fully opened yellow petals. This sequential development ensures that not all flowers bloom simultaneously, which can extend the period during which pollinators can visit the plant, thus enhancing pollination efficiency. The staggered bloom may also reduce competition among the flowers for pollinator attention, ensuring that each flower has a better chance of being pollinated.",
