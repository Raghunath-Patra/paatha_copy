    "correct_answer": "Blood coagulation is a cascade process that begins with an injury or trauma. Platelets at the injury site release substances that activate coagulation. Inactive fibrinogen in the plasma is converted by the enzyme thrombin into fibrin, forming a network of threads that trap blood cells, thereby forming a clot. Thrombin is itself generated from prothrombin through the action of thrombokinase, and calcium ions play an essential role in these reactions.",

During the first pregnancy, the mother might become sensitized to the fetal Rh antigens during delivery without affecting the first child. In subsequent pregnancies, the mother's anti-Rh antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy the fetal RBCs, leading to conditions like erythroblastosis foetalis.

    "correct_answer": "The composition of blood is finely tuned to perform specialized functions. Erythrocytes, loaded with haemoglobin, are critical for the transport of oxygen, while various white blood cells (leucocytes) play key roles in immune defense. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils respond quickly to pathogens as part of the innate immune system, whereas lymphocytes (T and B cells) are responsible for the adaptive immune responses. Platelets facilitate coagulation, preventing excessive blood loss. The interdependence of these components underscores the efficiency of blood in maintaining vital bodily functions.",
