    "correct_answer": "The CNS, comprising the brain and spinal cord, serves as the primary center for information processing and command control. In contrast, the PNS includes all nerves and related structures that connect the CNS to the rest of the body. The PNS is further divided into nerve fiber types (afferent and efferent) and functional divisions (somatic and autonomic). Afferent fibers carry sensory information to the CNS, while efferent fibers transmit responses from the CNS to the body. This division enables a structured and efficient communication network vital for both voluntary and involuntary actions.",

    "correct_answer": "The peripheral neural system is divided into two main subdivisions: the somatic neural system and the autonomic neural system. The somatic neural system is responsible for transmitting impulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles, enabling voluntary movements. The autonomic neural system, on the other hand, controls involuntary functions by transmitting impulses to smooth muscles and internal organs. The autonomic system is further subdivided into the sympathetic neural system, which prepares the body for 'fight or flight' responses, and the parasympathetic neural system, which promotes 'rest and digest' activities. Together, these subdivisions facilitate a finely tuned balance between voluntary actions and automatic physiological processes.",
