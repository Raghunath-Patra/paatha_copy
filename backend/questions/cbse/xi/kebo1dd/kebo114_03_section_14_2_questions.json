    "correct_answer": "When the diaphragm contracts and the external intercostal muscles engage during inspiration, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases. This increase in volume leads to a decrease in the intra-pulmonary pressure below the atmospheric pressure. As a result, a pressure gradient is established that forces air from the atmosphere into the lungs.",
