    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Open vascular bundles, found in dicotyledonous stems, contain cambium between the phloem and xylem, which allows them to produce secondary tissues (secondary xylem and phloem). In contrast, closed vascular bundles, found in monocotyledons, lack cambium, so they cannot form secondary tissues. The presence of cambium in open vascular bundles is significant as it contributes to the increase in girth of the plant, thereby supporting more robust growth and secondary development.",
    "explanation": "The explanation highlights the key structural differences between open and closed vascular bundles. Understanding these differences helps in evaluating how plants adapt their vascular architecture for growth, reinforcing the importance of cambium in secondary growth.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The epidermal cells are elongated and compactly arranged to form a continuous layer, which acts as a protective barrier. Their structure, characterized by a large vacuole and minimal cytoplasm, helps maintain cell rigidity while minimizing metabolic cost. The large vacuole stores water, which is critical for maintaining turgor pressure and supporting cell structure, and the thin cytoplasm facilitates efficient nutrient and metabolite exchange. This design is optimal for protection and regulation of water loss through the cuticle.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Parenchymatous cells are versatile and form the bulk of ground tissue. In the cortex and pith, they provide support, storage, and assist in photosynthesis indirectly. In leaves, parenchyma differentiates into mesophyll, where the cells are thin-walled and contain chloroplasts, directly engaging in photosynthesis. Their function varies with location: in the stem and root, they play more in storage and structural support, while in leaves, they primarily facilitate the process of photosynthesis.",
