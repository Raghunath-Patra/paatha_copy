They rely on the hostâ€™s cellular machinery for replication and metabolism, further justifying their exclusion from traditional classification systems.",

    "correct_answer": "Rod-shaped viruses possess a helical capsid structure composed of repeating protein subunits that encase their RNA genome, which facilitates a uniform and stable structure for infection. In bacteriophages, the head containing the DNA is linked to a contractile sheath and tail fibers. The tail fibers attach to the bacterial host, the sheath contracts to inject the DNA into the cell, and the head safeguards the genetic material. This detailed structural arrangement directly supports their infective strategy, ensuring efficient host penetration and replication.",

    "correct_answer": "Prions are misfolded proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Unlike viruses and viroids, which contain nucleic acids necessary for replication, prions propagate by inducing normal proteins to adopt their abnormal configuration. This unique mode of transmission results in progressive and incurable neurological conditions, posing significant challenges for diagnosis and treatment. Their effect on human health is severe because improper protein folding disrupts normal cellular functions in the nervous system, differentiating them from other acellular agents that rely on genetic material.",
