    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Food is captured by the bilobed tongue and enters the mouth into the buccal cavity, then passes into the oesophagus and reaches the stomach. The stomach secretes gastric juices for digestion, and partially digested food (chyme) moves into the duodenum where it mixes with bile and pancreatic juices. Final digestion and absorption occur in the intestine through the action of villi and microvilli. The undigested solid waste is then passed into the rectum and eliminated through the cloaca.",
    "explanation": "The frog's digestive system is designed for a carnivorous diet, which is why the alimentary canal is relatively short. Each part of the system plays a crucial role in breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Frogs have a well-developed closed circulatory system with a three-chambered heart consisting of two atria and one ventricle. The sinus venosus receives blood via the vena cava and directs it to the right atrium. Blood then enters the ventricle, which pumps it into the conus arteriosus and then to the arterial system. In addition, frogs possess special venous connections such as the hepatic portal system and renal portal system. The blood itself comprises plasma, nucleated red blood cells (erythrocytes) containing haemoglobin, white blood cells, and platelets. The system ensures that nutrients, gases, and water are efficiently transported to different parts of the body.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In aquatic environments, frogs primarily rely on cutaneous respiration where the moist skin facilitates diffusion of oxygen directly from water into the bloodstream. In terrestrial settings, frogs use pulmonary respiration where air is drawn through the nostrils into the buccal cavity and then into the lungs. Additionally, during periods of aestivation and hibernation, gas exchange may also occur through the skin. The dual respiratory methods reflect adaptations that allow frogs to effectively manage oxygen intake in both water and on land.",
