    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Alternation of generations in bryophytes involves a dominant haploid gametophyte stage that produces gametes via sexual reproduction, leading to the formation of a zygote, which then develops into a diploid sporophyte. In liverworts like Marchantia, the sporophyte is differentiated into foot, seta, and capsule, while in mosses like Funaria, the sporophyte is more elaborate and remains attached to the gametophyte. This alternation allows for genetic diversity and adaptation through both sexual and asexual means.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Bryophytes, particularly mosses, play a crucial role in initiating plant succession by colonizing bare substrates such as rocks and soil. Their dense mats reduce the impact of falling rain, thereby preventing soil erosion. Additionally, their ability to hold moisture and decompose substrates contributes to the formation of a hospitable environment for the growth of higher plants. This process not only stabilizes the soil but also enhances biodiversity by creating microhabitats.",
    "explanation": "By breaking down rocks and forming soil, bryophytes serve as pioneer species that prepare the land for subsequent colonization by more complex plants. Their structural properties reduce erosion and help maintain ecological balance in various environments.",
