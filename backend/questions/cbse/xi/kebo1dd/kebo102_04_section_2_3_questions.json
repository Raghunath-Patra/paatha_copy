    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Spore production is critical for the reproduction and dispersal of fungi. Fruiting bodies are specialized structures that produce and release spores; asexual spores (such as conidia, sporangiospores, and zoospores) allow for rapid propagation, while sexual spores (such as ascospores, basidiospores, and oospores) result from genetic recombination during sexual reproduction, ensuring genetic diversity.",

Septate hyphae contain divisions (septa) that compartmentalize the hyphae, which may help localize damage and regulate cellular functions. Both types contribute to the efficient spread and adaptability of the fungus in various environments.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Fungi play vital ecological roles. As saprophytes, they decompose dead organic matter (e.g., Penicillium), recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. As parasites, some fungi cause diseases in plants and animals (e.g., wheat rust caused by Puccinia), while as symbionts, they form beneficial relationships like lichens with algae or mycorrhizae with plant roots, enhancing nutrient uptake. Each role is crucial for ecosystem balance and nutrient cycling.",
