    "explanation": "The diagram must show the basic repeating unit of a muscle fibre – the sarcomere – and highlight the location and arrangement of actin (thin filaments) and myosin (thick filaments) that results in the striated appearance of skeletal muscle. Labels such as Z line, I band, A band, H zone, and M line are essential components based on the chapter content.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sliding filament theory states that muscle contraction occurs by the sliding of thin (actin) filaments over thick (myosin) filaments, resulting in the shortening of the sarcomere without any change in the length of the individual filaments.",
    "explanation": "This definition captures the essence of the sliding filament model where the interaction between actin and myosin causes the sarcomere to contract. It includes the relevant proteins and the concept that the filaments slide past each other during contraction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The key steps include: (1) A neural signal from the CNS reaches the neuromuscular junction, releasing acetylcholine which generates an action potential; (2) The signal spreads along the sarcolemma and causes the release of Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; (3) Ca++ binds to troponin on the thin filament, unmasking the binding sites for myosin; (4) Myosin heads (using ATP) bind to actin to form cross-bridges and perform a pivoting action (power stroke) that slides the actin filaments towards the center of the A band; (5) ADP and phosphate are released, and a new ATP binds to myosin causing the detachment and re-cocking of the myosin head, readying it for another cycle.",
    "explanation": "The answer should include the sequence of events from the arrival of the neural signal, Ca++ release, cross-bridge formation, power stroke, and the subsequent release of ADP and binding of a new ATP which resets the contraction cycle. This series of events underlies the sliding filament mechanism described in the chapter.",

    "correct_answer": "a) Actin (thin filament) is a globular, polymerized protein that forms long filaments involved in muscle contraction, while Myosin (thick filament) has a globular head with ATPase activity responsible for binding and pulling actin filaments. b) Red muscles have a high myoglobin content and numerous mitochondria, enabling aerobic metabolism and endurance, whereas White muscles have less myoglobin and fewer mitochondria, relying primarily on anaerobic metabolism for short bursts of activity. c) The pectoral girdle, consisting of the clavicle and scapula, attaches the upper limb to the axial skeleton and allows a wide range of movements, whereas the pelvic girdle is formed by the two coxal bones (each made from the fusion of ilium, ischium, and pubis) and provides support and stability for the lower limbs.",
