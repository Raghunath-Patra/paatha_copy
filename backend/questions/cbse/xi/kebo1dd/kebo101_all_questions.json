    "correct_answer": "Classifying organisms into taxa helps in organizing related organisms into hierarchical categories, which simplifies identification, highlights shared characteristics, and reveals evolutionary relationships. It allows scientists to understand similarities and differences among various groups, such as animals, mammals, and dogs.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Characterization involves describing the observable features of an organism. Identification is the process of matching an organism to an already described one. Classification groups organisms into convenient categories (taxa) based on shared characteristics, while nomenclature provides a standard naming system. Together, these processes build taxonomy, a systematic framework for studying and understanding the diversity of life by organizing and describing both similarities and differences among organisms.",
    "explanation": "This long answer requires an integrated explanation of all four processes, illustrating how they contribute to the organized study of organisms. By linking observable characteristics to a standard naming system and hierarchical groupings, taxonomy enables consistent and clear scientific communication.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Linnaeus's binomial nomenclature provided a simple, standardized, and universally accepted system that reduced confusion and facilitated global scientific communication. Its advantages include clarity, brevity, and a systematic way to categorize organisms. However, limitations include challenges in accommodating the vast diversity of life, potential misclassifications due to reliance on observable characteristics without genetic data, and difficulties when species undergo reclassification. Despite these challenges, the system remains foundational for modern taxonomy.",
    "explanation": "This answer requires a critical evaluation that discusses both the strengths of binomial nomenclature, such as international standardization and ease of use, as well as its limitations, including issues with classification in light of new genetic information.",
