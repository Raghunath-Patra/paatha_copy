Peptide hormones bind to membrane-bound receptors, generating second messengers that activate intracellular enzymes and pathways, thereby modulating metabolism. In contrast, steroid hormones cross the membrane and bind to intracellular receptors, influencing gene expression by interacting directly with DNA, which leads to protein synthesis and long-term regulatory effects on metabolism. This dual mechanism ensures precise control over physiological processes.",
