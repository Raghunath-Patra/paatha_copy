    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "Double circulation refers to the separation of the circulatory pathway into two distinct circuits: one circuit carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) and the other circuit carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body (systemic circulation). Its significance lies in allowing efficient oxygenation of blood and ensuring that oxygen-rich blood is delivered separately to the tissues, thereby maximizing the efficiency of nutrient and gas exchange.",
    "explanation": "By separating the flow of blood into pulmonary and systemic circuits, the heart ensures that deoxygenated and oxygenated blood do not mix, which increases the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs and the delivery of oxygen to tissues. This separation is critical for maintaining high metabolic activity in organs.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) Blood is a fluid connective tissue that contains plasma, cells, and clotting factors, whereas lymph is derived from the interstitial fluid, lacking most formed elements and clotting factors. (b) In an open circulatory system, blood flows freely into body cavities (sinuses) and is not confined entirely within vessels, while in a closed system, blood is contained within a network of vessels. (c) Systole is the phase of the cardiac cycle during which the heart muscles contract and pump blood out of the chambers, while diastole is the relaxation phase when the heart chambers fill with blood. (d) The P-wave of an ECG represents the depolarization (excitation) of the atria, whereas the T-wave represents the repolarization (return to resting state) of the ventricles.",
    "explanation": "Each part of the question requires comparing two related concepts. The answer clearly differentiates between blood and lymph by composition and function, distinguishes between the open and closed circulatory systems based on the confinement of blood, contrasts systole and diastole based on the phases of heart activity, and explains the distinct features of ECG segments (P-wave vs. T-wave).",

    "correct_answer": "The atrio-ventricular (AV) node and AV bundle are critical for the proper conduction and timing of electrical impulses. The AV node delays the impulse from the atria, allowing the ventricles enough time to fill with blood, while the AV bundle transmits the impulse through the ventricular septum to ensure that the ventricular contraction occurs in a coordinated manner.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The cardiac cycle begins with joint diastole, where both atria and ventricles are relaxed. Blood flows from the veins into the atria, and subsequently into the ventricles. The sinoatrial node fires, causing atrial systole, which boosts ventricular filling. The impulse then reaches the ventricles through the atrioventricular node and bundle, leading to ventricular systole. As the ventricles contract, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves close to prevent backflow, and increasing pressure opens the semilunar valves allowing blood to enter the pulmonary artery and aorta. After ejection, the ventricles relax (ventricular diastole), leading to closure of the semilunar valves. Finally, the pressure difference reopens the atrioventricular valves, allowing blood to refill the chambers, and the cycle starts anew.",
