    "correct_answer": "Alternation of generation is the alternation between the haploid gametophytic phase and the diploid sporophytic phase in plants. The lengths of these phases can vary significantly among different groups; in some plants, the gametophyte is a free-living entity, while in others it is reduced and dependent on the sporophyte, affecting the overall development and reproductive strategies of the plant.",

    "correct_answer": "Partially heterotrophic plants, such as insectivorous and parasitic plants, differ from typical autotrophic plants by obtaining additional nutrients from external organic sources. This adaptation enables them to survive in environments where nutrients are scarce or competition is high. Ecologically, these strategies contribute to biodiversity and enable plants to colonize challenging habitats, thereby influencing nutrient cycles and ecosystem dynamics.",
