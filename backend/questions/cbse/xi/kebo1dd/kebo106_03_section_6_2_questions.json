    "correct_answer": "Dicot stems typically exhibit a ring arrangement of vascular bundles that are conjoint and open, with distinct regions such as the cortex (including hypodermis, parenchyma, and endodermis) and a prominent pith. In contrast, monocot stems lack a clearly defined pith or cortex; their vascular bundles are scattered throughout the ground tissue and are generally surrounded by a sclerenchymatous hypodermis. This difference reflects the presence of secondary growth in dicots versus its absence in monocots.",

    "correct_answer": "In dorsiventral leaves, the mesophyll is the photosynthetic tissue located between the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) epidermis. It is differentiated into two types: the palisade parenchyma, which consists of elongated, closely packed cells optimized for light absorption, and the spongy parenchyma, which has loosely arranged, rounded cells with air spaces for efficient gas exchange.
