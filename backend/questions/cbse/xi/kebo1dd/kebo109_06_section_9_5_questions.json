    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Cellulose is a homopolymer consisting solely of glucose and forms long, unbranched chains which provide strength to plant cell walls. Starch, found in plants, exists as a combination of amylose (a helical, mostly unbranched structure) and amylopectin (a branched structure) and serves as an energy reserve. Glycogen, present in animals, is similar to amylopectin but with an even higher degree of branching, facilitating rapid mobilization of glucose.",
    "explanation": "The structural differences among these polysaccharides dictate their functional roles. Cellulose's unbranched structure lends rigidity, starch's mixture provides a balance between compact storage and energy accessibility, and glycogen's extensive branching enables quick glucose release.",
