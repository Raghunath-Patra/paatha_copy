    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Open growth in plants refers to the indeterminate or determinate nature of growth, meaning that growth can continue indefinitely or cease at a predetermined stage. Open differentiation means that even cells originating from the same meristem can develop into structure with different functions depending on their location within the plant. Positional information is crucial; for instance, cells closer to the root apical meristem may form root-cap cells, whereas peripheral cells might become epidermal cells. This demonstrates how growth and differentiation in plants are dynamic and influenced by spatial cues.",

    "correct_answer": "Dedifferentiation allows fully differentiated cells to regain their ability to divide, which is essential in plant tissue culture as it enables the formation of a callus, a mass of unorganized cells. Redifferentiation then drives these cells to mature into specialized forms, enabling the regeneration of complete plants.
