    "correct_answer": "The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) plays a vital role in regulating kidney function by sensing changes in blood flow and GFR. On detecting a drop in GFR, the JGA releases renin, which initiates mechanisms to increase blood flow and restore GFR. This regulation is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and ensuring that the kidneys efficiently filter blood without losing essential substances.",
    "explanation": "The JGA acts as a feedback system that monitors renal blood flow and GFR by releasing renin when necessary. This response helps adjust the glomerular blood flow and stabilize GFR, underscoring the importance of the JGA in kidney function.",
