    "correct_answer": "Vital capacity is the maximum volume of air that can be exhaled after a maximum inhalation. It is calculated as the sum of the tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), and expiratory reserve volume (ERV). Its significance lies in indicating the lung's capacity to move air, which is important for diagnosing respiratory health and identifying any pulmonary disorders.",
    "explanation": "Vital capacity reflects the efficiency of the lungs to take in and expel air. It is used clinically to assess lung function and can help in diagnosing conditions that affect breathing.",

    "explanation": "After a normal expiration, the lungs do not completely empty. The remaining air (FRC) is important as it prevents lung collapse and maintains gas exchange between breaths. The FRC is derived from the combination of ERV and RV.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "Diffusion of gases occurs primarily in the alveolar region because alveoli provide a large surface area, have extremely thin walls (made up of squamous epithelium), and are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, which are ideal conditions for efficient gas exchange.",
    "explanation": "The alveolar structure is specialized for gas exchange. The thin barrier between air in the alveoli and blood in the capillaries minimizes the diffusion distance, while a huge surface area maximizes the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.",

    "correct_answer": "CO2 is transported in the blood by three main mechanisms: approximately 20-25% is carried bound to hemoglobin as carbaminohaemoglobin, about 70% is transported in the form of bicarbonate ions (HCO3–) in the plasma, and roughly 7% is dissolved directly in the plasma.",
    "explanation": "The majority of CO2 is converted to bicarbonate by the action of carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells, which facilitates the removal of CO2 from tissues. A smaller portion attaches directly to hemoglobin, and only a minimal amount is carried dissolved in plasma.",

These actions increase the volume of the thoracic cavity, which in turn increases the pulmonary volume. This expansion lowers the intra-pulmonary pressure below the atmospheric pressure, drawing air into the lungs.",
    "explanation": "The increase in thoracic volume creates a negative pressure in the lungs compared to the outside atmosphere. This pressure gradient causes air to flow into the lungs, ensuring that fresh oxygen is brought in for gas exchange.",

Additionally, chemoreceptors located near these centers and in the aortic arch and carotid body monitor changes in CO2, H+ concentrations, and, to a lesser extent, oxygen levels, sending signals to adjust the respiratory rate accordingly.",
    "explanation": "The neural regulation of respiration ensures that the breathing rate adapts to the metabolic demands of the body. Chemoreceptors detect deviations in blood gas levels and relay this information to the brainstem centers, which then modify the rhythm and depth of breathing.",

    "correct_answer": "An increase in pCO2 decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen (a rightward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve), thereby promoting the release of oxygen to the tissues. Conversely, a decrease in pCO2 increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, facilitating oxygen uptake in the lungs.",
    "explanation": "This phenomenon, known as the Bohr effect, allows for more oxygen to be unloaded in tissues where CO2 (and H+) levels are high, and for oxygen to be bound more readily in the lungs where CO2 is lower.",

To compensate, the body increases the rate and depth of breathing (hyperventilation) to enhance oxygen uptake. Over time, physiological adjustments such as increased red blood cell production may occur to improve oxygen delivery to tissues.",

    "correct_answer": "The oxygen dissociation curve is a graph that plots the percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen against the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2). Its sigmoidal shape is due to the cooperative binding of oxygen molecules to hemoglobin, meaning that the binding of one oxygen molecule increases the affinity for the next oxygen molecule.",
    "explanation": "The curve's sigmoidal pattern allows for efficient oxygen uptake in the high pO2 environment of the lungs and facilitates oxygen release in tissues where pO2 is lower. This cooperative binding is essential for effective oxygen delivery throughout the body.",

    "correct_answer": "The lungs are situated in the thoracic cavity, which is bounded dorsally by the vertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs, and inferiorly by the diaphragm. Any change in the volume of the thoracic cavity, such as during contraction or relaxation of the diaphragm, directly affects the pulmonary cavity by changing its volume, thereby facilitating breathing.",
    "explanation": "The thoracic cavity is essentially airtight. When the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, leading to a decrease in pressure and drawing air into the lungs. Conversely, when the diaphragm relaxes, the cavity’s volume decreases, increasing the pressure and expelling air.",

These differences create directional gradients that facilitate efficient gas exchange at both sites.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the varying partial pressures at each site.

    "correct_answer": "Carbon dioxide is 20-25 times more soluble than oxygen, meaning that even a small difference in its partial pressure can result in a large amount of CO2 diffusing per unit time. In contrast, oxygen’s lower solubility requires a greater partial pressure difference to drive its diffusion at a similar rate. This difference in solubility underpins the efficiency of CO2 removal from the blood even when partial pressure gradients are not extremely steep.",
