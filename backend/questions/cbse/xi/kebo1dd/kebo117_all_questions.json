    "correct_answer": "The key steps include: (1) A neural signal from the CNS reaches the neuromuscular junction, releasing acetylcholine which generates an action potential; (2) The signal spreads along the sarcolemma and causes the release of Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; (3) Ca++ binds to troponin on the thin filament, unmasking the binding sites for myosin; (4) Myosin heads (using ATP) bind to actin to form cross-bridges and perform a pivoting action (power stroke) that slides the actin filaments towards the center of the A band; (5) ADP and phosphate are released, and a new ATP binds to myosin causing the detachment and re-cocking of the myosin head, readying it for another cycle.",
    "explanation": "The answer should include the sequence of events from the arrival of the neural signal, Ca++ release, cross-bridge formation, power stroke, and the subsequent release of ADP and binding of a new ATP which resets the contraction cycle.

Cartilaginous joints use cartilage to connect bones, permitting limited movement, such as between the vertebrae. Synovial joints have a fluid-filled cavity that dramatically increases movement range, exemplified by the knee, shoulder (ball and socket), and pivot joints. The structural differences directly relate to the extent of movability offered by each type.",
