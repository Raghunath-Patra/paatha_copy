    "correct_answer": "Characterization involves describing the observable features of an organism. Identification is the process of matching an organism to an already described one.

    "correct_answer": "Linnaeus's binomial nomenclature provided a simple, standardized, and universally accepted system that reduced confusion and facilitated global scientific communication. Its advantages include clarity, brevity, and a systematic way to categorize organisms. However, limitations include challenges in accommodating the vast diversity of life, potential misclassifications due to reliance on observable characteristics without genetic data, and difficulties when species undergo reclassification. Despite these challenges, the system remains foundational for modern taxonomy.",
