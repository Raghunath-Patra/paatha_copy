    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The sliding filament theory explains that muscle contraction occurs when thin actin filaments slide over thick myosin filaments, shortening the sarcomere. This is triggered by a neural stimulus that releases calcium ions, which binds to troponin, unblocking the active sites on actin. Myosin heads then bind to these sites forming cross-bridges. The subsequent power stroke rotates the myosin heads, pulling the actin filaments inward. ATP binding causes the detachment of myosin, and its subsequent hydrolysis resets the head for another cycle of contraction.",
    "explanation": "This theory describes the molecular mechanism of muscle contraction by demonstrating how the interaction between actin and myosin, powered by ATP, results in the sliding of filaments and consequent sarcomere shortening.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A skeletal muscle is organized into muscle bundles called fascicles that are held together by fascia. Each fascicle is composed of numerous muscle fibres, which are multinucleated cells enclosed by the sarcolemma. Within each muscle fibre, the myofibrils are made up of repeating units called sarcomeresâ€”the functional units of contraction. The sarcomere contains overlapping thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments arranged between Z lines. During contraction, the sliding of actin over myosin shortens the sarcomere and thus the muscle fibre.",
    "explanation": "This detailed structure is essential for efficient muscle contraction as the organization from fascia down to the molecular interaction within the sarcomere ensures coordinated force generation.",

Visceral (smooth) muscles are non-striated, found in the inner walls of hollow organs, and are controlled involuntarily to carry out functions such as food movement. Cardiac muscles, which make up the heart, are striated like skeletal muscles but operate involuntarily to pump blood, featuring a branching structure that supports coordinated contractions.",
