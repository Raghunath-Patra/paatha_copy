Cartilaginous joints use cartilage to connect bones, permitting limited movement, such as between the vertebrae. Synovial joints have a fluid-filled cavity that dramatically increases movement range, exemplified by the knee, shoulder (ball and socket), and pivot joints. The structural differences directly relate to the extent of movability offered by each type.",
