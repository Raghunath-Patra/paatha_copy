    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The neural system regulates respiratory rhythm primarily through the respiratory rhythm centre located in the medulla, which generates the basic rhythm of breathing. The pneumotaxic centre in the pons modulates this rhythm by shortening the inspiration phase. In addition, a chemosensitive area that is highly responsive to increases in CO2 and hydrogen ion concentrations plays a crucial role by signaling the respiratory rhythm centre to adjust breathing accordingly. Receptors in the aortic arch and carotid artery also detect these changes and contribute to the overall regulation.",
    "explanation": "The neural regulation involves multiple centres: the medulla-based respiratory rhythm centre generates the basic rhythm; the pons-based pneumotaxic centre modulates the period of inspiration; and the chemosensitive area plus peripheral receptors monitor chemical changes, ensuring that the respiratory rate meets the body's demands.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When blood CO2 levels rise, the chemosensitive area near the respiratory rhythm centre is activated and sends signals to increase the rate of respiration. Simultaneously, the pneumotaxic centre in the pons fine-tunes the breathing pattern by reducing the duration of inspiration, thereby helping to eliminate excess CO2 efficiently. This integrated action ensures that the respiratory rhythm is adjusted dynamically according to the bodyâ€™s metabolic demands.",
    "explanation": "The interaction involves immediate chemical feedback via the chemosensitive area and modulation of inspiration duration via the pneumotaxic centre. Together, these mechanisms maintain homeostasis by adapting the respiratory rate in sync with the detected CO2 levels.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Oxygen's role is considered insignificant in respiratory rhythm regulation because the control mechanism relies heavily on the detection of CO2 and H+ levels. The chemosensitive area is highly responsive to changes in CO2 and H+ concentrations, which are critical indicators of metabolic activity. Oxygen levels do not directly influence the neural centres responsible for respiratory rhythm, as their primary function is to maintain acid-base balance and manage CO2 elimination.",
    "explanation": "The respiratory regulation system focuses on removing CO2 and correcting pH imbalances rather than monitoring oxygen concentration. Thus, oxygen plays a lesser role, making CO2 and H+ the main drivers of respiratory adjustments.",
