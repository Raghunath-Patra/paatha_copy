    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the alveoli, the partial pressure of O2 is high and that of CO2 is low compared to the blood, driving oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out. In contrast, in the systemic tissues, the partial pressure of O2 is low and CO2 is relatively high, resulting in the diffusion of O2 into tissues and CO2 into the blood. These differences create directional gradients that facilitate efficient gas exchange at both sites.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the varying partial pressures at each site. In the lungs, alveolar air has high O2 and low CO2, favoring oxygen uptake and CO2 elimination; in the tissues, the opposite gradient ensures that oxygen reaches cells while CO2 is collected for removal. This contrast is central to efficient respiratory gas exchange.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Carbon dioxide is 20-25 times more soluble than oxygen, meaning that even a small difference in its partial pressure can result in a large amount of CO2 diffusing per unit time. In contrast, oxygenâ€™s lower solubility requires a greater partial pressure difference to drive its diffusion at a similar rate. This difference in solubility underpins the efficiency of CO2 removal from the blood even when partial pressure gradients are not extremely steep.",
    "explanation": "The higher solubility of CO2 means that it can be released and absorbed more quickly, ensuring that CO2 produced by the tissues is efficiently removed despite its lower partial pressure gradient compared with oxygen.
