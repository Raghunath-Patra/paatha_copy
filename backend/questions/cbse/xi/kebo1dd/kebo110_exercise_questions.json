    "correct_answer": "Karyokinesis is the division of the nucleus which involves the separation of chromosomes, while cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm resulting in the formation of two separate daughter cells.",
    "explanation": "Karyokinesis involves the segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter nuclei during mitosis, whereas cytokinesis divides the cell's cytoplasm and organelles between the two emerging cells. Both processes are essential for complete cell division.",

    "correct_answer": "Interphase consists of three phases: G1 phase, where the cell grows and remains metabolically active; S phase, where DNA is replicated (doubling the DNA content from 2C to 4C without changing chromosome number); and G2 phase, where the cell continues to grow and synthesizes proteins needed for mitosis.",
    "explanation": "During interphase, a cell prepares for division by growing and replicating its DNA. Although cell growth is continuous, DNA replication is confined to the S phase. G1 and G2 are periods of metabolic activity and protein synthesis to support the upcoming mitosis.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Mitosis is called equational division because it results in daughter cells that have the same number and type of chromosomes as the parent cell.",
    "explanation": "During mitosis, replicated chromosomes are evenly divided between two daughter nuclei so that each new cell mirrors the genetic information of the original cell. There is no change in the number of chromosomes, hence the term equational.",

    "correct_answer": "Synapsis is the process during meiosis in which homologous chromosomes pair up; a bivalent (or tetrad) is the structure formed by the paired homologous chromosomes, consisting of four chromatids; and chiasmata are the visible X-shaped regions where crossing over has occurred between them.",
    "explanation": "Synapsis enables crossing over and genetic recombination. The bivalent is essential for proper alignment and segregation during meiosis, and chiasmata indicate the physical exchange points between non-sister chromatids.

    "explanation": "Animal cells have flexible membranes that allow a contractile ring to form and create a furrow, while plant cells with their rigid cell walls form a cell plate from vesicles that fuse at the center of the cell to form a new cell wall.",

Additionally, mitosis is used for growth and repair and occurs in somatic cells, whereas meiosis occurs in the production of gametes.",
    "explanation": "The answer should highlight that mitosis maintains the chromosome number and produces identical cells, whereas meiosis reduces the chromosome number to half and promotes genetic diversity through recombination and segregation of homologous chromosomes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Throughout the cell cycle, the number of chromosomes in a diploid cell remains constant (e.g., 2n), but the DNA content doubles during the S phase from 2C to 4C and is then equally divided between the daughter cells during mitosis to restore the 2C state. In meiosis, similar replication occurs, but the reduction division results in haploid cells with half the number of chromosomes.",
    "explanation": "Despite DNA replication during S phase doubling the DNA content, the actual number of chromosomes stays the same until they are segregated. After mitosis, the chromosome number is maintained while the DNA content resets. In meiosis, additional steps lead to halved chromosome numbers in gametes.",
