For instance, the human heart, with its four types of tissues, is more complex than simpler pump-like structures found in some simpler organisms. However, this trend does not imply that evolution always results in increased complexity, but rather that complexity can be a beneficial adaptation in certain environments.",

    "correct_answer": "A proposed model could involve a comprehensive study combining dissection, imaging techniques, and histological analysis. First, external morphology would be documented by photographing and mapping the external features of frogs. Then, internal anatomy would be explored via dissection and microscopy to identify tissue types and organ arrangements. This model would allow comparison with other vertebrates, thereby highlighting evolutionary adaptations and trends in organ system organization. Such an integrated approach not only advances our understanding of vertebrate structure but also sheds light on evolutionary processes that govern form and function.",
