    "correct_answer": "Prolonged exposure to industrial dust overwhelms the body’s defense system, leading to continuous irritation of the lung tissues. This irritation causes inflammation, and over an extended period, the inflammatory response leads to the proliferation of fibrous tissues, a process known as fibrosis. Fibrosis reduces lung elasticity and interferes with the normal gas exchange process, ultimately leading to serious lung damage.",

In contrast, emphysema is characterized by the irreversible damage to the alveolar walls, which reduces the respiratory surface area and affects gas exchange. While asthma is mainly a disease of the airways with episodic symptoms, emphysema results in a progressive decline in lung function.",
