Their coordinated actions allow for regulated gene expression and the production of proteins essential for cell structure and function.",

Both cell types have a nucleus and cytoplasm, but the additional structures in plant cells are adapted for a fixed, energy-producing lifestyle, whereas animal cells are more variable in shape and support motility and dynamic processes.",
    "explanation": "This comparison emphasizes the distinct cell structures that are adapted to the specific needs of plants and animals. The cell wall and chloroplasts in plant cells contribute to structural integrity and energy production, whereas animal cells utilize other specialized structures like centrosomes to handle dynamic functions like cell division.",
