    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Classification systems have evolved from simple two-kingdom systems (plants and animals) to more complex systems that include additional kingdoms such as Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. Advances in microscopy, biochemical studies, and molecular genetics have driven these changes, leading to further subdivisions and reclassifications, including the recognition of acellular entities like viruses, viroids, prions, and lichens.",
    "explanation": "Over time, the discovery of new organisms and advancements in scientific techniques have necessitated changes in classification. This process reflects deeper understanding of the diversity of life, resulting in the addition or reassignment of various groups. The evolution of classification systems illustrates the historical progression of biological knowledge and methods.",

    "correct_answer": "For heterotrophic bacteria, they are used in the production of curd and antibiotics. For archaebacteria, they are used in the production of methane from animal dung, which can be harnessed as biogas.",
    "explanation": "Heterotrophic bacteria play important roles in food processing (like curd formation) and in pharmaceutical industries (antibiotic production). Archaebacteria, particularly methanogens found in the gut of ruminants, are significant for their role in methane production, which has economic importance in energy generation.",

    "correct_answer": "An algal bloom refers to the rapid multiplication of algae in aquatic environments, often due to excess nutrients, while red tides are specific algal blooms, typically caused by dinoflagellates, that discolor the water red and may produce toxins harmful to marine life.",
    "explanation": "Algal blooms denote overgrowth of algae which can deplete oxygen and harm aquatic life. Red tides, a type of harmful algal bloom, are caused by specific algae, notably dinoflagellates, that produce toxins resulting in large-scale fish kills and environmental problems.",

    "correct_answer": "Viroids are composed solely of a small circular RNA molecule and lack a protein coat, whereas viruses consist of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) enclosed within a protein coat called a capsid.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the structure: viruses have both protein and genetic material, while viroids are much simpler, consisting only of RNA. This structural difference accounts for their differing behavior and pathogenicity.",

    "correct_answer": "The four major groups of Protozoa are: 1) Amoeboid protozoans, which move by pseudopodia and include amoebae; 2) Flagellated protozoans, which move using flagella and include organisms like Trypanosoma; 3) Ciliated protozoans, which have rows of cilia for movement and feeding, exemplified by Paramecium; 4) Sporozoans, which have an infectious spore stage, with Plasmodium as a notable member.",
    "explanation": "Protozoans are diverse and categorized based on their locomotion and feeding mechanisms. Amoeboid protozoans use pseudopodia, flagellated ones use one or more flagella, ciliated types utilize coordinated ciliary motion for feeding, and sporozoans are identified by their spore-like stage in the life cycle.",

    "explanation": "While most plants are autotrophic, some have evolved to supplement their energy needs by obtaining nutrients from other organisms. Insectivorous plants capture insects for nutrients, and parasitic plants like Cuscuta derive nutrients directly from host plants.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Phycomycetes are typically aquatic or found on decaying matter; they have aseptate, coenocytic mycelium and reproduce asexually via zoospores or aplanospores, as well as sexually by forming zygospores. Ascomycetes, or sac-fungi, have septate and branched mycelium and reproduce asexually through conidia produced on conidiophores; sexually, they form ascospores within sac-like asci organized in ascocarps. Basidiomycetes have septate mycelium as well and primarily reproduce sexually, forming basidiospores on basidia that are arranged in basidiocarps; vegetative reproduction can also occur. Deuteromycetes, known as imperfect fungi, are classified based on their asexual reproduction via conidia, as their sexual stages are not observed.",
    "explanation": "The classes of fungi are distinguished by the characteristics of their mycelium and reproductive structures. Phycomycetes exhibit simple, often coenocytic hyphae and have both asexual and sexual reproductive methods. Ascomycetes are known for their sac-like asci and organized fruiting bodies, while basidiomycetes form distinct basidia on structured fruiting bodies like mushrooms. Deuteromycetes are grouped based on the absence of known sexual stages, which are later reclassified once discovered.",

    "correct_answer": "Euglenoids are primarily freshwater organisms with a flexible pellicle instead of a rigid cell wall, possess two flagella (one short and one long), and are photosynthetic in the presence of light but can become heterotrophic in its absence. Their pigments are similar to those of higher plants.",
    "explanation": "Euglenoids have a unique structure featuring a pellicle which allows flexibility, and their dual mode of nutrition (photosynthetic under light; heterotrophic when dark) distinguishes them. Their flagella support movement, and the similarity of their pigments to those in plants is notable for classification purposes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "Viruses are non-cellular infectious agents that consist of a nucleic acid (either RNA or DNA, but never both) enclosed in a protein coat called a capsid, which is made up of capsomeres arranged in helical or polyhedral forms. They are inert outside a host cell and require the host’s machinery for replication. Common viral diseases include mumps, smallpox, herpes, and influenza (with AIDS also caused by a virus).",
    "explanation": "The structural simplicity of viruses, comprising genetic material and a protective capsid, is central to their mode of infection and replication. They cannot independently perform metabolic functions, making them obligate parasites. The identification of several common diseases caused by viruses underscores their medical significance.",
