Enzymes have an optimum temperature and pH at which their activity is maximal. Temperature increases reaction rates up to a point; however, if the temperature exceeds the optimum (usually around 40°C for most enzymes), the enzyme may denature and lose its function. Similarly, enzymes have an optimal pH, and deviations from this optimal value can alter the ionic bonds and structure of the enzyme, leading to reduced activity. In contrast, low temperatures may slow down the reaction without denaturing the enzyme, preserving its structure but reducing the reaction velocity.",
