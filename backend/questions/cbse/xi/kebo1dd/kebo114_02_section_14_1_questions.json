    "correct_answer": "The lungs are situated in the thoracic cavity, which is bounded dorsally by the vertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs, and inferiorly by the diaphragm. Any change in the volume of the thoracic cavity, such as during contraction or relaxation of the diaphragm, directly affects the pulmonary cavity by changing its volume, thereby facilitating breathing.",
    "explanation": "The thoracic cavity is essentially airtight. When the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, leading to a decrease in pressure and drawing air into the lungs. Conversely, when the diaphragm relaxes, the cavityâ€™s volume decreases, increasing the pressure and expelling air.",

Additionally, terrestrial mammals possess pleural membranes to reduce friction and a diaphragm to aid in ventilation.",
