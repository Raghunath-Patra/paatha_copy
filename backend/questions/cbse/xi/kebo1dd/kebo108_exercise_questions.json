    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A mesosome is a specialized infolding of the plasma membrane in prokaryotic cells. It is involved in functions such as cell wall formation, DNA replication, distribution of genetic material during cell division, and increasing the surface area for electron transport and enzymatic reactions related to respiration and secretion.",
    "explanation": "Mesosomes are unique to prokaryotes and serve multiple functions including enhancing the surface area of the plasma membrane and assisting in processes like cell division and respiration. Their structure as infoldings of the membrane supports these functions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Neutral solutes move across the plasma membrane by simple diffusion along the concentration gradient. Polar molecules, however, cannot easily pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer and are transported by carrier proteins via facilitated diffusion or by active transport mechanisms when moving against a concentration gradient.",
    "explanation": "Simple diffusion allows neutral solutes to cross the lipid bilayer without assistance, but because polar molecules are repelled by the hydrophobic interior of the membrane, they require specialized transport proteins to help them cross.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Mitochondria and Chloroplasts are two double membrane bound organelles. Mitochondria have an outer membrane and a highly folded inner membrane (cristae) that increase surface area, and they are the site of aerobic respiration and ATP production. Chloroplasts also have a double membrane; their inner membrane encloses the stroma, within which stacks of thylakoids (grana) are found, essential for photosynthesis.",
    "explanation": "Both mitochondria and chloroplasts are critical for energy conversion processes in the cell, with mitochondria generating ATP through respiration and chloroplasts carrying out photosynthesis to produce sugars.

They have a cell envelope which includes a plasma membrane and usually a cell wall, and contain naked circular DNA, sometimes with additional plasmids. Some may have structures like mesosomes and flagella.",

    "correct_answer": "Lysosomes are membrane-bound vesicles that contain hydrolytic enzymes for intracellular digestion, while vacuoles are storage organelles that hold water, sap, and waste products. Lysosomes function primarily in degradation and recycling of cellular components, whereas vacuoles are involved in storage and maintaining cell turgor.",
    "explanation": "Although both are part of the endomembrane system, lysosomes and vacuoles have distinct roles. Lysosomes break down macromolecules, while vacuoles store substances, which reflects their specialised functions in the cell.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A centromere is the primary constriction on a chromosome where two sister chromatids are held together. The position of the centromere divides the chromosome into arms and forms the basis for classification into metacentric (centromere in the middle), submetacentric (centromere slightly off center), acrocentric (centromere near one end), and telocentric (centromere at the very end) chromosomes.",
    "explanation": "The centromere is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Its location on the chromosome determines the relative lengths of the arms, which is used to classify chromosome types. A diagram typically illustrates these different positions to help visualise the classifications.",
