For fats, it involves the breakdown of fatty acids to acetyl CoA, which then enters the Krebs cycle to produce energy; conversely, acetyl CoA can be withdrawn for fatty acid synthesis when needed. For proteins, degradation of proteins into amino acids followed by deamination allows these molecules to enter the pathway at various points such as pyruvate or Krebs cycle intermediates. This illustrates how the respiratory pathway supplies intermediates used for both energy production and biosynthetic processes.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The respiratory pathway should be considered amphibolic because it serves a dual function. In the catabolic process, carbohydrates like glucose are metabolized through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to produce energy. Fats are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, with fatty acids converting to acetyl CoA, which enters the same pathway. Proteins, on the other hand, are digested to amino acids that are deaminated and incorporated at different levels of the pathway. Simultaneously, these intermediates are also used in anabolic reactions for the synthesis of fatty acids, proteins, and other vital compounds. The withdrawal and subsequent use of the same intermediates in both breakdown and synthesis clearly underline the amphibolic nature of the respiratory pathway.",
