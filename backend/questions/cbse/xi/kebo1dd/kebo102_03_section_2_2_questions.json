    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Euglenoids are photosynthetic when exposed to sunlight due to the presence of chloroplasts similar to those in higher plants; however, they can switch to a heterotrophic mode and feed on smaller organisms when sunlight is scarce. In contrast, dinoflagellates are primarily photosynthetic and rely on pigments to capture light, but they generally do not switch to a heterotrophic lifestyle as prominently as euglenoids. This difference represents an adaptation to fluctuating light environments, with euglenoids displaying metabolic flexibility.",
    "explanation": "The answer highlights that euglenoids can switch between photosynthesis and heterotrophy based on light availability, showing metabolic flexibility; while dinoflagellates are mostly dependent on photosynthesis even though they possess diverse pigments. This contrast shows varying strategies for coping with changes in light conditions.",

    "correct_answer": "Diatoms play a crucial role as primary producers in marine environments, forming the base of the food chain. Their unique cell wall structure, which consists of silica-based overlapping shells, not only provides them with protection but also leads to the accumulation of diatomaceous earth over time. This silica deposit has various practical applications, such as in polishing and filtration. The durability of their cell walls ensures that diatoms persist in the environment, continually contributing to the stability and sustainability of marine ecosystems.",

    "correct_answer": "Slime moulds serve as saprophytic organisms that decompose decaying organic material, thereby recycling nutrients in ecosystems. Their ability to form an aggregative plasmodium allows them to cover extensive areas and efficiently exploit food resources. During unfavorable conditions, the plasmodium differentiates into fruiting bodies that produce highly resistant spores capable of surviving adverse environments for extended periods. These adaptations ensure the survival and continued role of slime moulds in nutrient cycling and ecological balance.",
