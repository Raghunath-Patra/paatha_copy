    "correct_answer": "Hormones are released by endocrine glands directly into the bloodstream and travel to distant target organs, where they bind to specific receptors to elicit a response. Their production in trace amounts is crucial because small concentrations are enough to trigger significant biological responses, and precise regulation prevents over- or under-stimulation of target tissues.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The anatomical location of endocrine glands is critical because it ensures that hormones are strategically released into the bloodstream near major blood vessels, allowing rapid delivery to target organs. For example, glands in the brain (pituitary, pineal) regulate central processes like growth and circadian rhythms, while those in the neck (thyroid, parathyroid) influence metabolism. This spatial arrangement supports efficient hormonal coordination and helps diagnose related disorders.",

    "correct_answer": "The classical definition of hormones focused on chemicals produced by organized endocrine glands and released into the blood, whereas the modern definition broadens this to include any non-nutrient chemical that acts as an intercellular messenger in trace amounts. This expanded definition implies that hormonal regulation is more diverse than previously thought, incorporating additional molecules that contribute to complex signaling networks in vertebrates and simpler systems in invertebrates.
