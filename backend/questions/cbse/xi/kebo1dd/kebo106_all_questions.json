    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For roots: Dicot roots generally have a single, well-organized stele with a few, radially arranged vascular bundles (usually in a star-shaped arrangement) with a distinct endodermis and a small or inconspicuous pith. In contrast, Monocot roots typically have polyarch xylem with many vascular bundles, a larger and well-developed pith, and no secondary growth. For stems: Dicot stems show a ring arrangement of vascular bundles (conjoint, open bundles with a cambium enabling secondary growth) including distinct cortex and pith, while Monocot stems have scattered vascular bundles (conjoint, closed, often with a prominent sclerenchymatous hypodermis) without a clearly defined ring and lack secondary growth.",
    "explanation": "This question requires students to illustrate and compare the key anatomical differences. In roots, differences include the arrangement and number of vascular bundles and the relative development of the pith. In stems, the arrangement of vascular bundles (ring in dicots versus scattered in monocots) and presence or absence of secondary growth are critical points. These differences are vital in plant anatomy for distinguishing between monocots and dicots.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Examine the arrangement of vascular bundles. In a dicot stem, vascular bundles are arranged in a ring and usually have a well-developed cortex and pith with the presence of vascular cambium that supports secondary growth. In a monocot stem, vascular bundles are scattered throughout the ground tissue, are conjoint and closed, and the stem typically lacks secondary growth.",
    "explanation": "The answer focuses on the identification features. Dicots have a ring formation of vascular bundles with distinct regions of cortex, vascular tissue, and pith, and are capable of secondary growth due to the vascular cambium. Monocots display scattered vascular bundles with a different organization and no secondary growth. These features can be observed under a microscope in a transverse section.",

In some cases, subsidiary cells adjacent to the guard cells assist in enhancing the movement or function of the guard cells.",
    "explanation": "The answer should describe that the stomatal apparatus is essential for managing water loss and gas exchange (CO2 for photosynthesis and O2 release).

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Open vascular bundles, found in dicotyledonous stems, contain cambium between the phloem and xylem, which allows them to produce secondary tissues (secondary xylem and phloem). In contrast, closed vascular bundles, found in monocotyledons, lack cambium, so they cannot form secondary tissues. The presence of cambium in open vascular bundles is significant as it contributes to the increase in girth of the plant, thereby supporting more robust growth and secondary development.",
    "explanation": "The explanation highlights the key structural differences between open and closed vascular bundles. Understanding these differences helps in evaluating how plants adapt their vascular architecture for growth, reinforcing the importance of cambium in secondary growth.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The epidermal cells are elongated and compactly arranged to form a continuous layer, which acts as a protective barrier. Their structure, characterized by a large vacuole and minimal cytoplasm, helps maintain cell rigidity while minimizing metabolic cost. The large vacuole stores water, which is critical for maintaining turgor pressure and supporting cell structure, and the thin cytoplasm facilitates efficient nutrient and metabolite exchange. This design is optimal for protection and regulation of water loss through the cuticle.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Parenchymatous cells are versatile and form the bulk of ground tissue. In the cortex and pith, they provide support, storage, and assist in photosynthesis indirectly. In leaves, parenchyma differentiates into mesophyll, where the cells are thin-walled and contain chloroplasts, directly engaging in photosynthesis. Their function varies with location: in the stem and root, they play more in storage and structural support, while in leaves, they primarily facilitate the process of photosynthesis.",
