This binding often induces a conformational change in the enzyme to better fit the substrate. The enzyme then facilitates the breaking and making of bonds as the substrate is converted into the product through a transient transition state. Once the reaction is complete, the enzyme-product (EP) complex forms before finally releasing the product. Thereafter, the enzyme is free to bind with another substrate molecule and repeat the cycle.",

    "correct_answer": "Both temperature and pH significantly affect enzyme activity by influencing the enzyme's structure. Enzymes have an optimum temperature and pH at which their activity is maximal. Temperature increases reaction rates up to a point; however, if the temperature exceeds the optimum (usually around 40Â°C for most enzymes), the enzyme may denature and lose its function. Similarly, enzymes have an optimal pH, and deviations from this optimal value can alter the ionic bonds and structure of the enzyme, leading to reduced activity. In contrast, low temperatures may slow down the reaction without denaturing the enzyme, preserving its structure but reducing the reaction velocity.",
