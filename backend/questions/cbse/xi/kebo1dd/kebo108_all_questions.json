    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Matthias Schleiden observed that plants are composed of a variety of cells that form tissues, establishing the idea that cells are the basic units of life in plants. Theodore Schwann extended this observation to animals by studying animal cells and identifying the plasma membrane, hence supporting the similarity between plant and animal cells. Rudolf Virchow then refined the cell theory by proposing that new cells arise only from existing cells, encapsulated in his phrase 'Omnis cellulae ex cellulae'.",

    "correct_answer": "The cell theory has had a profound impact on modern biology by establishing that all living organisms are composed of cells, which are the fundamental structural and functional units of life. Schleiden and Schwannâ€™s observations provided the initial evidence that cells are universal components of life, while Virchowâ€™s contribution that new cells must arise from existing cells laid the foundation for understanding cell division and propagation. These ideas collectively revolutionized biological research, influencing fields such as embryology, pathology, and genetics.",

    "correct_answer": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous network of membranous tubules with two distinct regions: the rough ER, which has ribosomes attached to its surface and is involved in protein synthesis and processing, and the smooth ER, which lacks ribosomes and is primarily responsible for lipid synthesis, detoxification, and calcium storage. Both regions are connected to the nuclear envelope and are integral in transporting molecules within the cell.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Mitochondria and chloroplasts are both double membrane-bound organelles involved in energy conversion. Mitochondria generate ATP through aerobic respiration, with energy-producing processes occurring along the cristae and within the matrix. In contrast, chloroplasts capture light energy to drive photosynthesis; they have thylakoid membranes organized into grana to maximize light absorption and stroma where the Calvin cycle takes place. Although both organelles contain their own DNA and ribosomes and divide by fission, their roles in energy transformation differ significantly in terms of substrates and environmental conditions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The cytoskeleton is a network of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments that provides structural support, maintains cell shape, and enables intracellular transport. Cilia and flagella, which extend from the cell surface, contain a 9+2 arrangement of microtubules and are responsible for motility either of the cell itself or of extracellular fluids. Centrioles, found within the centrosome, play a key role in organizing microtubules during cell division and act as basal bodies for cilia and flagella formation. Together, these components integrate to support both the structural integrity and dynamic functions of eukaryotic cells.",
