    "correct_answer": "A pinnately compound leaf has leaflets arranged along both sides of a common central rachis, whereas a palmately compound leaf has leaflets that all attach at a common point at the tip of the petiole.",
    "explanation": "In a pinnately compound leaf the leaflets are arranged along a central axis, giving the appearance of a feather, while in a palmately compound leaf, the leaflets spread out like the fingers of a hand. Examples include the neem (pinnately compound) and silk cotton (palmately compound).",

    "correct_answer": "Phyllotaxy is the pattern in which leaves are arranged on a stem. The three main types are alternate (a single leaf per node arranged alternately, e.g., china rose, mustard, sunflower), opposite (two leaves per node positioned on opposite sides, e.g., Calotropis, guava), and whorled (three or more leaves per node forming a circle, e.g., Alstonia).",
    "explanation": "These patterns affect light capture and overall plant aesthetics. Alternate phyllotaxy means one leaf per node in an alternating fashion, opposite involves pairs at each node, and whorled has multiple leaves radiating from a single node. Examples provided in the chapter illustrate these distinctions.",

    "correct_answer": "Aestivation refers to the arrangement of sepals or petals in the bud; placentation is the arrangement of ovules within the ovary; actinomorphic means having radial symmetry; zygomorphic means having bilateral symmetry; a superior ovary is one that is positioned above the point of attachment of other floral parts; a perigynous flower has floral parts attached around the ovary at roughly the same level, making the ovary half-inferior; epipetalous stamen is a stamen that is attached to the petals.",
    "explanation": "Each term describes key aspects of floral morphology. Aestivation is important for bud protection, placentation relates to ovule placement, and the terms actinomorphic and zygomorphic refer to the symmetry of the flower.

An apocarpous ovary consists of multiple free carpels, while a syncarpous ovary has carpels that are fused together.",
    "explanation": "In racemose inflorescence the axis continues to grow and new flowers emerge from lateral positions in a top-to-bottom order; in cymose, the terminal flower halts the growth of the main axis.

    "correct_answer": "The arrangement of floral members is described based on their insertion relative to the ovary on the thalamus. In a hypogynous flower, the gynoecium is at the highest position with other floral parts attached below it, giving a superior ovary. In a perigynous flower, the other parts are attached around the ovary so that they are almost on the same level, resulting in a half-inferior ovary. In an epigynous flower, the floral parts arise above an inferior ovary, as the thalamus grows upward to partially or completely enclose the ovary.",
    "explanation": "The answer provides a clear explanation of how the position of the calyx, corolla, and androecium relative to the ovary determines whether a flower is hypogynous, perigynous, or epigynous.

In racemose inflorescences, the continual growth of the main axis and the acropetal arrangement of flowers can attract pollinators by providing a prolonged sequence of blooming flowers. In contrast, cymose inflorescences, with their terminal flower and basipetal order, may focus pollinator attraction towards a single, prominent bloom which can increase pollination precision. Both strategies reflect adaptations to specific ecological niches where pollinator behavior and environmental factors drive evolutionary change.",

Such modifications lead to the diversity seen in inflorescence structures like racemose and cymose types. Examples include the continuous axis growth in racemose inflorescences versus the terminal flower in cymose ones, demonstrating how slight variations in meristem activity can produce varied morphological outcomes that are adapted to different pollination strategies.",
    "explanation": "The modification of the shoot apical meristem is a critical step in the development of flowers and inflorescences.

The embryo is free within the seed. Monocotyledonous seeds, on the other hand, usually have a single cotyledon known as the scutellum, a prominent endosperm that stores food, and a seed coat that is generally fused with the fruit wall.

    "correct_answer": "The seed coat serves as the first line of defense, protecting the embryo from physical damage, pathogens, and environmental stresses. It is composed of two layers in dicots â€” the outer testa and inner tegmen â€” and in monocots, it is usually membranous and fused with the fruit wall. The hilum marks the site of attachment to the fruit and indicates where nutrients were supplied during development. The micropyle, a small pore positioned above the hilum, allows water to enter the seed during germination, thus triggering the growth processes.

The calyx consists of five united, persistent sepals that open in a valvate manner. The corolla has five united petals, also exhibiting valvate aestivation. The androecium is made up of five stamens that are epipetalous, meaning they are attached to the petals. The gynoecium comprises two carpels that are fused together (syncarpous) to form a superior, bilocular ovary with an axile placenta that is swollen with many ovules. Each of these parts plays a critical role: the sepals and petals attract pollinators or protect the developing flower, the stamens provide the pollen, and the gynoecium houses the ovules for fertilization.",

    "correct_answer": "Solanaceae plants have significant economic importance due to their diverse uses and morphological traits. For instance, the development of fleshy berries or capsules in many members of this family makes them ideal for food crops like tomato, potato, and brinjal. In addition to edibles, some species produce compounds used as spices (e.g., chilli), medicines (e.g., belladonna, ashwagandha), and even for fumigation (e.g., tobacco).
