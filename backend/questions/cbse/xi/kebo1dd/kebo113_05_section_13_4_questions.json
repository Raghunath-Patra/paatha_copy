    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Interactions among plant growth regulators are complex; auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins can work together or oppose each other depending on the developmental process. For instance, auxins maintain apical dominance while cytokinins promote lateral bud growth, and gibberellins promote stem elongation. These hormones may interact synergistically during processes such as cell division and differentiation, yet antagonistically in processes like seed dormancy and abscission.",
    "explanation": "This answer covers how multiple PGRs interact: auxins produced at the apical bud suppress lateral growth while cytokinins counteract this suppression to promote branching. Gibberellins may interact with auxins to promote elongation, and ABA can counter these promoters during stress conditions. These diverse interactions show the balance necessary for proper plant development.",

    "correct_answer": "The discovery of auxin involved experiments where Darwin and his son observed that canary grass coleoptiles bend towards light, suggesting a transmittable influence from the tip. Later, F.W. Went isolated the active substance from the tip of oat coleoptiles, which demonstrated that the tip produces a substance (auxin) responsible for initiating phototropic bending.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains that the seminal observations by Darwin and his son about coleoptile bending led to the hypothesis that the tip generates a signal. F.W.
