    "correct_answer": "The absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a shows peaks in the blue and red regions, where the pigment absorbs light most efficiently. Correspondingly, the action spectrum of photosynthesis displays higher rates of photosynthetic activity in these regions. This implies that the efficiency of light absorption by chlorophyll a directly contributes to the rate at which photosynthesis occurs. However, the correlation is not complete, as other pigments and factors also play roles in photosynthesis.",
    "explanation": "By comparing the graphs, one can see that the wavelengths most effectively absorbed by chlorophyll a, particularly in the blue and red regions, are also where the action spectrum shows higher rates of photosynthesis.

    "correct_answer": "Primary pigments, chiefly chlorophyll a, are vital for the direct absorption of light and conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Accessory pigments, such as chlorophyll b, xanthophylls, and carotenoids, expand the range of light wavelengths that can be absorbed and transfer this energy to chlorophyll a. Additionally, these accessory pigments provide photoprotection by preventing photo-oxidation of chlorophyll a. Together, these pigments ensure that plants maximize energy capture across the light spectrum while safeguarding the photosynthetic machinery.",
    "explanation": "This answer considers the individual and collective functions of pigments. Primary pigments absorb light energy efficiently and initiate photosynthesis, while accessory pigments broaden the usable light range and protect against damage by excess light.
