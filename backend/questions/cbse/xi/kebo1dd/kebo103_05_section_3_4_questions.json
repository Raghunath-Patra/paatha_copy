    "correct_answer": "In gymnosperms, pollen grains are released from the microsporangia and carried by air currents to the ovules. When the pollen grain lands near the ovule, a pollen tube grows towards the archegonia, carrying the male gametes to the egg. Fertilization occurs when the gametes unite, forming a zygote that develops into an embryo within the seed.",

These features enable gymnosperms to conserve water and survive under conditions of extreme temperature, low humidity, and high wind speeds. Additionally, these adaptations support photosynthetic efficiency in challenging climates.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes wherein the gametophyte is independent and free-living, gymnosperms have highly reduced gametophytes that develop within the sporangia on the sporophyte. In gymnosperms, the male gametophyte is reduced to the pollen grain, and the female gametophyte is retained within the megasporangium. This reduction protects the gametophyte from environmental stresses and improves the efficiency of fertilization by keeping the necessary structures close together, which can be seen as an evolutionary advantage in terms of resource allocation and protection.",
