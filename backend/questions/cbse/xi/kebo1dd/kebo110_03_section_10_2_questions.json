    "correct_answer": "Chromosomal condensation during prophase compacts the DNA, making it easier to segregate without entanglement, while the movement of duplicated centrosomes and the formation of microtubule asters lay the groundwork for the spindle apparatus. During metaphase, the fully condensed chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, where attachment of spindle fibers at the kinetochores guarantees that each sister chromatid is connected to opposite poles. This coordinated series of events ensures that when chromatids separate in anaphase, each resulting daughter cell inherits an identical set of chromosomes.",

    "correct_answer": "One experimental design could involve treating a population of cultured cells with a microtubule-disrupting agent such as colchicine, while keeping a control group untreated. The progress of mitosis in both groups would be monitored by fluorescence microscopy using chromosome-specific stains. Predicted outcomes include delayed or arrested mitosis in treated cells, improper formation of the spindle apparatus during prophase and metaphase, misalignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, and errors in chromatid segregation during anaphase, leading to aneuploid daughter cells.",
