    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Glycolysis involves ten enzymatically controlled reactions. Initially, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase, requiring one ATP molecule. Fructose-6-phosphate then becomes fructose-1,6-bisphosphate using another ATP. This molecule is split into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and PGAL. PGAL is oxidized to 1, 3-BPGA while reducing NAD+ to NADH. Later steps, including the conversion of 1,3-BPGA to 3-phosphoglyceric acid and conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid, produce ATP. These steps collectively prepare the cell for further energy production and provide important intermediates for other metabolic processes.",

    "correct_answer": "Glycolysis is fundamental to cellular respiration because it initiates glucose metabolism in all cells. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate produced from glycolysis enters the Krebs cycle for complete oxidation to CO₂ and H₂O, yielding a high amount of ATP. Under anaerobic conditions, cells rely on fermentation (lactic acid or alcoholic) to regenerate NAD+, allowing glycolysis to continue but with lower ATP yields. Thus, while glycolysis is less efficient on its own, its universality and versatility enable energy production regardless of oxygen availability.",
