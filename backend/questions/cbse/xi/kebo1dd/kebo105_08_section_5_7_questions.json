The hilum marks the point where the seed was attached to the fruit, and the micropyle is a pore that permits water entry. The cotyledons store food reserves, the radicle develops into the root, and the plumule becomes the shoot, all of which contribute to the successful germination and development of the plant.",

    "correct_answer": "Dicotyledonous seeds typically possess two cotyledons and a distinct seed coat comprising an outer testa and an inner tegmen, with the embryo featuring both a radicle and a plumule. In many dicots, the endosperm may be absent or plays a lesser role, with cotyledons storing sufficient food. In contrast, monocotyledonous seeds often have a single, shield-shaped cotyledon (scutellum) and the seed coat is merged with the fruit wall. Their large endosperm serves as the primary food reserve, and they include specialized structures such as the coleoptile and coleorhiza that protect the plumule and radicle respectively.",
