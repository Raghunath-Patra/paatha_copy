    "correct_answer": "Binary fission in bacteria is an asexual reproductive process where a single bacterial cell replicates its DNA and divides into two identical daughter cells. The process begins with the replication of the bacterium's DNA. Then, the cell membrane invaginates, and the cytoplasm divides, aided by the cell wall which provides rigidity and protection. This process is efficient for rapid population growth under favorable conditions, as it ensures that every daughter cell inherits a complete copy of the genetic material.",
