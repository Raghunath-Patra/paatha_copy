    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An action potential is initiated when a stimulus causes the membrane at a specific site to become more permeable to Na+, leading to a rapid influx of Na+ and depolarization of the membrane. As the depolarization reaches a threshold, an action potential is generated. The depolarized region then influences adjacent regions, causing Na+ channels to open sequentially along the axon. Shortly after, K+ channels open, allowing K+ to flow out and repolarize the membrane. This cycle of depolarization and repolarization propagates along the axon until the impulse reaches the axon terminals.",

While electrical synapses allow for faster transmission, chemical synapses provide greater flexibility in modulating the signal, including excitatory and inhibitory responses.",
