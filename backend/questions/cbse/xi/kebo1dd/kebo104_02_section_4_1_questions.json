The tissue level is present in coelenterates where cells of similar function group together, while the organ level involves the formation of organs through the grouping of tissues, as seen in Platyhelminthes. Finally, higher animals like echinoderms and chordates exhibit an organ system level where multiple organs function together to perform complex physiological processes.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The presence of a body cavity, or coelom, is crucial in animal classification as it provides a protected space for organ development. Coelomates have a true coelom completely lined by mesoderm, allowing for greater complexity in organ systems. Pseudocoelomates have a body cavity that is only partially lined by mesoderm, indicating a lower level of organizational complexity. Acoelomates lack a body cavity entirely, with the mesoderm filling the space between the ectoderm and endoderm, leading to even simpler body plans.",
