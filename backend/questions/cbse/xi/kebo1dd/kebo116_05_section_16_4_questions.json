    "correct_answer": "The counter current mechanism is vital for mammals living in environments where water is scarce because it allows the kidney to produce highly concentrated urine. By establishing and maintaining a sharp osmolarity gradient from the cortex to the inner medulla, the kidney enables more water to be reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the bloodstream. This efficient water reclamation minimizes water loss and maximizes conservation during periods of limited water availability, ensuring that the body retains essential fluids and maintains homeostasis.",

    "correct_answer": "The vasa recta are long, hairpin-shaped capillaries that run parallel to Henle's loop, allowing them to function as counter current exchangers. Their structure, with descending and ascending limbs, permits a slow blood flow which is essential for equilibrating solute levels without significantly disrupting the osmolarity gradient. This anatomical arrangement ensures minimal washout of solutes from the medulla and helps to recycle NaCl and urea back into the interstitium, thereby reinforcing the gradient needed for water reabsorption and urine concentration.",

    "correct_answer": "The counter current mechanism is highly effective, as it enables the human kidney to produce urine that is nearly four times as concentrated as the initial filtrate. Starting with a filtrate of about 300 mOsmol/L, the gradient established in the medulla allows water to be reabsorbed from the collecting duct, ultimately yielding urine with an osmolarity of roughly 1200 mOsmol/L.
