    "correct_answer": "The proton gradient is essential because it provides the energy needed for ATP synthase to produce ATP. If this gradient is disrupted, ATP synthesis would decrease or stop, leading to insufficient ATP for the Calvin cycle and other energy-requiring processes. This would ultimately impair the efficiency of photosynthesis and limit the plant's ability to fix carbon and produce sugars.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The electron transport chain starts with the absorption of light by photosystem II, which excites electrons that are transferred along an electron transport chain in a downhill redox potential sequence. As these electrons move, the energy released is used to pump protons into the thylakoid lumen, establishing a proton gradient. This proton motive force drives ATP synthesis via ATP synthase (chemiosmotic mechanism). Simultaneously, electrons are passed to photosystem I, where they are re-excited and finally transferred to NADP+ to form NADPH. Both ATP and NADPH are then used in the Calvin cycle for the fixation of CO2 and synthesis of sugars.",
