    "correct_answer": "An experiment could be designed where two groups of cells are isolated: one with diploid cells and the other with haploid cells from a species of social insects or lower plants. Both groups would be cultured under identical conditions and treated with a cell division marker (such as BrdU). Mitotic indices (the percentage of cells undergoing mitosis) would then be measured over time. The expected outcome is that while both groups undergo mitosis, any differences in rate or pattern could indicate specialized roles or regulatory mechanisms in haploid versus diploid cells. The experiment could also include gene expression analysis of key mitotic regulators to further elucidate the differences.",
