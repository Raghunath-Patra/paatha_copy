In the alveoli, high pO2, low pCO2, lower H+ concentration, and lower temperature favor the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin, forming oxyhaemoglobin. In contrast, in the tissues where pO2 is lower, pCO2 and H+ concentration are higher and temperature is elevated, the conditions promote the release of oxygen.",

    "correct_answer": "Carbonic anhydrase is crucial in catalyzing the reversible reaction that converts CO2 and H2O into carbonic acid, which subsequently dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. This reaction facilitates the efficient transport of CO2 from tissues to the lungs by converting the majority of CO2 into bicarbonate, which is more soluble and easier to transport in the blood. In the lungs, the reaction reverses, allowing CO2 to be expelled from the body. This enzyme thus plays a key role in regulating acid-base balance and ensuring proper gas exchange.",

    "correct_answer": "An experimental design could involve preparing multiple blood samples maintained at different temperatures while controlling for other variables such as pO2, pCO2, and pH. The independent variable would be temperature while the dependent variable is the percentage saturation of haemoglobin. A control sample at a standard temperature would be maintained. The expected outcome is that higher temperatures would shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, indicating a lower affinity for oxygen, while lower temperatures would shift the curve to the left, indicating a higher affinity. Data collection through oximetry and plotting the resultant curves would validate the impact of temperature on oxygen binding.",
