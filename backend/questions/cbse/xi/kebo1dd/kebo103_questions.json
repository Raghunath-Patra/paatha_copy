    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Algae are classified mainly on the basis of their pigments (such as chlorophyll a, b, fucoxanthin, phycoerythrin), the nature of their storage products (starch, mannitol, laminarin, floridean starch), cell wall composition, and flagellation patterns.",
    "explanation": "The chapter explains that algae are divided into groups like Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae, and Rhodophyceae based on differences in pigment composition, storage materials, cell wall constituents, and also subtle differences in flagellar numbers and positions in cells. These characteristics serve as key criteria for classification.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In liverworts and mosses, reduction division occurs in the sporophyte capsule (after fertilization, the zygote develops into a sporophyte which later undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores). In ferns, reduction division takes place in the sporangia on the undersurface of the fronds. In gymnosperms and angiosperms, reduction division occurs in specialized sporangia – the microsporangia (leading to pollen grains) and megasporangia (within ovules to produce megaspores) during micro- and megasporogenesis respectively.",
    "explanation": "Although the dominant phase differs among these groups, reduction division (meiosis) is characteristic of the sporophyte generation in all. In non-vascular plants such as liverworts and mosses, the sporophyte is short-lived and confined to the capsule, while in vascular plants like ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, specialized structures (sporangia in ferns; microsporangia and megasporangia in gymnosperms and angiosperms) carry out meiosis to ensure the production of haploid spores.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Three groups of plants that bear archegonia include bryophytes (such as liverworts and mosses), pteridophytes (ferns), and gymnosperms. For example, in liverworts, the free-living gametophyte (thalloid or leafy body) produces multicellular sex organs; the flask-shaped archegonium (female) produces a single egg, and the antheridium (male) produces biflagellate sperm. Fertilization occurs in water, leading to the formation of a zygote and subsequent development of a sporophyte (which is attached to the gametophyte). The sporophyte eventually undergoes meiosis in the capsule to yield spores, thus completing the cycle.",
    "explanation": "The chapter describes that archegonia are present in bryophytes, ferns, and in some manner in gymnosperms where the female gametophyte is retained within the ovule. The detailed life cycle of liverworts, for instance, illustrates the alternation of generations with a prominent gametophyte stage and a dependent sporophyte that produces spores via reduction division.",

    "explanation": "The ploidy levels reflect the alternation of generations. In non-vascular plants such as mosses and liverworts, the dominant phase is the haploid gametophyte while the sporophyte (though transient) is diploid.

Examples include Selaginella and Salvinia.",

They typically have naked ovules, produce seeds on the surfaces of reproductive structures (cones or strobili), and are heterosporous. Their vegetative structure usually includes a dominant sporophyte with features such as tap roots, and in many cases, needle-like or scale-like leaves.

    "correct_answer": "Angiosperms utilize flowers as their reproductive structures, which contain both the pollen-producing organs and the ovules. After fertilization, the ovary develops into a fruit that encloses the seeds. In contrast, gymnosperms do not have flowers; their ovules are exposed (naked) on cone scales or similar structures, and they do not develop fruits. This fundamental difference affects how the seeds are protected and dispersed in these two groups.",
