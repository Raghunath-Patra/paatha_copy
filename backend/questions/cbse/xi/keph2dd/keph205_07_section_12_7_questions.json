    "correct_answer": "The mean free path provides insight into the average distance a molecule travels before colliding, which underpins the kinetic theory of gases. This distance influences how momentum and energy are transferred between layers of gas, thereby affecting macroscopic properties like viscosity and heat conductivity. A longer mean free path typically means that molecules transfer energy and momentum over larger distances, impacting the overall resistance to flow (viscosity) and the rate of energy transfer (thermal conductivity). Additionally, knowledge of the mean free path is crucial in understanding diffusion processes and helps in the design and analysis of systems where gas properties are critical.",
    "explanation": "The mean free path is central to the molecular interpretation of viscosity and thermal conductivity. When molecules travel longer distances between collisions, momentum and energy transfer occurs over larger distances. This concept links microscopic behavior to macroscopic observables through the kinetic theory, enabling predictions about how changing parameters (like density or molecular size) affect properties such as viscosity and conductivity.",

    "correct_answer": "The formula for the mean free path is derived under several simplifying assumptions: the molecules are modeled as hard spheres of uniform diameter, collisions are considered binary, and the initial derivation assumes that molecules (other than the one considered) are at rest. In reality, all molecules are in motion, necessitating the adjustment by the √2 factor. Furthermore, the derivation neglects factors such as variations in molecular speed, non-spherical shapes, and multi-body collisions. Also, in dense gases or at high pressures, interactions between molecules can become more complex, invalidating the assumption of independent collisions. These limitations mean that while the formula provides a useful first approximation, deviations in experimental measurements may require more sophisticated models.",
    "explanation": "The derivation’s simplicity is its strength and weakness. It allows for clear analytical insight but fails to capture the complexity of real molecular interactions.
