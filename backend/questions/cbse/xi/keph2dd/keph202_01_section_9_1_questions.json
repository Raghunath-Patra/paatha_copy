    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Fluids offer much less resistance to shear stress because their molecules are not arranged in a rigid structure like solids. This low resistance allows them to flow easily. One real-world implication is that liquids can be stirred or pumped with minimal force, making them ideal for various applications such as lubrication and coolant systems.",
    "explanation": "The molecular arrangement in fluids permits them to readily rearrange under small forces. This quality is essential in processes where smooth flow is required, and it distinguishes fluids from solids which resist deformation.",

    "correct_answer": "Gases are significantly affected by external pressure because their molecules are widely spaced, making them highly compressible. In contrast, liquids and solids have closely packed molecules, so their volumes change very little when external pressure is increased.",
    "explanation": "The high compressibility of gases is a direct result of the large intermolecular distances. This is why, under increased pressure, a gas's volume can change drastically, whereas liquids and solids, with more rigid molecular arrangements, exhibit negligible volume changes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Solids have a fixed volume and shape, are nearly incompressible, and offer high resistance to shear stress. Liquids maintain a fixed volume under atmospheric pressure but take the shape of their container, are almost incompressible, and offer very little resistance to shear stress. Gases, on the other hand, not only take the shape of their container but also fill it completely; they are highly compressible due to the large distance between molecules, and they offer minimal resistance to shear stress. For example, a block of metal (solid) retains its shape, water (liquid) conforms to a cup, and air (gas) fills a balloon.",
    "explanation": "This answer illustrates the fundamental differences between the three states of matter with respect to volume and shape. The explanation incorporates compressibility and shear stress concepts, emphasizing that while solids are rigid, liquids and gases are deformable in response to forces.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experiment could involve using a rheometer to apply controlled shear stress to both a solid sample and a fluid sample. The setup would include a motorized plate connected to the sample with a sensor to measure shear force. The variables to be controlled are temperature, sample size, and initial conditions. For the solid, the minimal shear stress required for deformation would be recorded, while for the fluid, the shear stress at which it begins to flow significantly would be measured. Expected outcomes include a much lower shear stress threshold for the fluid compared to the solid. Error analysis would involve repeating the experiment multiple times, calibrating the sensor, and accounting for any variations in temperature or mechanical vibrations. Improvements might include isolating the apparatus from external vibrations and refining the sensor sensitivity.",
    "explanation": "This experiment leverages the basic differences in mechanical response between solids and fluids. Utilizing a rheometer allows precise measurement of shear stress. Controlling variables and conducting error analysis ensures reliability of the results, which could then be used to quantitatively compare the mechanical properties of the two states of matter.",
