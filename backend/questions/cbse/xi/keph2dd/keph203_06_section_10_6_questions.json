While specific heat capacity is useful for comparing substances in mass-based applications, molar specific heat capacity is particularly important in chemical contexts where substances are often measured in moles.",
    "explanation": "Molar specific heat capacity (C) is calculated by dividing the specific heat capacity (S) by the number of moles (µ) of the substance. Its SI unit is J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹.

    "correct_answer": "To determine the specific heat capacity experimentally, one heats a known mass of a substance using a heat source and measures the time taken for a specific temperature change. By knowing the power output of the heat source and the time involved, one can calculate the total energy (heat) delivered to the substance. Using the relation S = ΔQ/ (mΔT), where ΔQ is the total heat added, m is the mass, and ΔT is the temperature change, the specific heat capacity can be found. The experiment must be carefully controlled to ensure minimal heat losses and accurate measurements.",
    "explanation": "The method involves using a stopwatch to measure the time for a known temperature difference and assuming a constant rate of heat supply. This relates directly to the equation S = ΔQ / (mΔT), where accurate determination of ΔQ (via power and time) is crucial. The procedure is an application of energy conservation in thermodynamics.",

Additionally, the slower rate of temperature change in water versus land affects local weather patterns, such as the cooling effect of sea breezes during hot days.",
