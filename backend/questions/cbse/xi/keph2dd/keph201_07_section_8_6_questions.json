    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "correct_answer": "A deep rectangular beam is advantageous because increasing depth dramatically reduces bending (deflection ∝ d^-3) for a given load. However, if the load is not applied exactly at the center or is eccentric, the beam can experience buckling. To overcome this, engineers often use cross-sectional designs such as the I-beam, which provides sufficient depth to minimize bending while distributing the load across a wider area to reduce the risk of buckling.",
    "explanation": "The deep beam strategy takes advantage of the cubic relation between depth and deflection, meaning even a small increase in depth can significantly lower bending. However, deep beams are more sensitive to eccentric loading, which can trigger lateral instability or buckling. The I-beam, with its flanges and web, effectively increases the moment of inertia without excessive material use, thus striking a balance between structural efficiency and safety.",

This more even distribution of stress provides enhanced load-bearing capacity compared to a pillar with rounded ends, where stress may concentrate at certain points, potentially reducing overall capacity.",
    "explanation": "The distributed ends create a larger area over which the compressive forces are applied, decreasing the force per unit area.
