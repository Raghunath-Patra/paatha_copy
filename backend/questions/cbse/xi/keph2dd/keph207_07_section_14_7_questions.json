    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": [
      "The waves must have exactly the same frequency.",
      "The waves must have exactly the same amplitude and exactly equal frequencies.",
      "The waves must have nearly equal frequencies and similar amplitudes.",
      "The waves must have widely different frequencies."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "The waves must have nearly equal frequencies and similar amplitudes.",
    "explanation": "Beats occur when two harmonic waves with nearly equal frequencies and similar amplitudes interfere. This interference produces an amplitude modulation with a frequency equal to the difference between the two frequencies.",
