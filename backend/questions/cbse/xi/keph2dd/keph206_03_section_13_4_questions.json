In uniform circular motion, the necessary centripetal force, required to keep the particle moving in a circle, is provided by F = mω²A or F = mv²/A.

Comparing this with x1(t) = A cos((πt)/2 + π/3), the phase difference is ( (πt)/2 + π/3 ) - ( (πt)/2 - π/2 ) = π/3 + π/2 = (2π/6 + 3π/6) = 5π/6. However, a careful reexamination shows that the intended comparison may require aligning the phase such that equivalent expressions are found. A more straightforward method is to express both in cosine form: x1(t) remains A cos((πt)/2 + π/3), and x2(t) = A cos((πt)/2 - π/2). The phase difference is |(π/3) - (-π/2)| = (π/3 + π/2) = (2π/6 + 3π/6) = 5π/6. Therefore, the phase difference is 5π/6 radians.
