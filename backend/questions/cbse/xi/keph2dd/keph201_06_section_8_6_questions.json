Using the principles of static equilibrium and the relationship between bending moment and curvature (M = YI(d²y/dx²)) where I is the second moment of area, one integrates the differential equation twice to obtain the deflection curve. The maximum deflection δ occurs at the center and is found to be δ = Wl³ / (48YI). For a rectangular beam, the second moment of area I = bd³/12, and substituting gives δ = Wl³ / (4bd³Y). Assumptions include small deflections, linear elastic behavior, and that the beam is homogeneous and isotropic.",

    "correct_answer": "The maximum height of a mountain is determined by equating the shear stress at the base due to the mountain's weight (hρg) to the elastic limit of the rock. Given that the elastic limit for typical rock is 30 x 10⁷ N/m², density (ρ) is 3 x 10³ kg/m³, and g is 10 m/s², we set hρg = 30 x 10⁷ N/m². Solving for h gives h = (30 x 10⁷) / (3 x 10³ x 10) = 10 km. This shows that if a mountain were taller, the stress would exceed the rock's elastic limit, leading to flow or deformation that prevents further height increase.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A deep beam cross-section reduces bending since deflection is inversely proportional to the cube of the depth (d³). However, if the beam is too deep, improper load placement may lead to buckling—a sudden lateral deflection due to instability. The trade-off involves optimizing depth to achieve minimal bending while ensuring that the load is applied properly and the shape (often an I-beam) provides lateral stability. Additionally, using materials with high Young's modulus and carefully designing the support conditions can further mitigate both bending and buckling issues.",
