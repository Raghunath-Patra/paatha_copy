    "explanation": "Since the same physical point (triple point of water) is assigned 200 on scale A and 350 on scale B, the conversion factor is 350/200 = 7/4? However, note that the relation is linear and of the form: TA = m*TB + c. With only one fixed point, one typically assumes the zero is common. Assuming a direct proportionality, TA/200 = TB/350, therefore TB = (350/200) TA = (7/4) TA. (There is potential ambiguity; assuming both scales start at absolute zero, the relation is TB = (7/4) TA.)",

What is wrong in taking the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water as standard fixed points (as was originally done in the Celsius scale)?\n(b) There were two fixed points in the original Celsius scale which were assigned the numbers 0 °C and 100 °C respectively.

    "correct_answer": "(a) The triple-point of water is reproducible and defined exactly, eliminating uncertainties due to impurities or pressure variations. Melting and boiling points vary with pressure and can be less precisely determined; (b) The other fixed point is the boiling point of water at 1 atm, which is 373.15 K; (c) The offset is 273.15 because the Celsius scale was redefined such that the triple-point of water is exactly 273.16 K, but the unit size remains identical to that of the Celsius degree, so the conversion uses 273.15 for practical purposes; (d) On the Fahrenheit scale, the triple point of water is approximately 80.33 °F.",
    "explanation": "Modern thermometry uses the triple point of water as it is a unique, reproducible fixed point independent of impurities and pressure variations. The boiling point of water (373.15 K) serves as the second fixed point on the Kelvin scale. The slight numerical difference in the conversion offset (273.15 vs 273.16) arises from historical adjustments ensuring that the degree size remains the same.
