    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Standing waves in a column occur when two waves of equal frequency and amplitude traveling in opposite directions superimpose, resulting in fixed points of zero displacement called nodes and points of maximum oscillation called antinodes. The nodes occur because of destructive interference, while the antinodes occur due to constructive interference.",
    "explanation": "When a wave traveling down a medium reflects from a boundary, such as a fixed end, it interferes with the incoming wave. The superposition of these waves, when they have the same frequency and amplitude, produces a standing wave pattern. Nodes remain stationary because the interfering waves cancel each other out at those points, while at antinodes the wave amplitudes add up. This phenomenon is crucial in understanding resonance in instruments and pipes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Progressive waves are disturbances that travel through a medium without any net movement of the entire medium, whereas a stream involves the mass movement of the medium itself. An example of a progressive wave is the traveling pulse on a string or sound waves in air, where only the disturbance propagates, leaving the medium vibrating about its equilibrium position.",
    "explanation": "In progressive wave motion, energy is transferred through the medium by oscillations of its particles. Although the disturbances (e.g., pulses on a string or sound waves) move from one location to another, the individual particles oscillate around their fixed equilibrium positions. This is different from a stream where the fluid itself is transported. The distinction is important in understanding energy transfer in waves versus bulk motion in fluids.",
