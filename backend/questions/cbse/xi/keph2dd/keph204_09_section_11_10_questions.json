    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Irreversibility in thermodynamic processes arises due to dissipative effects such as friction, viscosity, and inelastic collisions. For instance, when a moving object comes to a stop due to friction on a surface, its mechanical energy is irreversibly converted to heat. Similarly, in a fluid, viscosity causes a rotating object to lose kinetic energy to the fluid as heat. These phenomena contribute to the overall increase in entropy and prevent the exact reversal of the process.",
    "explanation": "Dissipative effects lead to energy degradation in the system, meaning that once energy is converted into heat due to friction or viscosity, it cannot be entirely recovered as useful work. These irreversible energy losses are fundamental to explaining the natural tendency towards increased entropy, as outlined by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "correct_answer": "The Carnot cycle is significant because it represents an idealized reversible process that establishes the upper limit of efficiency for any heat engine operating between two given temperatures. The efficiency of a Carnot engine depends solely on the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, calculated using the formula Efficiency = 1 - (T_cold/T_hot). This theoretical maximum sets a benchmark against which all real (and inherently irreversible) engines are measured.",
    "explanation": "By relying on reversible processes, the Carnot cycle avoids the energy losses inherent in real processes due to factors like friction and dissipation. Therefore, it provides a conceptual standard: while no practical engine can reach this maximum efficiency, understanding the Carnot limit helps engineers design systems that approach this ideal as closely as possible, highlighting the importance of reducing irreversibility.",

An example is the quasi-static isothermal expansion of an ideal gas with a frictionless piston. In contrast, irreversible processes, such as the free expansion of a gas or the cooking gas diffusing in a room, involve spontaneous changes and dissipative effects that prevent the exact restoration of the initial conditions, thereby increasing the overall entropy.",
    "explanation": "The key differences lie in system equilibrium and energy dissipation.
