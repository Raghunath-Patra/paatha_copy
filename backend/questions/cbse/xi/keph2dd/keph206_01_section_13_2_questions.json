    "correct_answer": "Damping in an oscillatory system is the gradual loss of energy (usually due to friction or resistance) that causes the motion to eventually die out, such as the swinging of a pendulum coming to rest. Forced oscillations involve applying an external periodic force to sustain or modify the oscillation, such as a child being pushed on a swing.",
    "explanation": "The text indicates that although oscillating bodies are damped by friction and dissipative forces and eventually come to rest, they can be maintained in motion through external forces.

    "correct_answer": "In simple harmonic motion, the restoring force acting on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position and is directed toward that equilibrium. Mathematically, this is represented by F = -kx for a spring system, where k is the spring constant. This proportionality leads to a sinusoidal motion described by functions such as sin(ωt) or cos(ωt).",
    "explanation": "The concept of SHM is introduced as the simplest form of oscillatory motion. The restoring force, which always acts to return the system to its equilibrium, is proportional to the displacement. This relationship causes the system to undergo periodic, sinusoidal motions. The negative sign indicates that the force is always opposite to the displacement.",
