    "correct_answer": "At low temperatures, intermolecular forces and the finite size of gas molecules become significant, leading to deviations from the ideal gas law which assumes point particles with no interactions. Despite these deviations, over a large temperature range the pressure versus temperature relationship remains linear and can be extrapolated to predict absolute zero. This extrapolated intercept at -273.15°C (0 K) serves as a theoretical lower limit on temperature and forms the foundation of the Kelvin scale.",
    "explanation": "The ideal gas law simplifies the behavior of gases by ignoring intermolecular forces and molecular volumes, which become important at low temperatures. Real gases deviate from ideal behavior under these conditions; however, the linear portion of the pressure versus temperature graph still allows scientists to extrapolate and define absolute zero.

By calibrating the thermometer at known temperature points (such as the freezing and boiling points of water), the observed pressure can be converted into a temperature reading.",
    "explanation": "In a constant-volume gas thermometer, the gas is confined to a fixed volume so that any change in temperature directly alters the pressure.
