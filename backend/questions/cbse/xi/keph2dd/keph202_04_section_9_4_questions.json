This work is used to change the kinetic energy (½ρΔV (v2² - v1²)) and the gravitational potential energy (ρgΔV (h2 - h1)) of the fluid element. Setting the work equal to the change in energy yields: (P1 - P2) = (1/2)ρ (v2² - v1²) + ρg (h2 - h1). Rearranging gives the form P + (1/2)ρv² + ρgh = constant.

    "correct_answer": "Bernoulli's equation assumes that the fluid is incompressible, nonviscous, and undergoing steady, streamline flow with no energy loss from friction. In real fluid flows, viscosity introduces internal friction between layers, leading to energy dissipation in the form of heat. Additionally, in compressible flows, changes in density as well as turbulent fluctuations can cause significant deviations. Therefore, Bernoulli's equation may fail to accurately predict behavior in turbulent, compressible, or highly viscous flows where energy losses are significant.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An aerofoil is designed so that the upper surface is more curved than the lower surface, which results in airflow having to travel a longer distance over the top. According to Bernoulli's principle, a higher speed of airflow corresponds to a lower pressure. Thus, the air moving over the curved upper surface has lower pressure compared to the underside, where the air flows more slowly. This pressure differential generates an upward force, or lift, which is sufficient to counteract the weight of the aircraft. The analysis involves integrating these pressure differences over the entire surface of the wing to explain how sufficient lift is generated.",
    "explanation": "The answer should detail that the streamlined shape of the aerofoil forces a higher speed on the upper surface (leading to lower pressure) and slower speed on the lower surface (higher pressure), thereby producing a net upward force.
