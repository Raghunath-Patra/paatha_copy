    "correct_answer": "The internal energy of a system refers to the energy associated with the microscopic disordered motions of its particles, which contributes to temperature. In contrast, the kinetic energy of a moving bullet is associated with its macroscopic translational motion. When the bullet is in flight, it has significant kinetic energy but little internal energy change, whereas its internal energy is affected only when it slows down or stops and converts kinetic energy into heat.",

Key experiments like Count Rumford's cannon-boring experiment demonstrated that the heat generated was directly proportional to the work done, regardless of the tool's sharpness, contradicting the idea of a scooped-out caloric fluid. This evidence paved the way for the modern energy perspective.",
    "explanation": "Historically, heat was thought to be a special fluid that flowed from hot to cold bodies, analogous to liquid flowing from one container to another. Count Rumford’s experiment showed that mechanical work, such as boring, produced large quantities of heat—implying that heat could be generated continuously by doing work, a concept incompatible with a conserved fluid. This led to the eventual acceptance of heat as a form of energy and was instrumental in the development of the first law of thermodynamics.",

    "correct_answer": "Thermodynamics deals with bulk properties of matter such as pressure, volume, and temperature and does not require detailed knowledge of individual particles. In contrast, kinetic theory involves statistical descriptions of molecular motions including positions and velocities. Hence, thermodynamic descriptions use a small set of measurable variables, ignoring the numerous microscopic details present in kinetic theory.",
    "explanation": "Thermodynamics focuses on observable quantities and macroscopic variables that emerge from the collective behavior of a system's particles, making it practical for engineering applications. Kinetic theory, while more detailed regarding molecular distributions and motion, is less convenient for describing large systems because of the enormous number of variables involved.

    "correct_answer": "One example is frictional heating: when two surfaces rub against each other, the work done against friction is converted into heat. Another example is the braking process in vehicles, where kinetic energy is transformed into thermal energy by the brakes. Factors such as material properties, surface roughness, and the rate of work done affect the efficiency of this conversion.",
    "explanation": "In frictional heating, the efficiency of conversion depends on the coefficient of friction and the contact area between the surfaces. In braking, the design of brake pads and the heat dissipation characteristics play crucial roles. Both cases demonstrate that while the first law of thermodynamics ensures energy conservation, real processes involve losses and inefficiencies influenced by physical properties and conditions of the materials involved.",
