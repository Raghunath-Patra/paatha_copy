For longitudinal waves, the displacement function is s(x,t) = a sin(kx - ωt + φ), where the displacement (s) is along the direction of propagation. In both functions, 'a' is the amplitude representing the maximum displacement, 'k' is the angular wave number related to the wavelength (λ = 2π/k), 'ω' is the angular frequency related to the period (T = 2π/ω), and 'φ' is the initial phase. The differences lie in the direction of the displacement relative to the wave’s propagation.",

    "correct_answer": "As time progresses, the graph shifts along the x-axis because the term (kx - ωt + φ) remains constant for a moving crest. Monitoring a crest shows the propagation of the wave. Additionally, by fixing a point (e.g., x = 0), one observes the particle undergoing simple harmonic motion, oscillating about its equilibrium position. This duality distinguishes the traveling wave's spatial form from the temporal oscillation of individual medium elements.",
    "explanation": "The phase (kx - ωt + φ) determines that for an increase in time, to keep the phase constant (such as at a crest), the position x must also increase, indicating wave propagation. Meanwhile, a fixed point on the medium will experience periodic oscillations (simple harmonic motion) as the wave passes through it.

The angular frequency ω = 3.0 rad/s provides the period T = 2π/3.0, which is approximately 2.09 s, and the frequency is the reciprocal of the period, around 0.48 Hz. For a specific displacement calculation at x = 0.30 m and t = 20 s, substitute into the equation: y = 0.005 sin(80 × 0.30 - 3.0 × 20) = 0.005 sin(24 - 60) = 0.005 sin(-36).
