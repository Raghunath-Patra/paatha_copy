    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The molar specific heat capacity of solids is approximately equal to 3R because, according to the equipartition theorem, each atom in a solid has three degrees of freedom corresponding to vibrations in three dimensions. Each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kB T of kinetic energy plus (1/2)kB T of potential energy, totaling kB T per degree. For three dimensions, the energy is 3kB T per atom, and for one mole, it is 3R T. Differentiating with respect to temperature gives 3R.",
    "explanation": "Using the equipartition theorem, each quadratic degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kB T. Since vibrational modes have both kinetic and potential energy contributions, each degree contributes kB T and there are three degrees. Multiplying by Avogadro's number converts kB to R, yielding an energy of 3R T per mole, and hence a molar heat capacity of 3R.",

    "correct_answer": "Starting with the first law for a process at constant pressure: Delta Q = Delta U + P Delta V. At constant volume, Delta Q = Delta U so that Cv = (Delta U/Delta T). For an ideal gas, U depends only on temperature. At constant pressure, Cp = (Delta U/Delta T) + P (Delta V/Delta T). Using the ideal gas law PV = RT and differentiating with respect to temperature at constant pressure gives P (Delta V/Delta T) = R. Combining these, we get Cp = Cv + R, so that Cp - Cv = R.",
    "explanation": "The derivation uses the fact that the internal energy U of an ideal gas depends only on T. Under constant volume, all the absorbed heat goes to increasing U, i.e., Delta Q = Delta U. At constant pressure, additional work is done, expressed as P Delta V. By differentiating the ideal gas law, one finds that P(Delta V/Delta T) = R. Substituting into the expression for Cp leads directly to the relation Cp - Cv = R.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "At low temperatures, quantum effects become significant and not all vibrational modes are excited. The equipartition theorem assumes that energy is equally distributed among all available degrees of freedom, which holds true only at higher temperatures where kB T is much larger than the energy spacing between quantized states. At low temperatures, many degrees of freedom remain 'frozen out', leading to lower specific heat values than predicted by the classical 3R value.",
    "explanation": "The equipartition theorem is based on classical mechanics and assumes continuous energy levels. However, at low temperatures, quantum mechanics dictates that energy levels are discrete and require a certain minimum energy to be excited. When thermal energy kB T is insufficient to excite these higher modes, the specific heat capacity drops below the classical prediction. This phenomenon is known as the quantum mechanical 'freezing out' of vibrational modes.",
