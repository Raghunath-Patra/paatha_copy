    "correct_answer": "Elastic moduli such as Young's modulus, shear modulus, and bulk modulus are critical in determining how materials respond to forces. High values of Young's modulus, as seen in metals like steel, indicate resistance to stretching under tensile loads, making them suitable for structural applications. The shear modulus informs us about a material’s ability to resist shape changes when subjected to shear forces, which is important in applications requiring rigidity. Similarly, the bulk modulus measures resistance to compression and is crucial in designing systems operating under high pressure. Engineers select materials based on these properties to ensure that structures and machine parts endure the expected loads without failure.",
    "explanation": "Elastic moduli provide a quantitative measure of a material's stiffness and are directly used in designing buildings, bridges, and other structures. For example, steel with a high Young's modulus is preferred over aluminum for heavy-duty applications because it requires more force to deform. The shear modulus is significant for components subjected to twisting or sliding forces, and the bulk modulus is key in scenarios where pressure-induced volume changes are critical, such as in underwater or pressurized environments.",

    "correct_answer": "Poisson's ratio is defined as the ratio of lateral strain to longitudinal strain in a material under tensile stress. It can be determined by measuring the decrease in diameter (or lateral dimension) and the corresponding increase in length of a wire under load. A higher Poisson's ratio indicates that a material tends to contract more laterally when stretched. This parameter is significant as it provides insight into the volumetric changes and the degree of coupling between deformation in different directions, impacting how materials are used and modeled in engineering applications.",
    "explanation": "When a wire is stretched, its length increases and its diameter decreases. Poisson's ratio is given by (Δd/d)/(ΔL/L) or equivalently (Δd/ΔL) × (L/d). It is a dimensionless measure that helps predict the three-dimensional strain state resulting from uniaxial loading.
