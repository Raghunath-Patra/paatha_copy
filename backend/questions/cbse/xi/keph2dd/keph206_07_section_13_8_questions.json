For a simple pendulum with a point mass, I = mL², and for small angles, sinθ is approximated by θ, hence α = - (g/L) θ. Recognizing this as the differential equation for simple harmonic motion (d²θ/dt² = - (g/L) θ), the angular frequency is ω = √(g/L), and the period T is given by T = 2π/ω = 2π √(L/g).",

    "correct_answer": "The small angle approximation is based on the Taylor series expansion of sinθ, where sinθ = θ - θ³/6 + θ⁵/120 - …. For small values of θ (in radians), higher-order terms like θ³/6 become negligible. The provided table shows that for an angle of 20° (approximately 0.349 radians), sinθ is about 0.342, which is close to 0.349. This small difference validates the approximation (within a few percent error) for angles up to 20°, making it suitable for simplifying the differential equation of motion in a simple pendulum.",
    "explanation": "By comparing the actual value of sinθ with θ for small angles, it becomes apparent that the approximation introduces only minimal error for angles less than or equal to 20°. This is crucial for proving that the motion is simple harmonic for small oscillations.",

    "correct_answer": "For a simple pendulum, the moment of inertia I is given by mL², and the time period T is derived as T = 2π √(I/(mgL)), which simplifies to T = 2π √(L/g). However, if the bob is not a point mass and the mass distribution causes an increase in I (for instance, I > mL²), then the time period becomes T = 2π √(I/(mgL)). As the moment of inertia increases even with the same string length, the period increases because a larger moment of inertia indicates a greater resistance to changes in angular motion.",
    "explanation": "This analysis is based on the rotational form of Newton's law. An increase in moment of inertia implies a slower angular acceleration for the same applied torque, hence a longer period of oscillation.",
