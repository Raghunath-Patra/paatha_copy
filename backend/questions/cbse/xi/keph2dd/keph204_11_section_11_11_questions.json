    "correct_answer": "Start by considering the isothermal steps where Q₁ = μRT₁ ln(V₂/V₁) during expansion and Q₂ = μRT₂ ln(V₃/V₄) during compression. The net work is W = Q₁ - Q₂. The efficiency is η = W/Q₁ = 1 - (Q₂/Q₁). Using the adiabatic relations, specifically T₁ V₂^(γ-1) = T₂ V₃^(γ-1) and T₂ V₄^(γ-1) = T₁ V₁^(γ-1), it can be shown that V₂/V₁ = V₃/V₄. This implies that Q₂/Q₁ = T₂/T₁. Substituting this back gives η = 1 - (T₂/T₁).",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins with the expressions for heat exchange in the isothermal processes. Adiabatic processes provide a linkage between the volume ratios such that ln(V₂/V₁) = ln(V₃/V₄).

When comparing the two, coupling an irreversible engine with a reversible refrigerator in thought experiments shows that if the irreversible engine were more efficient, it would allow a net extraction of work from the cold reservoir without other changes, violating the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, no irreversible engine can exceed the efficiency of the Carnot engine.",
    "explanation": "The key difference is that reversibility ensures no energy is wasted due to entropy production. Irreversible processes always generate extra entropy, lowering the effective work output.

By calibrating temperature through reversible processes that adhere strictly to this ratio, one can establish a thermodynamic temperature scale. The universality of this relation reinforces that temperature is a fundamental thermodynamic variable.",
    "explanation": "Since the ratio between the heat absorbed and rejected in a Carnot cycle equals the ratio of the absolute temperatures (T₁/T₂), it provides a natural and reproducible method for defining temperature.
