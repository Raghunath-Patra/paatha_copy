    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 1.79",
    "explanation": "Using the formula for elongation ΔL = (F L)/(A Y) and equating the elongation for both wires gives L₍steel₎/(A₍steel₎ Y₍steel₎) = L₍copper₎/(A₍copper₎ Y₍copper₎). Rearranging yields Y₍steel₎/Y₍copper₎ = (L₍steel₎ × A₍copper₎)/(L₍copper₎ × A₍steel₎). Substituting the numerical values: (4.7 m × 4.0×10⁻⁵ m²)/(3.5 m × 3.0×10⁻⁵ m²) ≈ (1.88×10⁻⁴)/(1.05×10⁻⁴) ≈ 1.79.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) Young's modulus is obtained from the slope of the initial linear (elastic) portion of the curve; (b) the yield strength is the stress at the point where the curve starts to deviate from linearity.",
    "explanation": "In a stress–strain curve, the initial linear region represents elastic behavior where stress is directly proportional to strain (Hooke's law). The slope of this portion is the Young's modulus.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Elastic moduli such as Young's modulus, shear modulus, and bulk modulus are critical in determining how materials respond to forces. High values of Young's modulus, as seen in metals like steel, indicate resistance to stretching under tensile loads, making them suitable for structural applications. The shear modulus informs us about a material’s ability to resist shape changes when subjected to shear forces, which is important in applications requiring rigidity. Similarly, the bulk modulus measures resistance to compression and is crucial in designing systems operating under high pressure. Engineers select materials based on these properties to ensure that structures and machine parts endure the expected loads without failure.",
    "explanation": "Elastic moduli provide a quantitative measure of a material's stiffness and are directly used in designing buildings, bridges, and other structures. For example, steel with a high Young's modulus is preferred over aluminum for heavy-duty applications because it requires more force to deform. The shear modulus is significant for components subjected to twisting or sliding forces, and the bulk modulus is key in scenarios where pressure-induced volume changes are critical, such as in underwater or pressurized environments.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Poisson's ratio is defined as the ratio of lateral strain to longitudinal strain in a material under tensile stress. It can be determined by measuring the decrease in diameter (or lateral dimension) and the corresponding increase in length of a wire under load. A higher Poisson's ratio indicates that a material tends to contract more laterally when stretched. This parameter is significant as it provides insight into the volumetric changes and the degree of coupling between deformation in different directions, impacting how materials are used and modeled in engineering applications.",
    "explanation": "When a wire is stretched, its length increases and its diameter decreases. Poisson's ratio is given by (Δd/d)/(ΔL/L) or equivalently (Δd/ΔL) × (L/d). It is a dimensionless measure that helps predict the three-dimensional strain state resulting from uniaxial loading.

Step 3: Substitute into the formula: δ = (1000 N x 27 m³) / [4 x 0.05 m x 0.003375 m³ x 150 x 10⁹ N/m²]. The denominator equals 4 x 0.05 x 0.003375 x 150 x 10⁹ = 0.675 x 150 x 10⁹ = 101.25 x 10⁹.

Each case illustrates how materials behave under different deformation conditions and how internal forces maintain equilibrium.",
    "explanation": "The restoring force is a result of the material’s elastic properties. In tensile stress, the force is distributed along the length causing an elongation with a corresponding strain ΔL/L. In shearing stress, a displacement of Δx between the surfaces leads to a shearing strain Δx/L, approximated by tanθ for small angles. In hydraulic compression, the uniform pressure results in a volume strain ΔV/V. Understanding these responses is key in analyzing material strength and elasticity.",

The deformation is characterized by a displacement Δx between the faces over the original length L, defined as the shearing strain (Δx/L). Additionally, this displacement results in an angular deformation of the cylinder, where tanθ is used to express the angle. For small angles, tanθ approximates θ, directly relating the shearing strain to the angular deformation in radians.",
    "explanation": "When a tangential force is applied, the material layers shift, and the change in shape is quantified by the shearing strain.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A stress-strain curve provides a graphical representation of how a material responds to stress and strain, indicating various properties such as elastic limit, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and fracture point. Brittle materials typically show a small plastic region with the ultimate tensile strength and fracture points being very close, indicating limited deformation before breaking. Ductile materials, on the other hand, exhibit a significant plastic region where the material deforms plastically before fracture, allowing for energy absorption and significant shape changes prior to failure.",
    "explanation": "The stress-strain curve is essential in materials science as it summarizes key mechanical properties. Brittle materials have steep curves that end abruptly, while ductile materials show an extended region of plastic deformation. Evaluating these differences helps engineers choose the right material for specific applications, balancing strength with the ability to absorb energy through plastic deformation.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Elastomers, like rubber and aortic tissue, can undergo very large strains and still return to their original shape, but they do not obey Hooke's law over most of the strain range, and do not display a well-defined plastic region. This behavior is due to their molecular structure, which allows for significant uncoiling and reorientation of polymer chains under stress. Metals, in contrast, have a defined elastic region where Hooke's law applies and a clear yield point marking the onset of plastic deformation, resulting from dislocation movement within a crystalline structure.",
    "explanation": "Elastomers have long-chain polymer molecules that are highly flexible and can extend considerably. Their non-linear stress-strain behavior is a result of the gradual alignment of these chains under load, rather than the uniform, linear response seen in metals. Metals, with their atomic lattice structure, initially behave elastically until the stress exceeds the yield point, after which permanent deformation occurs. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting materials for applications requiring high flexibility or high strength.",

    "correct_answer": "A material subjected to external forces develops internal restoring forces that counteract the applied forces. When forces are applied normal to a cross-sectional area, tensile or compressive stress is produced, leading to longitudinal strain (ΔL/L). When forces are applied tangentially, they produce shearing stress, causing shearing strain (Δx/L or tanθ), which is associated with an angular displacement. In hydraulic compression, a uniform force is applied perpendicular to all surfaces of an object, creating hydraulic stress and resulting in a volume strain (ΔV/V), with the shape remaining almost unchanged.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In tensile stress cases, the material develops a restoring force per unit area that counteracts any elongation or compression along the length (longitudinal strain). Under shearing stress, adjacent layers of material slide relative to each other, and the restoring force similarly works to return these layers to their original positions (shearing strain). In hydraulic stress, the force is applied uniformly, and although the shape remains mostly unchanged, the volume decreases; here the restoring force per unit area is equivalent to the hydraulic pressure. In all cases, the internal forces develop to undo the deformation, but the nature of the force (normal versus tangential) and the type of strain vary with the applied stress.",
    "explanation": "This answer evaluates the way materials respond to different forms of stress: tensile stress alters length, shearing stress causes angular or lateral displacement, and hydraulic stress leads to volume changes.

    "correct_answer": "Hooke's law is limited to small deformations where the stress and strain are linearly proportional. Beyond the elastic limit, materials may enter the plastic region where deformations become permanent, and the relationship between stress and strain becomes non-linear due to effects such as yielding, hardening, or even fracture. Therefore, Hooke's law cannot predict the complex behavior in these regions.",
    "explanation": "This answer details that while Hooke's law effectively describes behavior in the elastic region, it fails when materials undergo large deformations.

This fundamental difference affects material choice in applications requiring rigidity or flexibility, and is key to understanding the behavior of materials under load.",
    "explanation": "The answer describes that modulus of elasticity (k) is directly associated with the stiffness of a material.

    "explanation": "Step 1: Compute l^3: 4^3 = 64 m^3. Step 2: Compute d^3: 0.2^3 = 0.008 m^3. Step 3: Calculate the denominator: 4 b d^3 Y = 4 x 0.1 x 0.008 x 200 x 10^9 = 0.0032 x 200 x 10^9 = 6.4 x 10^8. Step 4: The numerator is W l^3 = 1000 x 64 = 64000. Therefore, δ = 64000 / (6.4 x 10^8) = 1.0 x 10^-4 m, which is 0.1 mm.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 3 cm",
    "explanation": "Although the calculation shows that a 1 cm radius would be sufficient to just support 10 tonnes without exceeding the yield strength, in practice an additional safety margin (about a factor of ten in load) is desired. Therefore, a thicker rope with a radius of about 3 cm is recommended to ensure flexibility, strength, and safety despite the extra load.",
