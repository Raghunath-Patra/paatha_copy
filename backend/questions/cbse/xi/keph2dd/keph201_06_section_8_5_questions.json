    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Elastic moduli are critical in determining how materials deform under various types of loads. Young's modulus governs the elongation or compression behavior, shear modulus relates to shape changes under tangential forces, and bulk modulus measures resistance to volume change under pressure. For example, metals such as steel have high Young's and shear moduli, making them ideal for structural frameworks, while materials like glass and concrete, with lower moduli, are used where rigidity is not as crucial.",
    "explanation": "In structural design, selecting materials with appropriate elastic moduli ensures that deformations under load are within acceptable limits. High Young's and shear moduli imply that a material requires a large force to produce small deformations, which is essential for critical load-bearing components. Bulk modulus is important in applications where resistance to compression is vital, such as in underwater structures. The choice of material, therefore, depends on the specific requirements of stiffness, flexibility, and compressibility.",

    "correct_answer": "An experiment to determine Young's modulus can involve suspending a metal wire of known original length and cross-sectional area, applying incremental tensile loads, and measuring the corresponding elongations within the elastic limit. The stress is calculated as force divided by cross-sectional area, and the strain as the ratio of extension to original length. Young's modulus is then obtained from the slope of the stress-strain curve (Y = stress/strain). Key apparatus include a set of calibrated weights, a micrometer or dial gauge for measuring extension, a clamp to fix one end of the wire, and a device to measure the original dimensions of the wire.",
    "explanation": "The experiment involves measuring small deformations accurately; hence, precise measuring instruments are used. Data for various loads are recorded, and plotting stress versus strain yields a straight line in the elastic region. The slope of this line gives Young's modulus. This method relies on Hooke's law being valid within the elastic limit of the material.",

    "correct_answer": "Poisson's ratio is the ratio of the lateral strain (contraction in diameter) to the longitudinal strain (extension in length) in a deformed specimen. It indicates how much a material contracts laterally when stretched longitudinally. A higher Poisson's ratio means greater lateral contraction for a given longitudinal stretch, affecting the material's stability and performance under load, especially in applications where dimensional changes can impact functionality.",
    "explanation": "When a wire is stretched, not only does its length increase but its cross-sectional dimensions decrease. Poisson's ratio quantifies this relationship.
