In a three-dimensional solid, each atom vibrates in three dimensions, leading to an energy of 3 kB T per atom. For one mole, this is 3R T, so the molar specific heat at constant volume is approximately 3R.",
    "explanation": "In solids, atoms vibrate about their fixed positions. An oscillation in a single dimension contributes kB T on average (combining kinetic and potential energy). Since there are three spatial dimensions, each atom contributes 3 kB T. Multiplying by Avogadro's number gives U = 3 R T per mole. The derivative of U with respect to T, which is the specific heat, is thus 3R. This reasoning uses the law of equipartition of energy, explaining why many solids have a molar specific heat near 3R.",

    "explanation": "In the theoretical predictions, vibrational modes are neglected which results in lower values of Cv and Cp. However, in polyatomic gases like CH4, vibrational motions become active at higher temperatures and add energy (each mode contributing kB T per molecule). This increases the total internal energy and thus the specific heat. The discrepancy between theory and experiment can be attributed to the contribution of these vibrational modes, showing that more degrees of freedom are present in the real system than initially assumed.",
