Using the principle of conservation of energy, the heat lost by the solid (m × s × temperature drop) is set equal to the heat gained by the water and the calorimeter (sum of m × s × temperature rise for each component). This allows for the calculation of the unknown specific heat capacity.",
    "explanation": "The conservation of energy guarantees that in an isolated system, the heat lost by the hotter object is exactly balanced by the heat gained by the cooler objects. By carefully measuring mass and temperature changes, and using the known specific heat capacities of water and the calorimeter material, the specific heat capacity of the solid can be accurately determined using the equation: m_hot × s_hot × (T_initial_hot - T_final) = (m_water × s_water + m_calorimeter × s_calorimeter) × (T_final - T_initial_cold).",

Additionally, ensuring that all materials and instruments are calibrated properly is essential.",
