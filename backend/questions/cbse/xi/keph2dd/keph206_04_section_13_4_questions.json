    "correct_answer": "Uniform circular motion can be represented by a particle moving around a circle of radius A with constant angular speed ω. By considering the position vector OP making an angle (ωt + φ) with the positive x-axis, the x projection is obtained as x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ). This derivation comes from the definition of cosine in a right triangle, where the adjacent side (the projection on the x-axis) is given by the radius times cos(θ). Hence, the oscillatory nature of x(t) is identical to that of SHM.",
    "explanation": "The derivation stems from breaking down the position vector in circular motion into its x and y components. Since the coordinates are x = A cos(ωt + φ) and y = A sin(ωt + φ), the x coordinate follows the exact form of an SHM equation.

    "explanation": "The equation x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ) shows that φ acts as a phase shift, moving the entire waveform along the time axis.

A vertical wall placed adjacent to the circle captures the shadow of the ball. Key parameters to measure include the radius (A) of the circle, the angular speed (ω), and the period (T = 2π/ω) of the rotation. The shadow on the wall represents the x projection of the circular motion and will show SHM described by x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ).
