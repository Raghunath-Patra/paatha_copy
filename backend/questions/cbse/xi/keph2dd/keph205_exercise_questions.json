    "explanation": "First, calculate the volume of a single oxygen molecule using the sphere formula V = (4/3)πr^3 with r = 1.5 × 10^-10 m (since diameter = 3 Å). This gives about 1.41 × 10^-29 m^3 per molecule. At STP, one mole occupies 22.4 liters (0.0224 m^3) and contains approximately 6.02 × 10^23 molecules. The total molecular volume is then about 6.02 × 10^23 × 1.41 × 10^-29 m^3 ≈ 8.5 × 10^-6 m^3. The fraction is (8.5 × 10^-6 m^3) / (0.0224 m^3) ≈ 3.8 × 10^-4.",

If not, what mass of hydrogen yields the same value of PV/T (for the low-pressure, high-temperature region of the plot)? (Molecular mass of H2 = 2.02 u, O2 = 32.0 u, R = 8.31 J/mol·K.)",

    "correct_answer": "(a) The dotted plot represents the ideal gas behavior. (b) T1 < T2. (c) PV/T = nR, where n for O2 is (1.00×10^-3 kg)/(0.032 kg/mol) = 0.03125 mol, so nR ≈ 0.03125 × 8.31 ≈ 0.26 J/K. (d) For hydrogen, to have the same nR value, the required number of moles is 0.03125 mol. Since the molecular mass of H2 is 0.00202 kg/mol, the mass required is 0.03125 mol × 0.00202 kg/mol ≈ 6.3×10^-5 kg.",
    "explanation": "Part (a): The dotted line indicates the expected constant value of PV/T for an ideal gas (nR).\nPart (b): The plot description notes that T1 is below T2; hence, T1 is lower than T2.\nPart (c): Using the ideal gas law, PV/T = nR. For 1.00×10^-3 kg O2 with M = 0.032 kg/mol, n = 1.00×10^-3/0.032 ≈ 0.03125 mol. Thus, nR ≈ 0.03125 × 8.31 ≈ 0.26 J/K.\nPart (d): For hydrogen, to achieve the same PV/T value, the moles required are the same (0.03125 mol). Given M(H2) = 0.00202 kg/mol, the mass is m = 0.03125 × 0.00202 ≈ 6.3×10^-5 kg.",
