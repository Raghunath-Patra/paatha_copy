    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Surface tension creates a pressure difference across the curved interface of the liquid inside the capillary. When a capillary tube is immersed in a liquid with a contact angle less than 90°, the liquid surface becomes concave, resulting in a lower pressure at the top of the meniscus compared to the atmospheric pressure outside. This pressure difference drives the liquid upward in the tube. The capillary rise (h) is described by the equation hρg = (2S cos θ)/a, where S is the surface tension, a is the tube radius, ρ is the density of the liquid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and θ is the contact angle. This phenomenon illustrates the balance between the gravitational force and the upward force due to surface tension.",
    "explanation": "In a capillary tube, the liquid rises because the surface tension creates a curvature in the liquid surface, leading to a pressure difference. This pressure difference (derived from Laplace's law) is balanced by the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid column. The equation hρg = (2S cos θ)/a quantifies this relationship, showing how a smaller tube radius or a larger contact angle (when cos θ is positive) results in a greater capillary rise.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A soap bubble has two interfaces (inner and outer surfaces) between the liquid film and the surrounding air, so the excess pressure inside the bubble is given by ΔP = 4S/r. In contrast, a liquid drop or a hemispherical bubble (with one interface) has an excess pressure of ΔP = 2S/r. The presence of an additional interface in soap bubbles means that more work must be done against surface tension to maintain the bubble, thus requiring a higher internal pressure than in the simpler case of a drop where only one interface exists.",
    "explanation": "In a soap bubble, the liquid film is bounded by air on both sides, doubling the effect of surface tension. Therefore, the excess pressure inside is determined by the formula ΔP = 4S/r. For a drop, only one surface is in contact with air, leading to ΔP = 2S/r. This difference explains why soap bubbles need a higher internal pressure to remain stable compared to liquid drops.",
