    "correct_answer": "An equilibrium state in thermodynamics is defined by uniform macroscopic properties like temperature and pressure throughout the system. In cases such as free expansion, the gas initially has non-uniform pressure until equilibrium is reached. Similarly, during an explosive chemical reaction, rapid changes lead to non-uniform temperature and pressure distributions until the reaction products settle into a uniform state.",
    "explanation": "Uniform temperature and pressure are crucial for an equilibrium state because thermodynamic state variables are defined only when these properties are uniform. In free expansion, immediately after removing the partition, the gas does not have equal pressure throughout, making it a non-equilibrium state until uniformity is achieved. In explosive reactions, the rapid formation of gases leads to temporary non-equilibrium conditions that eventually stabilize into equilibrium. This uniformity allows for the accurate use of equations like the ideal gas law and the application of energy conservation principles.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The consistency of thermodynamic equations can be checked by ensuring that both sides of an equation have the same classification of variables. In the equation ΔQ = ΔU + PΔV, ΔQ and ΔU are extensive, and even though P is intensive, when it multiplies the extensive ΔV, the resulting product is extensive. This matching of extensive properties on both sides of the equation confirms its consistency.",
    "explanation": "Thermodynamic equations must be dimensionally and conceptually consistent. By classifying variables as intensive or extensive, one can check that equations make sense. For example, ΔQ (heat added) and ΔU (change in internal energy) are extensive variables. The term PΔV involves pressure (an intensive variable) multiplied by a volume change (an extensive variable), which yields an extensive result. Thus, the equation remains consistently extensive on both sides, verifying its physical validity.",
