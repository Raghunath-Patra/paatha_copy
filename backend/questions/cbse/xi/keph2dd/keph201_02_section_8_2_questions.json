    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a material is deformed by an external force, internal restoring forces develop to oppose the deformation, attempting to return the body to its original shape and size. For tensile stress, these restoring forces work against the elongation; in shearing stress, they counteract the sliding displacement between layers; and in hydraulic stress, they oppose the uniform compression. Each case illustrates how materials behave under different deformation conditions and how internal forces maintain equilibrium.",
    "explanation": "The restoring force is a result of the material’s elastic properties. In tensile stress, the force is distributed along the length causing an elongation with a corresponding strain ΔL/L. In shearing stress, a displacement of Δx between the surfaces leads to a shearing strain Δx/L, approximated by tanθ for small angles. In hydraulic compression, the uniform pressure results in a volume strain ΔV/V. Understanding these responses is key in analyzing material strength and elasticity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Shearing stress is produced when equal and opposite forces are applied tangentially to the faces of a cylinder, causing the layers to slide relative to each other. The deformation is characterized by a displacement Δx between the faces over the original length L, defined as the shearing strain (Δx/L). Additionally, this displacement results in an angular deformation of the cylinder, where tanθ is used to express the angle. For small angles, tanθ approximates θ, directly relating the shearing strain to the angular deformation in radians.",
    "explanation": "When a tangential force is applied, the material layers shift, and the change in shape is quantified by the shearing strain. The relationship Δx/L = tanθ simplifies to Δx/L ≈ θ for small angles, making it easier to calculate the angular displacement. This analysis is essential in understanding material behavior under shear loads.",
