Its significance lies in demonstrating that for an ideal gas at constant temperature, the work done depends logarithmically on the ratio of the final and initial volumes and is directly proportional to the temperature and number of moles.",
    "explanation": "Starting with ΔW = P ΔV and using the ideal gas law to substitute for P, the integration of dV/V leads to the natural logarithm function. This derivation underscores the idea that in an isothermal process, the internal energy of an ideal gas remains constant; hence, any heat absorbed is converted entirely into work.

    "correct_answer": "To calculate the work done by the gas during an adiabatic process, one starts with the equation P V^(γ) = constant. The work is given by W = ∫P dV, substituting P from the adiabatic relation. After expressing the constant in terms of initial or final states, integration gives an expression for work in terms of volumes and pressures or temperatures. Finally, using the relation W = (μR (T1 - T2))/(γ - 1), one can find the work based on initial and final temperatures.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with the understanding that in an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged. Since P V^(γ) = constant, express P = constant/V^(γ) and substitute into the work integral. The integration yields an expression that connects volume and pressure differences. Using the ideal gas law further connects the result to temperature change, resulting in the formula W = (μR (T1 - T2))/(γ - 1). This formula indicates that if the gas does work (expands), its temperature drops; if work is done on the gas, its temperature increases.",

Each process differs in how they exchange heat, change work, and influence internal energy.",
    "explanation": "In an isothermal process, the system remains at a constant temperature so that the change in internal energy is zero, and according to Boyle's law the product PV is constant. In adiabatic processes, the system is insulated (ΔQ = 0), leading the work done to come solely from the internal energy change; the pressure and volume are related by P V^(γ)= constant. Isochoric processes involve no change in volume, resulting in zero work, and any heat added increases the internal energy directly. In isobaric processes, pressure remains constant and the work is directly proportional to the change in volume (W = P(V2 - V1)) with associated changes in both internal energy and temperature.
