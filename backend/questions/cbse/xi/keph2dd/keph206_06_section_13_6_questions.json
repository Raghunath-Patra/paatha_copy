Applying Newton's second law, F = m a, we obtain F = -m ω² x(t). This derivation shows that the force is proportional to the negative of the displacement, hence always directed toward the equilibrium position. Differentiation is key here because it transforms the displacement function into acceleration, thereby linking kinematics with dynamics.",

The net force becomes F = -kx (left) - kx (right) = -2kx. This net force shows that the effective spring constant is 2k. The period of oscillation for a mass-spring system is given by T = 2π √(m/k_eff). With k_eff = 2k, the period is T = 2π √(m/2k), demonstrating that an increase in the effective spring constant reduces the period of oscillation.",

In contrast, starting from the force equation F = -m ω² x, one must integrate twice to recover the displacement function x(t). Both approaches assume that the restoring force is linearly proportional to the displacement, which is a core assumption of simple harmonic motion. The process of differentiation emphasizes the direct relationship between kinematics and dynamics, while integration requires knowledge of initial conditions to fully characterize the motion. Each method highlights different aspects of the system dynamics, with differentiation being more straightforward in linking forces and motion, and integration emphasizing the cumulative effect of force over time.",
