    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The incorrect figure is the one that does not satisfy either the continuity equation or Bernoulli's principle.",
    "explanation": "In steady, non-viscous flow, both the continuity equation and Bernoulli's principle must hold along a streamline. The figure that depicts inconsistent pressure distributions or incorrect variations in cross-sectional velocities violates these fundamental principles and is therefore incorrect.",

    "question_text": "The cylindrical tube of a spray pump has a cross-section of 8.0 cm^2, one end of which has 40 fine holes each of diameter 1.0 mm. If the liquid flow inside the tube is 1.5 m/min, what is the speed of ejection of the liquid through the holes?",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 0.64 m/s",
    "explanation": "First, convert the tube cross-sectional area: 8.0 cm^2 = 8.0 x 10^-4 m^2. The flow velocity inside is 1.5 m/min, which is 0.025 m/s. The volumetric flow rate in the tube is Q = 0.025 m/s x 8.0 x 10^-4 m^2 = 2.0 x 10^-5 m^3/s. The total area of the 40 holes is 40 x (π x (0.0005 m)^2) ≈ 3.14 x 10^-5 m^2. By continuity, the ejection speed is V_exit = Q / (total hole area) ≈ (2.0 x 10^-5) / (3.14 x 10^-5) ≈ 0.64 m/s.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The weight supported is proportional to the total length along which the surface tension acts. If the film in configuration (b) or (c) is arranged to have a greater effective perimeter compared to (a), then it will support a correspondingly larger weight—for example, if the effective length is doubled, the supported weight will also double.",
    "explanation": "The force due to surface tension is given by F = 2S x L, where L is the total length along which the film is in contact. In different configurations, the effective boundary length changes. Thus, if a film in configuration (b) has the same effective length as in (a), it will support the same weight; if configuration (c) has a doubled effective length, it can support twice the weight. Without specific dimensions from the figures, the answer is expressed in proportional terms.",

    "explanation": "For a liquid drop, the excess pressure (ΔP) is given by 2S/r. Here, S = 0.465 N/m and r = 0.003 m, so ΔP ≈ (2 × 0.465) / 0.003 ≈ 310 Pa. Adding this to the atmospheric pressure (1.01 x 10^5 Pa) gives an absolute internal pressure of approximately 1.0131 x 10^5 Pa.",

    "type": "Numerical",

    "correct_answer": "The excess pressure inside the bubble is approximately 20 Pa. At 40.0 cm depth in a soap solution (density 1200 kg/m^3), the external pressure is about 1.057 x 10^5 Pa, so the pressure inside the bubble is approximately 1.0572 x 10^5 Pa.",
    "explanation": "For a soap bubble, which has two surfaces, the excess pressure is given by ΔP = 4S/r. With S = 0.025 N/m and r = 0.005 m, ΔP = (4 × 0.025) / 0.005 = 20 Pa. For a bubble at a depth of 40 cm in a liquid of density 1200 kg/m^3, the hydrostatic pressure is ρgh = 1200 x 9.8 x 0.40 ≈ 4704 Pa. Adding the atmospheric pressure (1.01 x 10^5 Pa) gives an external pressure of approximately 1.057 x 10^5 Pa. Thus, the internal pressure is external pressure plus the excess pressure, roughly 1.0572 x 10^5 Pa.",
