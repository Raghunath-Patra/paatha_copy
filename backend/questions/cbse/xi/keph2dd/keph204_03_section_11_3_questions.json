Replacing the adiabatic wall with a conducting wall does not cause any net heat flow because there is no temperature gradient between A and B, so their state remains unchanged.",
    "explanation": "The key idea is that heat flows only when there is a temperature difference.

This allows us to define temperature as the property that is equal for systems in equilibrium. By establishing a common variable (temperature), it becomes possible to construct a numerical scale for temperature measurement, which is crucial for thermometry and the consistent description of thermal phenomena.",
    "explanation": "The development of the concept of temperature is rooted in the observation described in the section: if system A and system B are separately in equilibrium with system C, then A and B must have the same temperature.

    "correct_answer": "An experimental setup involves three systems: A, B, and C. Initially, A and B are isolated from each other by an adiabatic wall but are both in thermal contact with system C through conducting walls. Over time, A and C, and separately B and C, exchange heat until they achieve the same temperature. Once both A and B have reached thermal equilibrium with C, replacing the adiabatic wall between A and B with a conducting wall does not result in any temperature change, confirming that A and B are already in equilibrium with each other.",
    "explanation": "The experiment begins by ensuring that systems A and B are influenced only by system C. When isolated from each other by an adiabatic barrier, any observed change in macroscopic variables results only from their interaction with C. Once equilibrium is reached and the barrier is replaced by a conducting one, the lack of further change in the states of A and B confirms that they were in equilibrium, thus verifying the Zeroth Law.",
