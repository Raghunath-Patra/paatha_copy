    "correct_answer": "Standing waves are formed due to the superposition of two identical waves traveling in opposite directions. In a stretched string fixed at both ends, a wave traveling towards one end is reflected with a phase change of 180 degrees when it reaches the rigid boundary. The incident and reflected waves interfere, forming a pattern where at fixed positions (nodes) the displacement is always zero and at other positions (antinodes) the displacement reaches a maximum. The separation between successive nodes is half the wavelength. This interference pattern remains stationary, even though individual points on the string oscillate.",
    "explanation": "The answer describes the formation of standing waves as a result of superposition of the incident and reflected waves. The fixed boundary forces a node leading to a phase change, and the resulting interference pattern is characterized by fixed nodes and antinodes.

    "correct_answer": "For a string fixed at both ends, the boundary conditions require that both ends are nodes. This implies that the distance between two consecutive nodes is λ/2. Therefore, for a string of length L with n half-wavelengths fitting exactly into L, we have L = n(λ/2), where n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). Rearranging gives λ = 2L/n.",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins with the observation that a node must exist at each fixed end. Since the distance between nodes in a standing wave is half the wavelength, the entire length L must be an integer multiple of λ/2. By solving L = n(λ/2) for λ, we obtain the expression for the allowed wavelengths. This derivation uses basic principles of standing waves and boundary conditions.",

    "correct_answer": "Normal modes in air columns result in standing wave patterns that have discrete frequencies, which are determined by the boundary conditions of the pipe. For an open pipe, all harmonics are present, whereas for a pipe with one end closed, only odd harmonics can be formed. This means that an organ can be designed to produce a rich spectrum of sounds by carefully choosing the dimensions of the pipes so that the desired fundamental frequency and its harmonics are produced. The predictable nature of these modes allows instrument makers to design pipes to resonate at specific natural frequencies, thus creating the desired pitches.",
    "explanation": "The response elaborates on the effect of boundary conditions on the harmonic content of the sound produced by air columns.

    "explanation": "Nodes and antinodes are defined by the amplitude of oscillation. For nodes, the superposition leads to zero displacement; for antinodes, the maximum displacement occurs. This is directly derived from the standing wave equation y(x, t) = 2a sin(kx) cos(ωt).",

Their constructive and destructive interference at different points leads to fixed points of zero displacement (nodes) and points of maximum displacement (antinodes), forming a standing wave.",

    "correct_answer": "One key difference is the boundary conditions: a string fixed at both ends has nodes at both boundaries, whereas an air column with one end closed has a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end. A second difference is the harmonic content: the string supports all harmonics (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), while the air column with one end closed supports only odd harmonics (n = 0, 1, 2, ... corresponding to frequencies of 1, 3, 5 times the fundamental frequency).",
    "explanation": "The answer correctly identifies that the differences in boundary conditions directly influence the formation of nodes and antinodes, which in turn affect the type of harmonics produced.
