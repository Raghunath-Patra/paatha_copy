    "explanation": "The displacement function x(t) = A cos(ωt + ϕ) has its maximum at t = 0 when ϕ = 0. The velocity function, being the derivative, becomes v(t) = -ωA sin(ωt + ϕ) and thus leads or lags the displacement by π/2. Acceleration, given by a(t) = -ω²A cos(ωt + ϕ), is exactly out of phase (by π) with the displacement, meaning when displacement is maximum, acceleration is maximum in the opposite direction.

    "correct_answer": "False",
    "explanation": "When displacement is zero in SHM, the acceleration is not zero; in fact, the velocity is maximum there and the acceleration is zero only at the moment of maximum displacement (with opposite sign). However, according to a(t) = -ω²x(t), if x(t)=0, then a(t) is zero. But note that at zero displacement, while acceleration is zero, this statement often is confused with the fact that the restoring force (and hence the acceleration) is highest at maximum displacement. Therefore, the proper reasoning is: at zero displacement, the acceleration is zero but maximum acceleration occurs at maximum displacement. Considering the common misconception, this statement can be misleading. In this context, since a(t) = -ω²x(t), at x = 0, acceleration is indeed zero. Thus, the statement is True. However, due to conflicting intuitions, clearly state the correct reasoning: a(t)=0 when x=0.",
