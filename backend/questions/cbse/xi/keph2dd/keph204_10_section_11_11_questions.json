Each process is carried out reversibly, meaning the system remains in equilibrium at all times, thereby ensuring maximum efficiency. The significance of the Carnot cycle is that it sets the upper limit on the efficiency achievable by any heat engine, with the maximum efficiency given by η = 1 - (T₂/T₁), independent of the working substance.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Carnot’s theorem states that no heat engine operating between two given temperatures can be more efficient than a reversible Carnot engine. This is because any engine that claims higher efficiency would violate the second law of thermodynamics, as demonstrated by coupling an irreversible engine with a reversible refrigerator and obtaining net work by extracting heat from a single reservoir. Consequently, efficiency is limited to 1 - (T₂/T₁) regardless of the working substance. The theorem underscores the fundamental limit imposed by the second law and guides engineers to focus on reducing irreversibilities rather than attempting to exceed the Carnot efficiency.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains Carnot's theorem in the context of the second law of thermodynamics. It discusses how irreversible processes lead to lower efficiency and that any claim of higher efficiency would result in a violation of established thermodynamic principles.
