    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Laplace correction modifies Newton's formula by recognizing that sound waves propagate so rapidly that the compressions and rarefactions are adiabatic. This correction replaces P in Newton’s original formula with γP (where γ is the ratio of specific heats), resulting in v = √(γP/ρ) instead of v = √(P/ρ). This change accounts for the additional pressure increase during adiabatic compression, bringing the theoretical speed of sound closer to experimentally observed values.",
    "explanation": "Newton originally assumed that the pressure variations during sound propagation were isothermal, which led to an underestimation of the speed of sound. Laplace pointed out that the rapid process does not allow time for heat exchange, making it adiabatic. Under adiabatic conditions, the effective bulk modulus is increased by a factor of γ. This correction leads to the revised expression v = √(γP/ρ) and results in a speed of sound value that better matches experimental measurements, such as the value of approximately 331 m/s in air at STP.",
