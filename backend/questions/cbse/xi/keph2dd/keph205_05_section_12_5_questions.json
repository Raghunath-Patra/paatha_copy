For a diatomic molecule, there are 3 translational degrees, contributing 3/2 kB T. Additionally, there are 2 rotational degrees which contribute kB T in total. If the molecule can vibrate, it has one vibrational mode that contributes an extra kB T (since it has both kinetic and potential energy terms).

Consequently, when calculating thermodynamic properties such as specific heat, the total number of quadratic terms directly influences the energy capacity of the substance.",
    "explanation": "The equipartition theorem asserts that every degree of freedom represented by a quadratic term in the energy adds 1/2 kB T (or 1/2 kB T per kinetic and potential part in vibrations).
