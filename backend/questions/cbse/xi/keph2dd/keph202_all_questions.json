    "explanation": "First, convert 960 km/h to m/s: 960*(1000/3600) ≈ 267 m/s. The weight of the airplane is 3.3×10^5 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 3.234×10^6 N. This weight is balanced by the lift produced over an area of 500 m², so the pressure difference ΔP = 3.234×10^6 N / 500 m² ≈ 6468 N/m², or approximately 6500 N/m².",

The setup would include a motorized plate connected to the sample with a sensor to measure shear force. The variables to be controlled are temperature, sample size, and initial conditions. For the solid, the minimal shear stress required for deformation would be recorded, while for the fluid, the shear stress at which it begins to flow significantly would be measured. Expected outcomes include a much lower shear stress threshold for the fluid compared to the solid. Error analysis would involve repeating the experiment multiple times, calibrating the sensor, and accounting for any variations in temperature or mechanical vibrations. Improvements might include isolating the apparatus from external vibrations and refining the sensor sensitivity.",

When the tube is inverted into a mercury trough, the mercury falls until the weight of the mercury column balances the atmospheric pressure. The height of the mercury column is proportional to the atmospheric pressure, and a typical height of 76 cm corresponds to about 1 atmosphere. The pressure is calculated using the formula P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of mercury, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the column.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hydraulic lifts operate on Pascal’s law, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted uniformly throughout the fluid. When an input force F1 is applied on a piston with area A1, it creates a pressure P equal to F1/A1. This same pressure is transmitted to a larger piston with area A2, which then exerts an output force F2 = P × A2 = (F1/A1) × A2. Thus, the force is amplified by a factor of A2/A1. This system enables heavy loads to be lifted with relatively little input force, making it both efficient and effective in applications such as car lifts and hydraulic brakes.",

When a capillary tube is immersed in a liquid with a contact angle less than 90°, the liquid surface becomes concave, resulting in a lower pressure at the top of the meniscus compared to the atmospheric pressure outside. This pressure difference drives the liquid upward in the tube. The capillary rise (h) is described by the equation hρg = (2S cos θ)/a, where S is the surface tension, a is the tube radius, ρ is the density of the liquid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and θ is the contact angle. This phenomenon illustrates the balance between the gravitational force and the upward force due to surface tension.",

This pressure difference (derived from Laplace's law) is balanced by the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid column.

In contrast, a liquid drop or a hemispherical bubble (with one interface) has an excess pressure of ΔP = 2S/r. The presence of an additional interface in soap bubbles means that more work must be done against surface tension to maintain the bubble, thus requiring a higher internal pressure than in the simpler case of a drop where only one interface exists.",
    "explanation": "In a soap bubble, the liquid film is bounded by air on both sides, doubling the effect of surface tension. Therefore, the excess pressure inside is determined by the formula ΔP = 4S/r. For a drop, only one surface is in contact with air, leading to ΔP = 2S/r.

This is because the intermolecular forces are overcome more readily at higher temperatures.

Here, a = 1.5 mm = 0.0015 m, υ = 0.04 m/s, ρ = 6000 kg/m^3, σ = 1200 kg/m^3, and g = 9.8 m/s^2. Compute (ρ - σ) = 6000 - 1200 = 4800 kg/m^3. Then, a^2 = (0.0015)^2 = 2.25×10^-6 m^2. Now, numerator = 2 * 2.25×10^-6 * 4800 * 9.8 = 2 * 2.25×10^-6 * 47040 ≈ 2 * 0.10584 = 0.21168. Denom = 9 * 0.04 = 0.36. So, η = 0.21168 / 0.36 ≈ 0.588 kg/(m·s). This value does not match the expected answer; rechecking calculations: 2.25×10^-6 * 4800 = 0.0108, multiplied by 9.8 gives 0.10584, multiplied by 2 gives 0.21168, divided by 0.36 gives approximately 0.588. Thus, the viscosity is approximately 0.59 kg/(m·s). (Note: The computed answer is 0.59 kg/(m·s), which is accepted based on the provided values.)",
