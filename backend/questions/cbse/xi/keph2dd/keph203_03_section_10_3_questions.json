These known physical phenomena provide exact benchmarks from which the linear temperature scales are constructed. By linking the thermometer readings to these universally accepted values, any measurement can be accurately interpreted in either scale.",
    "explanation": "The fixed reference points are chosen because they occur under standard conditions and are easy to reproduce in experiments.

    "correct_answer": "An experiment to verify the linearity can be designed by measuring the temperature of water at various known melting and boiling points, as well as intermediate values. The procedure would involve: 1) Preparing water samples at predetermined temperatures using a temperature-controlled bath; 2) Recording the thermometer readings in both Celsius and Fahrenheit; 3) Plotting t°F against t°C to observe linearity. Control variables include maintaining standard pressure and using pure water. Possible sources of error include imperfections in the thermometer, delayed response times, and inconsistent thermal equilibrium.",
    "explanation": "The experiment requires careful control of external conditions to ensure that the only variable affecting temperature is the actual thermal energy. The steps include calibration checks at the ice and steam points and additional points in between. Data plotting should yield a straight line if the relationship is truly linear.
