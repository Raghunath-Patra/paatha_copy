    "correct_answer": "The study of elastic behaviour influences design by enabling engineers to predict how materials will respond to loads and stresses. For example, in bridge design, knowing the elasticity of steel helps in calculating load distributions and ensuring the structure can safely handle stress without undergoing plastic deformation. Similarly, in building construction, elastic properties determine how much sway a building can tolerate during wind or seismic activity. Engineers consider factors like stress, strain, and the modulus of elasticity to design structures that are both safe and efficient.",
    "explanation": "In this answer, students are expected to integrate knowledge about elasticity, stress, strain, and material properties.

    "correct_answer": "Differentiating between elastic and plastic deformations is significant because it helps engineers design objects that not only perform optimally under regular operating conditions but also ensure safety under unexpected loads. For instance, car components must handle collisions without undergoing permanent deformation, while artificial limbs require materials that can both withstand daily stresses and recover from temporary impacts. Recognizing the limits of elastic behaviour allows for optimal material selection and design strategies that balance strength, flexibility, and durability.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The distribution of mass affects how forces generate bending moments, compressive stresses, and strains in different parts of the body. In an ideal rigid body, mass distribution is often ignored, but in real objects, variations in mass distribution can lead to uneven deformation. This consideration is critical in design because it determines the structural integrity and performance under load. For example, in cantilever beams or I-shaped railway tracks, non-uniform mass distribution must be accounted for to predict where maximum stresses occur and how the material will respond under various loading scenarios.",
    "explanation": "A thorough answer should include discussion on how localized mass concentrations can lead to higher stress intensities and potential failure points. Reference should be made to bending and torsional effects, and how these phenomena differ from the simplified case of a rigid body.
