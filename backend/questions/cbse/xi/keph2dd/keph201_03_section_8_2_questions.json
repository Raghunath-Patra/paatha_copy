    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A material subjected to external forces develops internal restoring forces that counteract the applied forces. When forces are applied normal to a cross-sectional area, tensile or compressive stress is produced, leading to longitudinal strain (ΔL/L). When forces are applied tangentially, they produce shearing stress, causing shearing strain (Δx/L or tanθ), which is associated with an angular displacement. In hydraulic compression, a uniform force is applied perpendicular to all surfaces of an object, creating hydraulic stress and resulting in a volume strain (ΔV/V), with the shape remaining almost unchanged.",
    "explanation": "This comprehensive response explains that the type of stress and corresponding strain depend on how the forces are applied.

The shearing strain is defined as Δx divided by the length L of the cylinder, which is also represented as tanθ, where θ is the angular displacement. For small angles, tanθ is approximately equal to θ, providing the relationship: Shearing Strain = Δx/L ≈ θ.",
    "explanation": "The derivation starts by defining the shearing strain as the ratio of the displacement (Δx) to the original length (L) of the cylinder. Since the deformation causes the cylinder to rotate slightly, this relative displacement forms an angle θ. Given that for small θ, tanθ is nearly equal to θ, the expression simplifies to shearing strain being approximately equal to θ when measured in radians.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In tensile stress cases, the material develops a restoring force per unit area that counteracts any elongation or compression along the length (longitudinal strain). Under shearing stress, adjacent layers of material slide relative to each other, and the restoring force similarly works to return these layers to their original positions (shearing strain). In hydraulic stress, the force is applied uniformly, and although the shape remains mostly unchanged, the volume decreases; here the restoring force per unit area is equivalent to the hydraulic pressure. In all cases, the internal forces develop to undo the deformation, but the nature of the force (normal versus tangential) and the type of strain vary with the applied stress.",
    "explanation": "This answer evaluates the way materials respond to different forms of stress: tensile stress alters length, shearing stress causes angular or lateral displacement, and hydraulic stress leads to volume changes. The explanation emphasizes that regardless of the deformation type, the material develops a corresponding restoring force, which is directly related to the specific mode of deformation.",
