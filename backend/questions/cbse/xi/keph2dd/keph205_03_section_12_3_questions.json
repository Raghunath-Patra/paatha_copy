    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Real gases deviate from ideal behavior under high pressures and low temperatures because the assumptions of negligible molecular interactions and the large distances between molecules break down. At high pressures, molecules are closer together, and attractive or repulsive forces become significant, while at low temperatures, the kinetic energy of molecules decreases, making intermolecular forces more apparent.",
    "explanation": "Figures in the text show that at high pressures and lower temperatures, the experimental curves for real gases differ from the ideal gas isotherms, indicating the onset of interactions.

    "correct_answer": "An expression for the density of an ideal gas can be derived by rearranging P = (ρRT)/M₀ to ρ = (P M₀)/(RT). This shows that the density ρ is directly proportional to the pressure P and the molar mass M₀, and inversely proportional to the temperature T. Therefore, for a fixed molar mass, increasing the pressure increases the density while increasing the temperature decreases the density.",
    "explanation": "Starting from P = (ρRT)/M₀, we solve for ρ giving ρ = (P M₀)/(RT). This relationship clearly indicates that if the pressure rises, molecules are compressed into a smaller volume (increasing density), and if the temperature rises, the molecules spread out (decreasing density). This fundamental derivation is applicable for ideal gases and helps explain the behavior of gases under different conditions.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In liquid water, the molecules are closely packed; thus, nearly the entire volume is occupied by the water molecules. However, in water vapor at 100°C and 1 atm, the density is much lower (0.6 kg/m³) than that of liquid water (1000 kg/m³), indicating that the molecules are far apart. The ratio of the volume of a molecule to the total volume in the vapor state is about 6×10⁻⁴, showing that only a small fraction of the vapor’s volume is actually occupied by the molecules. This analysis highlights the significant increase in intermolecular spacing when water transitions from a liquid to a gaseous state.",
    "explanation": "The text explains that in water vapor, the density is 0.6 kg/m³ compared to 1000 kg/m³ in liquid water. This difference means that the volume available per molecule in the vapor phase is much larger. Using the estimated molecular volume from the example (approximately 3×10⁻²⁹ m³), one can compare it with the total available volume per molecule in the gas phase, leading to the conclusion that the fractional occupied volume is extremely small.",
