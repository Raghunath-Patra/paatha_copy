    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A stress-strain curve provides a graphical representation of how a material responds to stress and strain, indicating various properties such as elastic limit, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and fracture point. Brittle materials typically show a small plastic region with the ultimate tensile strength and fracture points being very close, indicating limited deformation before breaking. Ductile materials, on the other hand, exhibit a significant plastic region where the material deforms plastically before fracture, allowing for energy absorption and significant shape changes prior to failure.",
    "explanation": "The stress-strain curve is essential in materials science as it summarizes key mechanical properties. Brittle materials have steep curves that end abruptly, while ductile materials show an extended region of plastic deformation. Evaluating these differences helps engineers choose the right material for specific applications, balancing strength with the ability to absorb energy through plastic deformation.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Elastomers, like rubber and aortic tissue, can undergo very large strains and still return to their original shape, but they do not obey Hooke's law over most of the strain range, and do not display a well-defined plastic region. This behavior is due to their molecular structure, which allows for significant uncoiling and reorientation of polymer chains under stress. Metals, in contrast, have a defined elastic region where Hooke's law applies and a clear yield point marking the onset of plastic deformation, resulting from dislocation movement within a crystalline structure.",
    "explanation": "Elastomers have long-chain polymer molecules that are highly flexible and can extend considerably. Their non-linear stress-strain behavior is a result of the gradual alignment of these chains under load, rather than the uniform, linear response seen in metals. Metals, with their atomic lattice structure, initially behave elastically until the stress exceeds the yield point, after which permanent deformation occurs. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting materials for applications requiring high flexibility or high strength.",
