For two harmonic waves, y1 = a sin(kx - ωt) and y2 = a sin(kx - ωt + φ), the resultant wave is given by y = 2a cos(φ/2) sin(kx - ωt + φ/2). This shows that the amplitude of the resultant wave depends on the phase difference φ, achieving maximum amplitude 2a when φ = 0 and complete cancellation when φ = π.",
    "explanation": "The principle is derived from the linearity of the wave equation. By using the trigonometric identity for sin A + sin B, the resultant wave is expressed as y = 2a cos(φ/2) sin(kx - ωt + φ/2). This formula illustrates how the phase difference modifies the amplitude and phase of the resultant wave. When φ = 0, cos(0)=1, and the amplitude doubles, representing constructive interference.

    "explanation": "For two waves y1 = a sin(kx - ωt) and y2 = a sin(kx - ωt + φ), applying the superposition principle gives y = a sin(kx - ωt) + a sin(kx - ωt + φ). Using the trigonometric identity results in y = 2a cos(φ/2) sin(kx - ωt + φ/2). For φ = 0 (in phase), cos(0)=1, hence y = 2a sin(kx - ωt), which represents constructive interference. For φ = π (completely out of phase), cos(π/2)=0, hence y = 0, which represents destructive interference.
