    "correct_answer": "Kinetic theory is consistent with gas laws because it provides a molecular-level explanation for phenomena such as Boyle's law, Charles's law, and Avogadro's hypothesis. For instance, Avogadro's hypothesis postulates that gases at the same temperature and pressure contain an equal number of molecules, which aligns with the idea that pressure is due to countless individual molecular collisions. Furthermore, by relating molecular motion to energy, kinetic theory explains the specific heat capacities of gases, and by analyzing properties like viscosity and diffusion, it offers estimates for molecular sizes and masses.",
    "explanation": "The answer should include how kinetic theory underpins the gas laws by correlating molecular motion with pressure, volume and temperature. It should highlight the role of the equipartition of energy in explaining specific heat capacities and use examples such as Avogadro's hypothesis to illustrate how molecular counts relate to observable gas behavior. Additionally, the answer should mention how physical properties like viscosity and diffusion provide insight into molecular dimensions.",
