Another sequence is to change the pressure first at constant volume, reaching (P2, V1), then vary the volume at constant pressure to (P2, V2). The change in internal energy remains the same because it is a state function, i.e., it depends only on the initial and final states, not on the path taken.",
    "explanation": "The internal energy is a state variable, meaning that regardless of the sequence of volume and pressure changes, the net change (Delta U) depends solely on the difference between the final and initial states.

    "correct_answer": "In an isothermal expansion, the temperature and thus the internal energy of an ideal gas remain constant (Delta U = 0).

This means that the energy added as heat is entirely used to overcome the external pressure during expansion.",

Thus, the First Law (Delta Q = Delta U + Delta W) simplifies, allowing us to conclude that every joule of heat added translates directly into performing work.
