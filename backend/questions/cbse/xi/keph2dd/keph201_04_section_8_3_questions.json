    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hooke's law is limited to small deformations where the stress and strain are linearly proportional. Beyond the elastic limit, materials may enter the plastic region where deformations become permanent, and the relationship between stress and strain becomes non-linear due to effects such as yielding, hardening, or even fracture. Therefore, Hooke's law cannot predict the complex behavior in these regions.",
    "explanation": "This answer details that while Hooke's law effectively describes behavior in the elastic region, it fails when materials undergo large deformations. In the non-elastic or plastic region, permanent deformation occurs and the linear proportionality no longer holds, making models like plasticity theory necessary.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A higher modulus of elasticity indicates that a material is stiffer, so even a small strain results in a relatively high stress. Conversely, a lower k implies a more compliant material which deforms more easily under applied stress. This fundamental difference affects material choice in applications requiring rigidity or flexibility, and is key to understanding the behavior of materials under load.",
    "explanation": "The answer describes that modulus of elasticity (k) is directly associated with the stiffness of a material. A high k means the material requires greater stress to achieve the same level of strain, indicating stiffness, whereas a low k suggests greater elasticity. This characteristic is critical in engineering applications where material behavior under load must be precisely controlled.",
