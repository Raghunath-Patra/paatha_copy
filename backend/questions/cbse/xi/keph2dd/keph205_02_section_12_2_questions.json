    "correct_answer": "In solids, atoms are closely packed (around a few angstroms apart) producing strong interatomic forces and a rigid structure. In liquids, atoms remain close but are more mobile, allowing flow. In gases, the large interatomic distances (tens to thousands of angstroms) allow molecules to move freely, resulting in compression and diffusion properties.",

    "correct_answer": "The transition from early atomic hypotheses, which were largely philosophical and speculative, to modern atomic theory marks a significant improvement in our understanding of matter. Early theories like those of Kanada and Democritus correctly intuited the existence of tiny, indivisible particles, but lacked empirical evidence and quantitative analysis. With Dalton, measurement and experimentation began to underpin the concept, providing concrete explanation for phenomena such as definite and multiple proportions. Later discoveries, such as electron microscopy, further refined our understanding by revealing subatomic structure and the dynamic nature of atoms and molecules. Limitations of early ideas included the inability to observe and measure atomic properties, whereas modern methods allow scientists to accurately determine atomic sizes, molecular compositions, and interatomic forces.",

    "explanation": "The interatomic distance of around 30 angstroms in gases indicates some interaction but the much larger mean free path (approx. 1000 angstroms) means that molecules move freely over longer distances before colliding with another molecule.
