    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The equation of continuity, expressed as A·v = constant, is critical in the design of piping systems for incompressible fluids as it ensures that the volumetric flow rate remains constant throughout the system. This implies that when a pipe's cross-sectional area decreases, the fluid velocity must increase, which often leads to a decrease in pressure (as explained by Bernoulli’s principle) in horizontal flows. Understanding these relationships is essential for designing pipes that avoid excessive velocities which could cause erosion or pressure drops that may affect system performance.",
    "explanation": "The continuity equation ensures mass conservation in fluid dynamics. When fluid flows through pipes of varying cross-sectional areas, the design must account for resulting velocity changes which can influence pressure and energy losses.

In contrast, turbulent flow is marked by chaotic fluid motion, eddies, and vortices, and is common in high-speed flows or around obstacles, like in atmospheric clouds or water flowing in rapids. Both have distinct impacts on energy losses and pressure distribution in engineering applications.",

    "correct_answer": "When fluid flows from a wider pipe into a narrower one, the continuity equation (A1v1 = A2v2) dictates that the velocity must increase as the cross-sectional area decreases. This acceleration results in a reduction in static pressure in the narrower section, assuming horizontal flow and negligible friction. The analysis assumes that the fluid is incompressible, the flow is steady, and viscous effects are minimal.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains that conservation of mass requires an increase in velocity for reduced cross-sectional areas. A corresponding decrease in pressure is predicted by Bernoulli’s principle, provided other energy losses are insignificant.
