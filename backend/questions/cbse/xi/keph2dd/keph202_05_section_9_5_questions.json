    "explanation": "At the start, the sphere accelerates under gravity. As velocity increases, the drag force (proportional to the velocity) increases until it, together with the buoyant force, balances the gravitational pull. At this point, net force is zero, and the sphere falls with a constant terminal velocity (v_t). This balance of forces leads directly to the equation 6πηav_t = (4π/3)a^3(ρ - σ)g.

In contrast, for gases, an increase in temperature leads to higher viscosity, as the increased molecular motion enhances momentum transfer between layers.",
    "explanation": "Liquids such as water, honey, and oil have viscosities that typically decrease with increasing temperature, as seen in the table (for example, water at 20°C has a higher viscosity than at 100°C). This is because the intermolecular forces are overcome more readily at higher temperatures. For gases, however, higher temperatures lead to more vigorous molecular collisions and a more effective momentum exchange, increasing the resistance to flow. This fundamental difference arises from the nature of intermolecular interactions in liquids versus the more kinetic behavior of gas molecules.",

Plugging in these values: η = (0.4 N * 0.0005 m) / (0.08 m/s * 0.2 m^2) = (0.0002) / (0.016) = 0.0125 Ns/m^2.

Using the relation η = (F * l) / (v * A), we get: η = (0.098 N * 0.0003 m) / (0.085 m/s * 0.10 m^2) = (0.0000294) / (0.0085) ≈ 0.0034588 kg/(m·s).

    "explanation": "Using Stokes' law, we have 6πηaυ = (4π/3)a^3(ρ - σ)g. Solving for η: η = [ (4a^2 (ρ - σ)g ) / (9υ) ]. Given: a = 2.0 mm = 0.002 m, υ = 6.5 cm/s = 0.065 m/s, ρ = 8.9×10^3 kg/m^3, σ = 1.5×10^3 kg/m^3, and g = 9.8 m/s^2. Difference in densities: 8.9×10^3 - 1.5×10^3 = 7.4×10^3 kg/m^3. Plug into the formula: η = [4*(0.002)^2*(7.4×10^3)*9.8] / [9*0.065]. Calculate numerator: (0.002)^2 = 4×10^-6; then 4*4×10^-6 = 16×10^-6; multiplied by 7.4×10^3 gives 16×10^-6*7.4×10^3 = 0.1184; multiplied by 9.8 gives approximately 1.161. Denom: 9*0.065 = 0.585. So, η ≈ 1.161 / 0.585 ≈ 1.985 kg/(m·s). The example in the text gives approximately 0.99 kg/(m·s) because of rounding and factor differences. Rechecking the constant factor: Actually, the standard derivation gives η = (2/9)*(a^2 (ρ - σ)g)/υ. Using that: η = (2/9)*((0.002)^2*7.4×10^3*9.8)/0.065. Now, (0.002)^2 = 4×10^-6; multiplied by 7.4×10^3 gives 0.0296; multiplied by 9.8 gives 0.29008; then (2/9)*0.29008 = 0.06446; finally, 0.06446/0.065 ≈ 0.991.
