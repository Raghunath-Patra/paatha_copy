    "correct_answer": "A particle in SHM oscillates about an equilibrium position with displacement described by x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ). The velocity is given by v(t) = -A ω sin(ωt + φ) and is maximum when x = 0, while the acceleration is a(t) = -A ω² cos(ωt + φ), which is greatest at the endpoints. These relations show that displacement, velocity, and acceleration are sinusoidally related with phase differences of π/2 between velocity and displacement, and π between acceleration and displacement.",
    "explanation": "The displacement follows a cosine function, while the velocity, obtained by differentiating displacement, is a sine function shifted by -π/2. The acceleration, being the derivative of velocity or the second derivative of displacement, is proportional to the negative of displacement, confirming Hooke's law.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Starting with the position function x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ), note that the cosine function is periodic with a period of 2π. This means that x(t) = x(t + T) if ωT = 2π, which gives the relation ω = 2π / T. The period T is important because it represents the time taken for one complete cycle of oscillation, indicating how quickly the motion repeats.",
    "explanation": "By setting the argument of the cosine function to repeat after an interval T (i.e. ω(t + T) = ωt + 2π), dividing both sides by ω yields T = 2π/ω. The period T is a key parameter because it describes the temporal repetition of the oscillatory motion, and it is linked to the frequency of oscillation (f = 1/T).

    "correct_answer": "While the two motions share the same frequency and phase, the oscillator with the larger amplitude has a higher maximum displacement and, therefore, greater kinetic and potential energy. Since the energy stored in an oscillator is proportional to the square of the amplitude (E ∝ A²), the oscillator with twice the amplitude has four times the energy.",
    "explanation": "The amplitude determines the maximum extent of displacement from equilibrium. In SHM, both kinetic energy (when the object passes through the equilibrium) and potential energy (at the extremes) depend on the amplitude. Specifically, for a spring-mass system, the total mechanical energy is given by (1/2)kA². Hence, increasing the amplitude increases the stored energy quadratically.
