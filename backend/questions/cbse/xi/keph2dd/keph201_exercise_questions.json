    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 1.79",
    "explanation": "Using the formula for elongation ΔL = (F L)/(A Y) and equating the elongation for both wires gives L₍steel₎/(A₍steel₎ Y₍steel₎) = L₍copper₎/(A₍copper₎ Y₍copper₎). Rearranging yields Y₍steel₎/Y₍copper₎ = (L₍steel₎ × A₍copper₎)/(L₍copper₎ × A₍steel₎). Substituting the numerical values: (4.7 m × 4.0×10⁻⁵ m²)/(3.5 m × 3.0×10⁻⁵ m²) ≈ (1.88×10⁻⁴)/(1.05×10⁻⁴) ≈ 1.79.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Young's modulus is obtained from the slope of the initial linear (elastic) portion of the curve; (b) the yield strength is the stress at the point where the curve starts to deviate from linearity.",
    "explanation": "In a stress–strain curve, the initial linear region represents elastic behavior where stress is directly proportional to strain (Hooke's law). The slope of this portion is the Young's modulus. The yield strength is identified at the end of this linear region where the material begins to yield (enter plastic deformation), typically seen as a deviation or plateau in the graph.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) The material with the steeper initial linear slope has the greater Young's modulus. (b) The stronger material is the one that can sustain the higher ultimate stress before failure.",
    "explanation": "Young's modulus is determined by the slope of the elastic (initial) portion of the stress–strain curve. The material whose curve rises more steeply in this region is stiffer (has a higher Young’s modulus). The strength of a material is usually gauged by its ultimate tensile strength (the maximum stress reached). Whichever graph reaches a higher stress before failure indicates a stronger material.",

    "explanation": "Rubber is much less stiff than steel and therefore has a much lower Young's modulus.

    "explanation": "The elongation for a wire under tension is given by ΔL = (F L)/(A Y). For the steel wire, the tension supports both masses (4.0 kg + 6.0 kg giving about 98 N) and for the brass wire the tension is from 6.0 kg (about 59 N). Using the cross-sectional area A = π(d/2)² with d = 0.25 cm = 0.0025 m, and substituting the respective lengths and assumed Young's modulus values, one can calculate the elongation.

The shear strain is given by (shear stress)/(shear modulus) = 98,000 / (25×10⁹) ≈ 3.92×10⁻⁶.

Since elongation ΔL = (F L)/(A Y) and the tension F and length L are the same for each wire, the cross-sectional area A must be proportional to 1/Y. With typical Young's modulus values of about 1.1×10¹¹ N/m² for copper and 2.0×10¹¹ N/m² for iron, the ratio of areas required is A_copper/A_iron = Y_iron/Y_copper ≈ 2.0×10¹¹ / 1.1×10¹¹ ≈ 1.82.
