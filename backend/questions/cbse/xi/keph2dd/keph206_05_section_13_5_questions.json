The sinusoidal variations in these equations directly correspond to the circular motion, where the periodicity and phase differences illustrate the oscillatory nature of SHM.",
    "explanation": "When a point P moves in a circle with constant angular speed, its x-coordinate is given by A cos(ωt + φ). This projection is sinusoidal. The geometric relationship implies that the velocity (the time derivative of displacement) is also sinusoidal, but with a phase shift of π/2, and the acceleration, being the derivative of velocity, has a phase shift of π relative to the displacement.
