In contrast, the Clausius statement prohibits a process that solely results in the transfer of heat from a colder body to a hotter one without any work input. These two statements are interconnected because they both are expressions of the inherent irreversibility of natural processes and the impossibility of eliminating losses in energy transformations. Their equivalence can be demonstrated by showing that the violation of one inevitably leads to the violation of the other.",

This process would entail the complete conversion of heat from the ice into work, which violates the Kelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law. In reality, such a process is not observed because natural energy conversions always involve some degree of inefficiency and irreversible heat losses due to the spontaneous tendency for entropy to increase.",
