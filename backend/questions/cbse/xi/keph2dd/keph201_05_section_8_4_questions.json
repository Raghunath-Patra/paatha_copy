    "correct_answer": "A stress-strain curve is analyzed by identifying specific regions and points. Young's modulus is determined from the slope of the initial linear (elastic) region (from O to A) where stress and strain are proportional. The yield strength is identified at the yield point (point B), where the material transitions from elastic to plastic behavior. Finally, the ultimate tensile strength is the maximum stress value reached on the curve before necking and fracture occur.",
    "explanation": "To determine these properties, first plot the measured stress versus strain values. In the elastic region, fit a straight line; its slope gives Young's modulus. Identify the point where the curve deviates from linearity; this is the yield point, and its stress value is the yield strength. Continue increasing the load until the stress reaches a maximum value, which represents the ultimate tensile strength.

    "correct_answer": "Metals typically exhibit a distinct linear elastic region followed by a plastic deformation range and finally fracture, characterized by a well-defined yield point and ultimate tensile strength. Elastomers, on the other hand, have a very large elastic region with a non-linear stress-strain relationship and lack a clear plastic region. These differences mean that metals are suitable for load-bearing applications requiring strength and rigidity, while elastomers are used in applications needing large deformations and flexibility, such as damping and sealing.",
    "explanation": "The distinct mechanical properties indicated by the stress-strain curves allow engineers to select materials based on performance requirements. Metals are chosen when high strength and resistance to deformation are required.
