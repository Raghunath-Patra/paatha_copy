In the case of a gas in a piston, heat added to the gas increases internal energy by raising the random kinetic energies of the molecules, whereas work done on the gas (by compressing it) increases the internal energy by reducing the volume and increasing molecular collisions. Both processes result in a change in the gas’s thermodynamic state.",

Even though the amounts of heat and work transfer vary with different paths between the same initial and final states, the total change in internal energy, computed as the sum of heat supplied and work done (delta U = Q + W), remains constant for that state change.

    "correct_answer": "One experimental approach is to use a gas in a cylinder with a movable piston and equip the setup with precise thermometers and force sensors. First, isolate a process where only heat is exchanged by keeping the piston fixed (constant volume) to measure the change in internal energy solely due to heat. Then, perform another experiment where the system undergoes an adiabatic process (no heat exchange) and work is done by the piston. By comparing the change in internal energy in both cases and applying the First Law of Thermodynamics, one can quantify the contributions of heat and work separately.",
