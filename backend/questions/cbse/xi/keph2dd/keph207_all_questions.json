(a) At constant temperature, changes in pressure are accompanied by proportional changes in density so that the ratio remains invariant.

The separation between successive nodes is half the wavelength. This interference pattern remains stationary, even though individual points on the string oscillate.",

    "correct_answer": "The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves travel through the same medium, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of their individual displacements. In the case of a string fixed at both ends, an incident wave and its reflected wave (traveling in opposite directions) combine. Their constructive and destructive interference at different points leads to fixed points of zero displacement (nodes) and points of maximum displacement (antinodes), forming a standing wave.",

This duality distinguishes the traveling wave's spatial form from the temporal oscillation of individual medium elements.",
    "explanation": "The phase (kx - ωt + φ) determines that for an increase in time, to keep the phase constant (such as at a crest), the position x must also increase, indicating wave propagation.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Standing waves in a column occur when two waves of equal frequency and amplitude traveling in opposite directions superimpose, resulting in fixed points of zero displacement called nodes and points of maximum oscillation called antinodes. The nodes occur because of destructive interference, while the antinodes occur due to constructive interference.",
    "explanation": "When a wave traveling down a medium reflects from a boundary, such as a fixed end, it interferes with the incoming wave. The superposition of these waves, when they have the same frequency and amplitude, produces a standing wave pattern. Nodes remain stationary because the interfering waves cancel each other out at those points, while at antinodes the wave amplitudes add up. This phenomenon is crucial in understanding resonance in instruments and pipes.",

    "explanation": "In progressive wave motion, energy is transferred through the medium by oscillations of its particles. Although the disturbances (e.g., pulses on a string or sound waves) move from one location to another, the individual particles oscillate around their fixed equilibrium positions.

    "correct_answer": "Approximately 2.83",
    "explanation": "For two waves with amplitude a = 2 and phase difference φ = π/2, the resultant amplitude is given by 2a cos(φ/2). Here, φ/2 = π/4 and cos(π/4) is approximately 0.7071. Thus, amplitude = 2 x 2 x 0.7071 = 2.8284, which is about 2.83.",

    "question_text": "A stretched string supports two in-phase harmonic waves, both described by y1 = a sin(kx - ωt) with a = 2 cm, and y2 = a sin(kx - ωt). When they are superimposed, what is the amplitude and equation of the resultant wave?",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Amplitude is 4 cm and the resultant wave is y = 4 sin(kx - ωt).",
    "explanation": "Since both waves are in phase (φ = 0), the superposition gives y = 2a sin(kx - ωt) with a = 2 cm. Thus, the amplitude is 2 x 2 = 4 cm and the equation of the resultant wave is y = 4 sin(kx - ωt).",
