    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When one spring in a series is displaced from equilibrium, it exerts a force on its neighboring spring due to the elastic linking between them, initiating a small oscillation. This oscillation then propagates along the chain, similar to how compression and rarefaction propagate in air when a sound wave is generated. In air, when a region is compressed, the increased density creates a restoring force that pushes the particles outward, leading to adjacent regions experiencing expansion (rarefaction). This continuous process results in the movement of a pressure wave that carries energy without the net movement of air.",
    "explanation": "The process relies on the elasticity of the medium. In both systems, energy is transmitted via local interactionsâ€”spring forces in the case of a coupled spring system, and pressure forces in the case of air. This example illustrates the similar underlying physics of harmonic motion and wave propagation in different media.",

    "correct_answer": "Mechanical waves require a medium for propagation, such as air for sound or water for ocean waves. Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum; they are essential for communication technologies, including radios, microwaves, and optical fibers. Matter waves, which arise from quantum mechanics, describe the wave-like behavior of particles such as electrons and are crucial in technologies like electron microscopes. While mechanical and electromagnetic waves follow classical laws of oscillations and energy transfer, matter waves involve probability amplitudes and are described by quantum theory.",
    "explanation": "This comparison highlights the differences in propagation mechanisms: mechanical waves depend on material interactions, electromagnetic waves are independent of a medium, and matter waves represent a dual particle-wave nature inherent in quantum systems. Their applications are equally diverse, reflecting the breadth of wave phenomena in both classical and modern physics.",
