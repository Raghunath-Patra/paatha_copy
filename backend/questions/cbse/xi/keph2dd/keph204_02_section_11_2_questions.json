    "correct_answer": "Experiments with gas systems using adiabatic and diathermic walls illustrate that the type of wall determines whether energy exchange occurs between the systems. With an adiabatic wall, no heat transfer takes place, and each system can be in any state with respect to its pressure and volume without affecting the other, even if their temperatures differ. When the adiabatic wall is replaced by a diathermic wall, heat can flow between the systems. Consequently, their macroscopic variables—including temperature, pressure, and volume—change until both systems reach the same temperature, at which point thermal equilibrium is achieved.",

    "correct_answer": "The Zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law is significant because it provides the fundamental basis for the concept of temperature as a measurable and comparable quantity. It implies that temperature is the property that determines the direction of heat flow: if there is no net heat flow, the systems must have the same temperature. Thus, the Zeroth law establishes the criteria for thermal equilibrium by ensuring that systems in contact eventually achieve a uniform temperature.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a closed thermodynamic system, the macroscopic state variables—pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy, and entropy—interact to define the state of the system. Equilibrium is achieved when these variables become constant, meaning that there is no net change in energy or disorder within the system. Internal energy is a function of temperature and molecular motion, while entropy measures the degree of disorder or randomness. During any spontaneous process, the system tends to move towards a state with increased entropy, and when energy exchanges (such as heat transfer) occur until no further change is possible, the system has reached equilibrium. This shows how the interplay between energy and disorder ultimately governs the balance of the system.",

Equate U_total = 3*R*T_final, so T_final = U_total / (3*R) = 81.18 / (3*0.082) = 81.18 / 0.246 = approximately 330 K. Note: A slight discrepancy with the provided correct answer indicates rounding differences; however, using energy conservation the final equilibrium temperature should be around 330 K.
