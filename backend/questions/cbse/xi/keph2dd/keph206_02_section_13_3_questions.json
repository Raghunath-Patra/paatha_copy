    "correct_answer": "Phase differences shift the entire motion along the time axis. For two SHM functions differing by a phase of π/4, one motion leads the other by π/4 radians. This means that at any given time, the positions and velocities of the two motions are out of sync by the time equivalent of π/4 radians. For example, if one function is x1(t)= A cos(ωt) and the other is x2(t)= A cos(ωt - π/4), then at t = 0, x1(0)= A while x2(0)= A cos(-π/4)= A/√2, showing a difference in initial displacement. Similarly, their velocities will be different since velocity is given by the derivative of the displacement.",
    "explanation": "Phase difference in SHM implies a horizontal shift in the cosine wave. This results in differences in the time at which peaks, zeros, and troughs occur, thereby affecting both the instantaneous displacement and velocity. By comparing x1(t)= A cos(ωt) and x2(t)= A cos(ωt - π/4), we see that the second oscillator reaches equivalent points in its cycle π/4 radians earlier than the first.",
