The height of the mercury column is proportional to the atmospheric pressure, and a typical height of 76 cm corresponds to about 1 atmosphere.

    "correct_answer": "Hydraulic lifts operate on Pascal’s law, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted uniformly throughout the fluid. When an input force F1 is applied on a piston with area A1, it creates a pressure P equal to F1/A1. This same pressure is transmitted to a larger piston with area A2, which then exerts an output force F2 = P × A2 = (F1/A1) × A2. Thus, the force is amplified by a factor of A2/A1. This system enables heavy loads to be lifted with relatively little input force, making it both efficient and effective in applications such as car lifts and hydraulic brakes.",
    "explanation": "The derivation uses the principle of equal pressure throughout a fluid. The mechanical advantage of the hydraulic lift is provided by the ratio of the piston areas, allowing small forces to generate significant lifting forces.
