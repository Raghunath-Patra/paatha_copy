    "correct_answer": "Materials deform under an applied force because the external load overcomes the internal forces holding the atoms or molecules in place. Elastic deformation occurs when the material changes shape temporarily and then returns to its original form after the force is removed. Plastic deformation, on the other hand, occurs when the material is permanently altered even after the force is removed.",
    "explanation": "Under the influence of force, the distance between particles in a material changes. In the elastic regime, these changes are within the material's ability to recover, while in the plastic regime, the internal structure is permanently altered.

In automotive design, materials with suitable elasticity can absorb impacts without permanent deformation, enhancing safety.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Even though materials like steel are considered rigid due to their ability to maintain a definite shape and size, they are not perfectly rigid. When forces exceed a certain threshold, known as the elastic limit, these materials undergo deformation. Initially, the deformation is elastic, meaning the material recovers its original shape when the force is removed. However, beyond the elastic limit, permanent or plastic deformation can occur due to the rearrangement of the atomic structure.",
    "explanation": "This behavior is explained by the fact that no material is perfectly rigid; internal atomic bonds can only sustain limited displacement before they reconfigure.
