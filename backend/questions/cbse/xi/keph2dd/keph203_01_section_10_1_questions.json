The Celsius scale is widely used in everyday contexts, whereas the Kelvin scale, which starts at absolute zero, is crucial in scientific laws such as the ideal gas law because it provides an absolute measure of thermal energy. In the ideal gas law, temperature in Kelvin ensures that the proportionality between pressure, volume, and temperature is maintained without ambiguities that zero points other than absolute zero would introduce.",
    "explanation": "Temperature plays a key role in determining the behavior of gases, liquids, and solids. The Kelvin scale is necessary for equations like PV = nRT because it correlates directly to molecular energy.
