Radiation is the transfer of energy through electromagnetic waves and does not require a medium, for example, the heat from the Sun.",
    "explanation": "In conduction, heat is transmitted by collisions among particles in a solid. In convection, heated fluid expands and rises, while cooler fluid sinks, creating circulation currents. In radiation, energy is emitted as electromagnetic waves, which can travel through a vacuum.

    "explanation": "A reflective metallic coating minimizes the radiation emitted from the body and also reflects external radiation.

Factors to control include minimizing heat loss through radiation and convection, ensuring a steady state is reached, and accurately measuring the temperature gradient across the rod.",
    "explanation": "The procedure requires that the rod's ends be in good thermal contact with the reservoirs and that lateral losses be minimized by insulation. Ensuring that a steady state is achieved guarantees constant heat flow.
