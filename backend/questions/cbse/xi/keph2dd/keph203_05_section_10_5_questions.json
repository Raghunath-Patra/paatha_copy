For a fixed rod, as the temperature changes, the rod generates stresses because it cannot freely expand or contract, leading to potential structural issues such as buckling or fracture.",

    "correct_answer": "Heating the metallic lid causes it to expand due to an increase in the kinetic energy of its atoms. This expansion increases the lid's diameter slightly, reducing the tightness of the seal. When immersed in hot water, the lid expands and creates a slight gap between the threads, making it easier to unscrew.",
    "explanation": "The phenomenon of thermal expansion causes materials to increase in dimension when heated, according to the relation Δl / l = α₁ ΔT. In the case of a metallic lid, even a small increase in diameter can overcome the frictional forces holding it tight on the bottle.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Water exhibits anomalous thermal expansion by contracting from 0°C to 4°C, reaching maximum density at 4°C before expanding with further temperature increase. This property means that as a lake cools, water near the surface becomes denser and sinks until the surface water drops below 4°C, where it becomes less dense and remains at the top, eventually freezing. This freezing from the top protects aquatic life by insulating the water below.",
    "explanation": "The unique expansion behavior of water ensures that ice forms at the surface rather than the bottom, preserving a liquid environment underneath during winter. The maximum density at 4°C results from the hydrogen bonding in water, leading to this anomaly. Environmental implications include the survival of aquatic species through the winter months, as the insulating ice layer prevents complete solidification of the water body.",

    "correct_answer": "For an ideal gas, the coefficient of volume expansion is given by α_v = 1/T, indicating an inverse relationship with temperature. As temperature increases, the magnitude of α_v decreases. This behavior differs significantly from solids and liquids, whose α_v values are relatively constant over moderate temperature ranges because their intermolecular forces are much stronger and less sensitive to temperature changes.",
    "explanation": "The ideal gas law (PV = μRT) implies that at constant pressure, the fractional volume change is proportional to ΔT/T, leading to α_v = 1/T. In gases, the particles are far apart and interact weakly, making their expansion highly sensitive to temperature. Conversely, the molecules in solids and liquids are closely packed with strong intermolecular forces, resulting in a much smaller and relatively constant thermal expansion coefficient.",
