This color change marks the end point of the titration.",
    "explanation": "For example, potassium permanganate (KMnO4) acts as a self indicator; its deep purple color persists when excess is present, thus indicating the end point.

    "explanation": "Step 1: Write the skeletal ionic equation without spectator ions. Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers to identify that Cr in Cr2O7^2- is reduced from +6 to +3 and S in SO3^2- is oxidized from +4 to +6. Step 3: Balance the number of atoms undergoing changes by multiplying the species so that the total increase and decrease in oxidation numbers balance (2 Cr atoms and 3 S atoms in this case). Step 4: Since the reaction is in acidic medium, add H^+ ions to balance the charge; here, 8 H^+ are added. Step 5: Balance the oxygen atoms by adding water molecules; 4 H2O molecules are added to the product side. The resultant balanced net ionic equation is: Cr2O7^2- (aq) + 3 SO3^2- (aq) + 8 H^+ (aq) → 2 Cr^3+ (aq) + 3 SO4^2- (aq) + 4 H2O (l).",

    "correct_answer": "The oxidation number method simplifies the process by focusing on the changes in oxidation numbers and balancing electron transfer directly; however, it may become cumbersome if multiple elements change states. The half reaction method splits the overall reaction into oxidation and reduction parts that are balanced separately and then combined. This method is systematic and easier to verify for both mass and charge balance, especially in aqueous solutions, but requires additional steps such as balancing H2O, H+, or OH- depending on the medium.",
    "explanation": "The oxidation number method involves assigning oxidation states, calculating the increase/decrease in oxidation numbers, and then balancing these changes. Its advantage lies in its simplicity for straightforward reactions. The half reaction method, on the other hand, isolates the oxidation and reduction processes, balancing each for atoms and charge before combining them. This makes it particularly useful for reactions in acidic or basic solutions where balancing of H2O and H+/OH- is required. Both methods ultimately ensure that the number of electrons lost equals those gained, but the choice depends on the complexity of the reaction and the analyst's comfort with the method.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the reaction with HCl, Pb3O4 undergoes both an acid-base and a redox reaction because Pb3O4 contains PbO2 (where Pb is +4) and PbO (where Pb is +2). PbO2 acts as an oxidising agent, oxidising Cl– to Cl2, while PbO reacts to form PbCl2. In contrast, HNO3 is itself an oxidising agent, so the PbO2 portion does not further react redox-wise, resulting in a reaction that is predominantly acid-base with PbO reacting with HNO3 to form Pb(NO3)2 and leaving PbO2 largely unreacted. This difference in behavior highlights how the inherent oxidising or reducing nature of the acid can influence the reaction pathway.",
    "explanation": "Pb3O4 is considered a composite of PbO and PbO2. When reacting with HCl, the PbO2 portion oxidizes Cl– to Cl2 while the PbO portion undergoes an acid-base reaction to form PbCl2. With HNO3, since HNO3 is already a strong oxidising agent, it does not promote further oxidation of Cl–, and the redox reaction is suppressed in favor of acid-base reactions. This analysis shows that the oxidation states within Pb3O4 are critical in determining the reaction mechanism based on the nature of the acid used.",
