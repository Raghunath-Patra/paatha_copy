    "explanation": "The ability of a compound to act as an oxidant or reductant depends on the possibility of further oxidation or reduction.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the reducing agent is in excess, there are more electrons available, pushing the oxidising species to a lower oxidation state. Conversely, when the oxidising agent is in excess, it withdraws more electrons from the reducing species, resulting in a higher oxidation state. Examples include: (1) The reaction of Fe3+ with excess Fe2+ produces Fe2+ (with insufficient oxidising power to convert all Fe2+ to Fe3+), (2) the oxidation of iodide with limited oxidant yields I– rather than higher oxidation state iodine compounds, and (3) in the oxidation of alcohols, excess oxidant can lead to the formation of carboxylic acids compared to aldehydes when the oxidant is limited.",
    "explanation": "The final oxidation state of a species in a redox reaction depends on the relative amounts of electrons donated and accepted. An excess of reducing agent provides enough electrons to force the oxidant into a reduced, lower oxidation state, while an excess of oxidant withdraws more electrons, oxidising the species to a higher state.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

(b) Chloride ions are oxidised by sulphuric acid under these conditions to form gaseous HCl, while bromide ions are more easily oxidised to elemental bromine, which is volatile and exhibits a red colour.",
    "explanation": "The reaction environment influences the outcome of redox processes. In the case of toluene oxidation, an alcoholic medium with KMnO4 restricts over-oxidation and facilitates the formation of benzoic acid.

    "correct_answer": "Thiosulphate reacts differently because the oxidising power of iodine is lower than that of bromine. Consequently, with iodine, thiosulphate is only partly oxidized to tetrathionate, while with the stronger oxidant bromine, it is oxidized further to sulphate.",
    "explanation": "The different outcomes arise from the relative oxidising strengths of I2 and Br2.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A commonly accepted balanced equation is: 2Mn3+(aq) + H2O(l) → Mn2+(aq) + MnO2(s) + 2H+(aq).",
    "explanation": "In this disproportionation reaction, one Mn3+ ion is reduced to Mn2+ while another is oxidized to MnO2. Balancing the atoms and charges leads to the above equation, which reflects the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of manganese.",

Oxygen is the limiting reagent (needed for 0.735 mol NH3 but available amount corresponds to 0.625 mol O2).
