    "correct_answer": "The evolution began with the belief in a 'vital force' proposed by Berzelius, which suggested that organic compounds could only be produced by living organisms. This theory was challenged and eventually overturned when Wöhler synthesized urea from an inorganic compound, ammonium cyanate. Later, the pioneering synthesis of acetic acid by Kolbe and methane by Berthelot further established that organic compounds could be synthesized in the laboratory from inorganic sources. The development of the electronic theory of covalent bonding also played a key role in shaping modern organic chemistry.",
    "explanation": "The answer should address the historical progression from the vital force theory to the synthesis of organic compounds from inorganic materials, citing Wöhler's experiment and subsequent studies by Kolbe and Berthelot.

Kolbe's synthesis of acetic acid in 1845 and Berthelot's synthesis of methane in 1856 were pivotal experiments that underscored the chemical nature of organic compounds. While Kolbe's work focused on synthesizing a carboxylic acid, Berthelot's work involved producing a simple hydrocarbon. Comparing their approaches reveals differences in target molecules and reaction conditions, but both set the stage for proving that organic molecules did not necessarily require a 'vital force' for their formation.",

This theory allowed chemists to predict molecular structures, reaction mechanisms, and the properties of organic compounds. For example, the understanding of electron distribution in molecules has led to the design of more efficient synthesis routes and the development of novel materials such as polymers. It also underpins the rational design of pharmaceuticals by predicting reactivity and interactions at the molecular level.",
