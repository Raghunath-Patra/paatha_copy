In contrast, stereoisomerism involves compounds with the same connectivity but a different spatial arrangement of atoms or groups; examples include geometrical isomers, such as cis-trans isomers, and optical isomers, such as enantiomers.",
    "explanation": "Structural isomers differ in the actual bonding arrangement (which atoms are connected to which), resulting in distinct chemical and physical properties. Stereoisomers, however, have the same bonded structure but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement, affecting how they interact with other molecules, such as enzymes or receptors.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The three isomers of C₅H₁₂ exhibit different carbon skeletons: pentane has a straight chain, isopentane has a single branch, and neopentane has a highly branched structure. The differences in structure affect molecular surface area and the strength of the London dispersion forces. Generally, a straight chain (pentane) has a larger surface area, resulting in stronger intermolecular attractions and a higher boiling point, while increased branching (as in neopentane) reduces surface area, thereby lowering the boiling point.",
    "explanation": "Molecular shape plays a crucial role in determining physical properties. In alkanes, more branching leads to weaker intermolecular forces due to a decrease in contact surface between molecules. Hence, pentane has the highest boiling point among the isomers, followed by isopentane and then neopentane.",

    "correct_answer": "Stereoisomerism refers to isomers having the same structural connectivity but differing in the spatial arrangement of atoms. Geometrical isomerism arises due to restricted rotation, as seen in cis-trans isomers in compounds with double bonds or rings. An example is cis- and trans-2-butene. Optical isomerism, on the other hand, occurs when molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other due to the presence of a chiral center, such as in lactic acid.",
    "explanation": "The key aspect of stereoisomerism is the three-dimensional orientation of groups. Geometrical isomers differ because of the fixed position around a double bond or ring system, whereas optical isomers (enantiomers) differ in the way they rotate plane-polarized light and interact with chiral environments.",
