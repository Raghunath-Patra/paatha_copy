    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mechanism of methane halogenation begins with the initiation step, where Cl2 undergoes homolytic cleavage under light or heat to form two chlorine radicals. During the propagation steps, a chlorine radical abstracts a hydrogen from methane to form HCl and a methyl radical. The methyl radical then reacts with another Cl2 molecule to produce chloromethane and regenerate a chlorine radical, which continues the chain. Termination occurs when radicals recombine to form stable molecules such as Cl2 or CH3–CH3, thereby ending the chain reaction. This process is termed a chain reaction because the formation of one radical leads to a propagation cycle that generates more radicals, continuously sustaining the reaction until termination steps dominate.",
    "explanation": "The answer details each step of the free radical chain mechanism in the halogenation reaction and explains how the propagation steps regenerate radicals, resulting in a self-sustaining reaction until the radical concentration diminishes.",

    "correct_answer": "In ethane, the eclipsed conformation has the hydrogen atoms on one carbon directly aligned with the hydrogen atoms on the other carbon, leading to maximum torsional strain due to electron cloud repulsion. In the staggered conformation, the hydrogens are arranged at maximum angles from one another (dihedral angles of approximately 60°), minimizing repulsion and torsional strain. Sawhorse projections show the relative positions of groups in three dimensions, while Newman projections view the molecule along the C–C bond axis, clearly showing the eclipsed (overlap) and staggered (offset) arrangements.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains the spatial differences and energetic consequences of the two conformations. The staggered form is more stable due to minimized torsional strain, a concept clearly illustrated in both Sawhorse and Newman projection methods.",
