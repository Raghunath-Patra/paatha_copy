An advantage of the framework model is clarity in bond connectivity, while a limitation is the absence of atomic size information. The ball-and-stick model gives a balanced view of both bonds and atoms but may distort spatial perception, and the space-filling model accurately represents size but is less clear for bond angles.",
    "explanation": "Each model highlights different aspects: the framework model is good for outlining connectivity, the ball-and-stick model for both connectivity and atom positions, and the space-filling model for understanding how atoms occupy space.

    "correct_answer": "To convert a bond-line formula of cyclohexane to a complete structural formula, start by recognizing that each vertex represents a carbon atom. Replace each vertex with a carbon atom, then add hydrogen atoms to satisfy the tetravalency of carbon (each carbon must have four bonds). Bonds that are drawn as lines represent carbon-carbon bonds; add the necessary hydrogen atoms in such a way that each carbon has four bonds in total. For instance, if a carbon in the ring has two bonds to adjacent carbons, it must have two hydrogen atoms attached. Draw all hydrogen atoms explicitly.",

Additionally, considering hydrogen bonds implicit on each carbon after satisfying tetravalency (CH3 has 3, CHBr has 2, CH2 has 2, and CH3 has 3), the total number of bonds including carbon-hydrogen is 3+2+2+3 = 10 C–H bonds.
