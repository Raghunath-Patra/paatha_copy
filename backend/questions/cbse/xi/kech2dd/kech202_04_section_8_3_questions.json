An advantage of the framework model is clarity in bond connectivity, while a limitation is the absence of atomic size information. The ball-and-stick model gives a balanced view of both bonds and atoms but may distort spatial perception, and the space-filling model accurately represents size but is less clear for bond angles.",
    "explanation": "Each model highlights different aspects: the framework model is good for outlining connectivity, the ball-and-stick model for both connectivity and atom positions, and the space-filling model for understanding how atoms occupy space.

    "correct_answer": "To convert a bond-line formula of cyclohexane to a complete structural formula, start by recognizing that each vertex represents a carbon atom. Replace each vertex with a carbon atom, then add hydrogen atoms to satisfy the tetravalency of carbon (each carbon must have four bonds). Bonds that are drawn as lines represent carbon-carbon bonds; add the necessary hydrogen atoms in such a way that each carbon has four bonds in total. For instance, if a carbon in the ring has two bonds to adjacent carbons, it must have two hydrogen atoms attached. Draw all hydrogen atoms explicitly.",
