    "correct_answer": "A galvanic cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy through spontaneous redox reactions. It has two half-cells, each containing a metal electrode immersed in a solution of its salts. The oxidation occurs at the anode (e.g., zinc electrode) where electrons are released, while reduction occurs at the cathode (e.g., copper electrode) where electrons are consumed. The potential difference between the electrodes, known as the cell potential, is established because the two electrodes have different tendencies to lose or gain electrons, as indicated by their standard electrode potentials. A salt bridge is used to permit ion flow, which maintains the charge balance in the half-cells and allows the cell to continuously produce electrical energy.",
    "explanation": "The galvanic cell operates based on the difference in electrode potentials between the two half-cells. The oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode create an electron flow through an external circuit.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An experimental setup for demonstrating indirect electron transfer would involve two separate beakers, one containing copper sulfate solution with a copper electrode and the other containing zinc sulfate solution with a zinc electrode. A salt bridge filled with an inert electrolyte, such as potassium chloride solidified with agar agar, connects the two solutions. A metallic wire, equipped with a switch and ammeter, connects the two electrodes. In this setup, oxidation occurs at the zinc electrode (anode) and reduction at the copper electrode (cathode). The salt bridge ensures that ionic charge is balanced between the half-cells as electrons travel through the external circuit. This arrangement offers advantages over direct electron transfer in that it isolates the oxidation and reduction processes, minimizes unwanted side reactions, and allows for better control and analysis of individual half-reactions.",
    "explanation": "The described setup separates the redox processes, which allows the study of each half-cell independently. The use of a salt bridge maintains electrical neutrality and prevents mixing of the reactants.
