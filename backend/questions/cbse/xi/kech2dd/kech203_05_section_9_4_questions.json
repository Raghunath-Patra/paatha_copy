    "correct_answer": "The hydrogen atoms in ethyne are more acidic because they are attached to sp hybridized carbons, which have 50% s-character and hence are more electronegative. This increased electronegativity pulls electron density towards the carbon, stabilizing the negative charge when the hydrogen is removed as a proton.",
    "explanation": "In ethyne, the carbons are sp hybridized (50% s-character), causing the C–H bonds to be more polar and the hydrogen more easily removed as a proton.

    "explanation": "Each carbon in C2H2 uses two sp hybrid orbitals to form the carbon-carbon σ bond and two C–H σ bonds. The remaining two p orbitals on each carbon overlap sideways to form two π bonds. This arrangement produces a linear molecule with bond angles of 180°.",

    "correct_answer": "Cyclic polymerization of ethyne involves the trimerization of three ethyne molecules under high temperature conditions (in a red-hot iron tube at 873 K) to form benzene. The reaction involves the rearrangement of triple bonds to form alternating single and double bonds making up the aromatic benzene ring. This method is significant because it represents a direct conversion from an aliphatic alkyne to an aromatic compound, thereby facilitating the synthesis of a vast number of benzene derivatives used in dyes, drugs, and other organic compounds.",
    "explanation": "The process, commonly known as cyclotrimerization, allows three molecules of C2H2 to react and rearrange their bonds to form C6H6. This reaction helps in bridging the gap between aliphatic and aromatic chemistry. The rearrangement driven by high temperature and the iron catalyst ensures the stabilization of the aromatic system in benzene.",

    "correct_answer": "The C≡C triple bond in ethyne has a bond enthalpy of approximately 823 kJ/mol and a bond length of 120 pm, which is stronger and shorter than the C=C double bond (681 kJ/mol; 133 pm) and the single C–C bond (348 kJ/mol; 154 pm). The differences arise because the triple bond has one σ bond (formed by head-on overlap of sp orbitals) and two π bonds (formed by lateral overlap of unhybridized 2p orbitals), resulting in greater orbital overlap and electron density between the carbon atoms. This increased overlap shortens the bond length and increases the bond strength compared to double and single bonds.",
    "explanation": "The sigma bond formed by the sp-sp overlap is very strong due to 50% s-character and the two additional pi bonds add further stability. In contrast, C=C bonds, with sp2 hybridization, have less s-character and longer bond distances, while C–C bonds, formed with sp3 orbitals, have even less overlap and longer bond lengths.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The synthesis starts with ethanoic acid (CH3COOH), which is converted into sodium acetate (CH3COONa) by reaction with NaOH. Upon heating with soda lime, sodium acetate undergoes decarboxylation to form methane (CH4). Methane is then chlorinated to form chloromethane (CH3Cl). Using the Wurtz reaction with sodium in dry ether, chloromethane is dimerized to produce ethane (C2H6), which is subsequently dehydrohalogenated using alcoholic KOH to form ethene (CH2=CH2). The ethene is then halogenated by reaction with bromine to form 1,2-dibromoethane (CH2BrCH2Br), which, upon treatment with alcoholic KOH, is converted into vinyl bromide (CH2=CHBr). Finally, vinyl bromide reacts with NaNH2 to form ethyne (C2H2), which on passing through a red-hot iron tube at 873 K undergoes cyclic polymerization (cyclotrimerization) to produce benzene (C6H6).",
    "explanation": "The route involves multiple key transformations: decarboxylation of acetate, chlorination, the Wurtz reaction, dehydrohalogenation, and finally the cyclotrimerization of ethyne into benzene.
