    "explanation": "Reactions (a), (b) and (d) clearly show the addition or removal of oxygen (or other electronegative elements). Reaction (c) involving hydrogen and chlorine forming HCl is a redox process; therefore the answer implies a subtle difference. In classical definitions if one were to consider only oxygen addition or hydrogen removal, reaction (c) might appear ambiguous. However, since all provided options are redox examples by the broadened view, the trick lies in recognizing that H₂ and Cl₂ in their elemental forms combine to form a compound. This process fits redox criteria in the expanded definition; thus, on second thought, all these reactions are redox. In this context, the best answer is that all involve oxidation and reduction simultaneously. Hence, none of the reactions are non-redox.

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the reaction 2 Na (s) + H₂ (g) → 2 NaH (s), electronegativity helps identify the movement of electrons. Sodium (Na) is less electronegative compared to hydrogen, which means sodium has a greater tendency to lose electrons and become oxidized. As a result, sodium donates its electron to hydrogen, forming sodium hydride. Hydrogen, being more electronegative, accepts electrons and is thus reduced. This illustrates that by comparing the electronegativities of the reacting species, we can ascertain the flow of electrons that defines oxidation and reduction.",
    "explanation": "Electronegativity is a key factor in determining redox behavior in reactions. Since sodium is electropositive and hydrogen is more electronegative, the electron transfer from sodium to hydrogen confirms that sodium undergoes oxidation and hydrogen undergoes reduction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Initially, oxidation was defined solely as the addition of oxygen to a substance and reduction as the removal of oxygen. However, observations of reactions where hydrogen was removed (or added) and where other electronegative or electropositive elements were involved led to a broader definition. Examples include the oxidation of methane and the reaction of magnesium with halogens (F₂, Cl₂) or sulphur, illustrating that oxidation can occur through the removal of hydrogen or addition of electronegative elements. Similarly, the reduction reactions involve not only the removal of oxygen but also the addition of hydrogen or electronegative elements, as seen in the reduction of mercuric chloride by tin(II) chloride. This evolution has enabled chemists to classify and understand a wider range of chemical transformations as redox processes.",
    "explanation": "The answer highlights the historical shift from a narrow view of oxidation and reduction to a modern, more inclusive understanding. The examples provided, such as the oxidation of methane and reactions with halogens, underscore this evolution. The enriched definitions now cover a broader spectrum of electron transfer reactions, which is a cornerstone in modern chemistry.",
