    "correct_answer": "Distillation under reduced pressure involves lowering the external pressure on the liquid, which decreases its boiling point. In this apparatus, a round-bottom flask contains the liquid, which is heated while a vacuum pump reduces the pressure. The manometer is used to monitor the pressure inside the system. Reducing pressure allows high boiling liquids or heat-sensitive compounds to be distilled at lower temperatures, thus avoiding decomposition.",
    "explanation": "By evacuating the system with a vacuum pump, the boiling point is lowered according to the relation that a liquid boils when its vapor pressure equals the external pressure.

    "correct_answer": "Column chromatography involves packing a column with an adsorbent, applying the sample on it, and passing an eluant through the column to separate compounds based on differential adsorption. In contrast, TLC uses a thin layer of adsorbent coated on a glass plate. The sample is applied as a spot, and the plate is developed in a solvent. While column chromatography is typically used for preparative separations, TLC is employed for quick analysis and identification of compounds based on their Rf values.",

    "correct_answer": "Sublimation purifies organic compounds by heating an impure solid so that the desired compound sublimes, i.e., converts directly into a vapor, leaving behind non-sublimable impurities. It is advantageous because it is a simple method that can yield pure compound if the impurities do not sublime. However, its limitation is that only compounds that are sublimable can be purified by this method, and it is not applicable to compounds that decompose upon heating or do not sublime easily.",
