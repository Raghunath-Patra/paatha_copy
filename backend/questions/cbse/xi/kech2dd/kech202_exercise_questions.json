    "correct_answer": "For CH₂=C=O (ketene): the terminal CH₂ carbon is sp²‐hybridised and the central carbon (which is double‐bonded to both CH₂ and O) is sp‐hybridised; in CH₃CH=CH₂ (propene): the CH₃ group is sp³, the vinylic CH is sp² and the terminal CH₂ is sp²; in (CH₃)₂CO (acetone): the two CH₃ groups are sp³, and the carbonyl carbon is sp²; in CH₂=CHCN (vinyl cyanide): the CH₂ and the CH of the vinyl group are sp², while the carbon of the -CN group is sp (with the nitrogen also sp); in C₆H₆ (benzene): all carbon atoms are sp²‐hybridised.",
    "explanation": "Each molecule is analysed by recognizing the bonding around each carbon. Carbon atoms forming one double bond (or part of a cumulene system) adjust their hybridisation to achieve appropriate bond angles: sp for linear (as in the central carbon of ketene) and sp² for trigonal planar geometries (as in vinyl groups and benzene). In saturated portions (like methyl groups), carbon is sp³‐hybridised.",

    "correct_answer": "C₆H₆ (benzene): Each of the six C–C bonds is a sigma bond with one delocalized pi system over the ring (six C–H sigma bonds present as well). C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane): Only sigma bonds are present (six C–C and twelve C–H sigma bonds). CH₂Cl₂ (dichloromethane): One carbon forms two C–H sigma bonds and two C–Cl sigma bonds. CH₂=C=CH₂ (allene): The molecule has two C=C double bonds (each comprising 1 sigma and 1 pi bond) plus four C–H sigma bonds. CH₃NO₂ (nitromethane): The CH₃ group contributes three C–H sigma bonds; the C–N bond is a sigma bond, and in the –NO₂ group the resonance structure shows one N=O double bond (one sigma and one pi) and one N–O single sigma bond (with delocalisation of the pi electrons). HCONHCH₃ (N-methylformamide): The C=O double bond provides one sigma and one pi bond; the C–NH bond is sigma, the N–H and C–H bonds are sigma.",
    "explanation": "To identify sigma and pi bonds, one must note that a single bond is a sigma bond, while a double bond consists of one sigma and one pi bond. In cyclic and conjugated systems, the pi bonds may be delocalised.

The acidity order in (a) is explained by the strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of chlorine atoms, which stabilise the carboxylate anion more effectively when closer to the –COOH group. In (b), the electron-donating inductive effect of alkyl groups reduces acidity, so carboxylic acids with less alkyl substitution (and hence less electron donation) are more acidic.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Halogens are estimated by the Carius method, where the organic compound is fused with fuming nitric acid and silver nitrate forms a precipitate of silver halide. Sulphur is estimated by converting it into sulphate via oxidation and precipitating it as barium sulphate. Phosphorus is determined by oxidising it to phosphoric acid and precipitating it as an ammonium phosphomolybdate or as magnesium pyrophosphate after appropriate reactions.",
    "explanation": "Each element is converted into a form that can be quantitatively measured by gravimetric or titrimetric methods. The precipitates formed (AgX for halogens, BaSO₄ for sulphur, and phosphomolybdate or Mg₂P₂O₇ for phosphorus) are weighed and used to calculate the percentage of the respective elements in the original compound.",
