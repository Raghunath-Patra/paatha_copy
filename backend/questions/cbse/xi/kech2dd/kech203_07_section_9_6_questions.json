Their planar structure enables them to intercalate with DNA, which can lead to mutations and ultimately cancer.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Incomplete combustion of organic materials leads to the formation of complex mixtures of chemicals, including PAHs. These compounds, found in tobacco smoke, coal, and petroleum emissions, arise because incomplete oxidation results in partially oxidized species that recombine to form multi-ring structures. Variations in the combustion temperature, oxygen availability, and chemical composition of the fuel all influence the yield and type of PAHs formed. Therefore, reducing incomplete combustion through improved technology and environmental controls can significantly decrease exposure to carcinogenic compounds.",
    "explanation": "This question requires the integration of knowledge about combustion processes and the formation of PAHs. Different fuels produce varying amounts and types of PAHs, and the efficiency of combustion plays a critical role in their formation.
