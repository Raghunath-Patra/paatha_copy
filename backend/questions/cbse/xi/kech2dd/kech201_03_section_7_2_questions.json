    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Competitive electron transfer reactions involve different metals or species competing to release or accept electrons. In the reaction Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s), zinc loses electrons (oxidized) while copper gains electrons (reduced). The blue color of the Cu²⁺ solution fades as Cu(s) is deposited. The reaction proceeds almost completely to the right since the formation of Zn²⁺ and Cu(s) is highly favored, indicating that the equilibrium lies far to the products' side.",
    "explanation": "This reaction exemplifies competitive electron transfer where the metallic zinc is a stronger reducing agent compared to copper. Zinc's willingness to lose electrons causes Cu²⁺ to be reduced to Cu(s). The equilibrium heavily favors the products, which is evident from the near complete deposition of copper and loss of the blue color. This underlines the principle that electron-donating and accepting abilities dictate redox reactivity and equilibrium positions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both electron transfer reactions and proton release among acids involve a competitive process where species with higher tendencies either lose electrons or donate protons to others. In redox reactions, metals compete on the basis of their ability to lose electrons, similar to how acids compete based on proton donation. This analogy helps in building a metal activity series by comparing the relative ease with which different metals release electrons, thus predicting which metal will act as a reducing agent in a reaction.",
    "explanation": "The analogy is drawn from the observation that just as stronger acids more readily donate protons compared to weaker acids, more active metals more readily lose electrons compared to less active metals. This concept forms the basis for the metal activity series, where a metal higher in the series will oxidize and displace a metal lower in the series from its compound. Understanding this competition provides valuable insights into electron transfer reactions and galvanic cell design.",
