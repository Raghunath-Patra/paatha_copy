    "correct_answer": "For CH₂=C=O (ketene): the terminal CH₂ carbon is sp²‐hybridised and the central carbon (which is double‐bonded to both CH₂ and O) is sp‐hybridised; in CH₃CH=CH₂ (propene): the CH₃ group is sp³, the vinylic CH is sp² and the terminal CH₂ is sp²; in (CH₃)₂CO (acetone): the two CH₃ groups are sp³, and the carbonyl carbon is sp²; in CH₂=CHCN (vinyl cyanide): the CH₂ and the CH of the vinyl group are sp², while the carbon of the -CN group is sp (with the nitrogen also sp); in C₆H₆ (benzene): all carbon atoms are sp²‐hybridised.",
    "explanation": "Each molecule is analysed by recognizing the bonding around each carbon. Carbon atoms forming one double bond (or part of a cumulene system) adjust their hybridisation to achieve appropriate bond angles: sp for linear (as in the central carbon of ketene) and sp² for trigonal planar geometries (as in vinyl groups and benzene).

    "correct_answer": "C₆H₆ (benzene): Each of the six C–C bonds is a sigma bond with one delocalized pi system over the ring (six C–H sigma bonds present as well). C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane): Only sigma bonds are present (six C–C and twelve C–H sigma bonds). CH₂Cl₂ (dichloromethane): One carbon forms two C–H sigma bonds and two C–Cl sigma bonds. CH₂=C=CH₂ (allene): The molecule has two C=C double bonds (each comprising 1 sigma and 1 pi bond) plus four C–H sigma bonds. CH₃NO₂ (nitromethane): The CH₃ group contributes three C–H sigma bonds; the C–N bond is a sigma bond, and in the –NO₂ group the resonance structure shows one N=O double bond (one sigma and one pi) and one N–O single sigma bond (with delocalisation of the pi electrons). HCONHCH₃ (N-methylformamide): The C=O double bond provides one sigma and one pi bond; the C–NH bond is sigma, the N–H and C–H bonds are sigma.",
    "explanation": "To identify sigma and pi bonds, one must note that a single bond is a sigma bond, while a double bond consists of one sigma and one pi bond.

The acidity order in (a) is explained by the strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of chlorine atoms, which stabilise the carboxylate anion more effectively when closer to the –COOH group. In (b), the electron-donating inductive effect of alkyl groups reduces acidity, so carboxylic acids with less alkyl substitution (and hence less electron donation) are more acidic.",

    "correct_answer": "The three isomers of C₅H₁₂ exhibit different carbon skeletons: pentane has a straight chain, isopentane has a single branch, and neopentane has a highly branched structure. The differences in structure affect molecular surface area and the strength of the London dispersion forces. Generally, a straight chain (pentane) has a larger surface area, resulting in stronger intermolecular attractions and a higher boiling point, while increased branching (as in neopentane) reduces surface area, thereby lowering the boiling point.",
    "explanation": "Molecular shape plays a crucial role in determining physical properties. In alkanes, more branching leads to weaker intermolecular forces due to a decrease in contact surface between molecules.

    "correct_answer": "Resonance stabilization involves the delocalization of electrons over multiple atoms, resulting in structures that are a hybrid of several contributing forms. Benzene, for example, is not best described by a single structure with alternating single and double bonds; rather, its actual structure is a hybrid in which all C–C bonds are equivalent, showing bond lengths intermediate between single and double bonds. In nitromethane, resonance is depicted by the shifting of the negative charge between the oxygen atoms, stabilizing the molecule by distributing the charge. These resonance structures are not isolated but contribute collectively to a lower overall energy and greater stability.",
    "explanation": "Resonance structures illustrate alternative Lewis representations of the same molecule, with the actual structure being a hybrid that minimizes charge separation and maximizes covalent bonding.

In (CH₃)₃C⁺, nine C–H bonds can contribute to hyperconjugation, providing much greater stabilization. On the other hand, CH₃⁺ lacks any adjacent alkyl group and hence has no C–H bonds available for hyperconjugation, making it the least stable carbocation.",
    "explanation": "The stability of carbocations increases with the number of hyperconjugative structures possible. More alkyl groups mean more C–H bonds are aligned to donate electron density to the empty p orbital, thereby dispersing the positive charge.

    "correct_answer": "The resonance effect involves the delocalization of electrons among adjacent atoms in a molecule even in the ground state, as seen in benzene or nitromethane, where multiple contributing structures stabilize the molecule. In contrast, the electromeric effect is a temporary shift of electron density in the presence of an attacking reagent; for instance, in electrophilic addition reactions, the π-electron density of an alkene is shifted to one end when reacting with an electrophile. While resonance effects are inherent to the molecule’s structure, the electromeric effect only occurs during the actual reaction and reverses once the reagent is removed.",
    "explanation": "Resonance stabilizes molecules by averaging the contributions of several canonical forms in the absence of reacting species. The electromeric effect, on the other hand, is observed only in the presence of an external electrophile or nucleophile, leading to a temporary redistribution of electron density that facilitates bond formation or breaking during the reaction mechanism.",

    "correct_answer": "The test for halogens involves acidifying the sodium fusion extract with nitric acid and then treating it with silver nitrate. For chlorine, a white precipitate of AgCl is formed, which dissolves in ammonium hydroxide. For bromine, a yellow precipitate of AgBr is formed, which is sparingly soluble in ammonium hydroxide. For iodine, a yellow precipitate of AgI is produced, which is insoluble in ammonium hydroxide. The differences in precipitate color and solubility are due to the varying lattice energies and interactions between the silver ion and the different halide ions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The sodium fusion method is effective in converting covalently bound elements into detectable ionic forms, enabling the qualitative analysis of heteroatoms like nitrogen, sulphur, halogens, and phosphorus in organic compounds. However, interferences may occur if the compound contains multiple heteroatoms, such as simultaneous presence of nitrogen and sulphur, which can lead to the formation of sodium thiocyanate. This compound, when reacting with Fe³⁺, gives a blood red color instead of the typical Prussian blue, thus potentially complicating the interpretation of the nitrogen test. Additionally, excess sodium in the fusion process can decompose sodium thiocyanate into NaCN and Na₂S, which may interfere with the expected outcomes. Careful control of reaction conditions and sequential treatment steps, such as boiling with concentrated nitric acid to decompose interfering ions, are essential to minimize these issues.",

    "correct_answer": "In methane (CH4), the carbon atom is sp3 hybridised, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry with bond angles of approximately 109.5°. In ethene (H2C=CH2), the carbon atoms are sp2 hybridised, which produces a trigonal planar shape around each carbon with bond angles of around 120° and a planar structure essential for effective π bond formation. In ethyne (HC≡CH), the carbon atoms are sp hybridised, causing the molecule to be linear with a 180° bond angle. The type of hybridisation affects not only the geometry but also the bond lengths and strengths; for example, sp hybridised carbons form shorter and stronger bonds due to the higher s-character, and the presence of π bonds in multiple bonds introduces regions of high electron density that are often the sites for chemical reactivity.",
    "explanation": "The shape of a molecule is determined by the hybridisation state of the central atom. In methane, sp3 hybridisation leads to a tetrahedral arrangement, while in ethene, sp2 hybridisation creates a planar structure that supports a π bond necessary for the double bond. Ethyne's sp hybridisation results in a linear molecule.

    "correct_answer": "The greater the s-character in a hybrid orbital, the closer the electrons are held to the nucleus, which increases the electronegativity of the atom. For example, a carbon atom in an sp hybridised state (50% s-character) is more electronegative than one in an sp2 (33% s-character) or sp3 (25% s-character) state. This increased electronegativity affects properties such as bond strength, bond length, and reactivity. Compounds with higher s-character bonds tend to have shorter and stronger bonds, and the enhanced electronegativity can influence reaction mechanisms by making certain bonds more polar and more reactive toward electrophilic or nucleophilic attack.",
    "explanation": "Electronegativity is partially determined by how tightly an atom holds its electrons, which is a function of the s-character in its hybrid orbitals. Since sp orbitals have more s-character, they hold electrons closer to the nucleus, increasing electronegativity. This change affects molecular properties by altering bond polarity and bond strengths. For instance, in molecules where carbon is sp hybridised, the bonds tend to be shorter and stronger, and regions of high electron density in π bonds become focal points for chemical reactivity.",

Acyclic compounds, which include straight or branched chains, generally exhibit different physical properties and reactivity compared to cyclic compounds.

    "correct_answer": "Acyclic compounds, such as ethane or isobutane, have open chains and are generally flexible, showing typical alkane reactivity with low reactivity toward addition reactions. Cyclic compounds like cyclohexane or cyclohexene have ring structures; cyclohexane is stable due to its saturated, strain-free six-membered ring, while cyclohexene, with its double bond, is more reactive due to unsaturation. These structural differences influence properties such as boiling points, reactivity, and stability.",
    "explanation": "The open chain structure of acyclic compounds allows for free rotation around bonds, which leads to relatively lower reactivity and different physical properties. In contrast, cyclic compounds are more constrained and may display ring strain (as in cyclopropane) or stabilization through aromaticity, which significantly alters their reactivity.
