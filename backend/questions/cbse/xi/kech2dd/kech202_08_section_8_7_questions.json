    "correct_answer": "In chloroethane, the C–Cl bond is polar due to chlorine’s higher electronegativity compared to carbon. The electron density is drawn toward the chlorine, inducing a partial negative charge (δ–) on Cl and a partial positive charge (δ+) on the adjacent carbon. This positive charge can cause adjacent bonds to become polarized as well, although the effect diminishes with distance.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Resonance stabilization involves the delocalization of electrons over multiple atoms, resulting in structures that are a hybrid of several contributing forms. Benzene, for example, is not best described by a single structure with alternating single and double bonds; rather, its actual structure is a hybrid in which all C–C bonds are equivalent, showing bond lengths intermediate between single and double bonds. In nitromethane, resonance is depicted by the shifting of the negative charge between the oxygen atoms, stabilizing the molecule by distributing the charge. These resonance structures are not isolated but contribute collectively to a lower overall energy and greater stability.",
    "explanation": "Resonance structures illustrate alternative Lewis representations of the same molecule, with the actual structure being a hybrid that minimizes charge separation and maximizes covalent bonding.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Hyperconjugation is the delocalization of sigma electrons from C–H bonds in alkyl groups into an empty p orbital of an adjacent positively charged carbon. In CH₃CH₂⁺, there are six C–H bonds available for hyperconjugation from the attached methyl group. In (CH₃)₃C⁺, nine C–H bonds can contribute to hyperconjugation, providing much greater stabilization. On the other hand, CH₃⁺ lacks any adjacent alkyl group and hence has no C–H bonds available for hyperconjugation, making it the least stable carbocation.",
    "explanation": "The stability of carbocations increases with the number of hyperconjugative structures possible. More alkyl groups mean more C–H bonds are aligned to donate electron density to the empty p orbital, thereby dispersing the positive charge.

    "correct_answer": "The resonance effect involves the delocalization of electrons among adjacent atoms in a molecule even in the ground state, as seen in benzene or nitromethane, where multiple contributing structures stabilize the molecule. In contrast, the electromeric effect is a temporary shift of electron density in the presence of an attacking reagent; for instance, in electrophilic addition reactions, the π-electron density of an alkene is shifted to one end when reacting with an electrophile. While resonance effects are inherent to the molecule’s structure, the electromeric effect only occurs during the actual reaction and reverses once the reagent is removed.",
    "explanation": "Resonance stabilizes molecules by averaging the contributions of several canonical forms in the absence of reacting species. The electromeric effect, on the other hand, is observed only in the presence of an external electrophile or nucleophile, leading to a temporary redistribution of electron density that facilitates bond formation or breaking during the reaction mechanism.",
