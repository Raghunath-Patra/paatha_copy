Since the two fragments share one carbon from the double bond, the original alkene must contain 7 carbons. To yield a ketone with a carbonyl flanked by two ethyl groups (as in pentan-3-one) from one fragment and an aldehyde (propanal) from the other, the double bond should lie between C3 and C4 (when numbered appropriately).

In the presence of benzoyl peroxide the reaction proceeds via a free-radical mechanism (the peroxide effect), which results in anti-Markovnikov addition to produce 1-bromopropane.",
    "explanation": "Under normal conditions, the electrophilic addition to the double bond forms a more stable secondary carbocation, leading to 2-bromopropane. However, benzoyl peroxide initiates a free-radical chain process. In this mechanism, a bromine radical adds to the double bond to form a primary radical intermediate, which, being less stable, quickly abstracts a hydrogen atom to yield 1-bromopropane.

Such uniform cleavage products support Kekulé’s structure where the double bonds are not localized but rather are delocalized over the entire ring.",
    "explanation": "When o-xylene is ozonolysed, the ozonide formed is cleaved to yield products that indicate each bond in the benzene ring was equivalent.

    "correct_answer": "For ethyne, cyclotrimerization (e.g., over a red-hot iron tube) can convert acetylene directly into benzene.

Hexane can be converted to benzene through dehydrogenation and cracking (pyrolysis) processes, often as part of petroleum reforming.",
    "explanation": "Ethyne is known to undergo catalytic cyclotrimerization to form benzene. Ethene and hexane are less reactive; they must first be transformed (by dehydrogenation, dimerization or cracking) into unsaturated intermediates such as acetylene or other small hydrocarbons that can then cyclize and dehydrogenate to yield benzene.
