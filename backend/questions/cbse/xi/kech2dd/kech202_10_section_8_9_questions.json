    "correct_answer": "In the detection process, the organic nitrogen is first converted into sodium cyanide (NaCN) via sodium fusion. When the sodium fusion extract is boiled with iron(II) sulphate, sodium hexacyanidoferrate(II) is formed according to the equation: 6CN⁻ + Fe²⁺ → [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻. Upon acidification with concentrated sulphuric acid, some of the iron(II) is oxidized to iron(III). The iron(III) ions then react with hexacyanidoferrate(II) ions to form ferriferrocyanide, which precipitates as Prussian blue (Fe₄[Fe(CN)₆]₃·xH₂O). This deep blue compound is a complex coordination compound, and its formation indicates the presence of nitrogen.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The sodium fusion method is effective in converting covalently bound elements into detectable ionic forms, enabling the qualitative analysis of heteroatoms like nitrogen, sulphur, halogens, and phosphorus in organic compounds. However, interferences may occur if the compound contains multiple heteroatoms, such as simultaneous presence of nitrogen and sulphur, which can lead to the formation of sodium thiocyanate. This compound, when reacting with Fe³⁺, gives a blood red color instead of the typical Prussian blue, thus potentially complicating the interpretation of the nitrogen test. Additionally, excess sodium in the fusion process can decompose sodium thiocyanate into NaCN and Na₂S, which may interfere with the expected outcomes. Careful control of reaction conditions and sequential treatment steps, such as boiling with concentrated nitric acid to decompose interfering ions, are essential to minimize these issues.",
