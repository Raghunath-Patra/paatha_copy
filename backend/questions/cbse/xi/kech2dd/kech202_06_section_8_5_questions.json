    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The IUPAC nomenclature for alkanes begins with identifying the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms (the parent chain). For straight-chain alkanes, names end in '-ane' (e.g., methane, ethane, propane) and are named based on the number of carbon atoms. In branched alkanes, after selecting the longest chain (which must also allow the maximum number of substituents to be included), the chain is numbered so that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Substituent groups are named using the alkyl group naming convention, replacing '-ane' with '-yl' (e.g., methyl, ethyl). When multiple identical substituents exist, prefixes such as di-, tri-, and tetra- are used, and substituents are listed in alphabetical order. An example is 6-ethyl-2-methylnonane.",
    "explanation": "The answer should detail the steps: (1) choosing the parent chain, (2) numbering it to give substituents the lowest locants, (3) naming and ordering the substituents alphabetically, and (4) constructing the full name by combining the substituent names with the base name.

    "correct_answer": "For substituted benzene compounds, the numbering of the ring is done to give substituents the lowest possible locants. When there are two substituents, they are numbered as 1,2-; 1,3-; or 1,4- which correspond to the terms ortho, meta, and para respectively in the trivial nomenclature. In more complicated cases involving three or more substituents, the substituents are numbered based on alphabetical order and the lowest set of locants. Common names such as ortho (o-), meta (m-), and para (p-) are used as traditional descriptors, but for systematic naming, explicit numbering is preferred.",
    "explanation": "The explanation includes the step-by-step process: assigning carbon 1 to one substituent and numbering in the direction that minimizes the locant numbers for the other substituents. The discussion of the traditional ortho, meta, and para nomenclature shows how common names are derived from relative positions on the benzene ring and how IUPAC naming standardizes this through numbering.",

    "correct_answer": "To determine the name of a compound with multiple functional groups, first identify all the functional groups present. They are then prioritized according to the IUPAC hierarchy. The group with the highest priority (such as the carboxylic acid -COOH) becomes the principal functional group, and its corresponding suffix is used in the name. Other groups, such as a ketone (–C=O), are treated as substituents with appropriate prefixes like 'oxo-'. For example, in a compound containing both a –COOH and a ketone group, the compound is named as a carboxylic acid derivative (using the suffix '-oic acid') with the ketone indicated by the prefix 'oxo-' along with its position on the chain.",
    "explanation": "The procedure involves: (1) listing all functional groups, (2) referring to the priority order provided by IUPAC (with –COOH highest among the groups discussed), (3) numbering the longest chain starting from the end that gives the principal group the lowest number, and (4) naming the substituent functional groups appropriately.
