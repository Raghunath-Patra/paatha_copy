    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In methane (CH4), the carbon atom is sp3 hybridised, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry with bond angles of approximately 109.5°. In ethene (H2C=CH2), the carbon atoms are sp2 hybridised, which produces a trigonal planar shape around each carbon with bond angles of around 120° and a planar structure essential for effective π bond formation. In ethyne (HC≡CH), the carbon atoms are sp hybridised, causing the molecule to be linear with a 180° bond angle. The type of hybridisation affects not only the geometry but also the bond lengths and strengths; for example, sp hybridised carbons form shorter and stronger bonds due to the higher s-character, and the presence of π bonds in multiple bonds introduces regions of high electron density that are often the sites for chemical reactivity.",
    "explanation": "The shape of a molecule is determined by the hybridisation state of the central atom. In methane, sp3 hybridisation leads to a tetrahedral arrangement, while in ethene, sp2 hybridisation creates a planar structure that supports a π bond necessary for the double bond. Ethyne's sp hybridisation results in a linear molecule. These geometrical and bonding differences affect both the physical properties (such as bond length and bond enthalpy) and chemical reactivity, particularly in multiple bonds where the π bond electrons are more accessible to reagents.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The greater the s-character in a hybrid orbital, the closer the electrons are held to the nucleus, which increases the electronegativity of the atom. For example, a carbon atom in an sp hybridised state (50% s-character) is more electronegative than one in an sp2 (33% s-character) or sp3 (25% s-character) state. This increased electronegativity affects properties such as bond strength, bond length, and reactivity. Compounds with higher s-character bonds tend to have shorter and stronger bonds, and the enhanced electronegativity can influence reaction mechanisms by making certain bonds more polar and more reactive toward electrophilic or nucleophilic attack.",
    "explanation": "Electronegativity is partially determined by how tightly an atom holds its electrons, which is a function of the s-character in its hybrid orbitals. Since sp orbitals have more s-character, they hold electrons closer to the nucleus, increasing electronegativity. This change affects molecular properties by altering bond polarity and bond strengths. For instance, in molecules where carbon is sp hybridised, the bonds tend to be shorter and stronger, and regions of high electron density in π bonds become focal points for chemical reactivity.",
