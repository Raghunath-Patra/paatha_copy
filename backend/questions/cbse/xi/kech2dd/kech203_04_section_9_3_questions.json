    "correct_answer": "A sigma bond is formed by the head-on overlap of sp^2 hybrid orbitals and is strong, while a pi bond is formed by the lateral overlap of unhybridized p orbitals and is weaker. The presence of the weak, loosely held pi electrons in alkenes makes them more reactive towards electrophiles, as the pi electrons can be easily attacked in addition reactions.",
    "explanation": "In a carbon-carbon double bond, the sigma bond provides the primary framework and strength, with a bond enthalpy of about 397 kJ mol–1, whereas the pi bond, with a bond enthalpy of about 284 kJ mol–1, is more reactive due to its higher energy and accessibility.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Alkenes can be prepared from alkynes, alkyl halides, vicinal dihalides, and alcohols. From alkynes, partial reduction using Lindlar’s catalyst yields cis-alkenes, whereas reduction with sodium in liquid ammonia leads to trans-alkenes. Dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides with alcoholic KOH produces alkenes through elimination reactions. Vicinal dihalides react with zinc to form alkenes via dehalogenation, and alcohols undergo acidic dehydration to yield alkenes. Each method employs specific conditions that influence the stereochemistry and yield of the alkene.",
    "explanation": "The preparation methods differ significantly: using alkynes with Lindlar's catalyst allows controlled hydrogenation to cis-alkenes because the catalyst limits complete reduction; in contrast, using sodium in liquid ammonia favors formation of trans-alkenes through a different mechanism. Elimination reactions from alkyl halides and alcohols (dehydrohalogenation and dehydration, respectively) are influenced by the nature of the substrate and conditions such as temperature and solvent, which in turn affect the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of the products.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the electrophilic addition of HBr to propene, the pi electrons of the double bond attack the proton (H+), leading to formation of a carbocation intermediate. The more stable secondary carbocation is favored over a primary one, which results in the formation of 2-bromopropane following Markovnikov's rule. However, in the presence of peroxides, the reaction mechanism shifts to a free radical chain process, producing a radical intermediate that leads to anti-Markovnikov addition, hence forming 1-bromopropane as the major product.",
    "explanation": "Under normal conditions, the addition follows Markovnikov's rule due to the formation of a more stable secondary carbocation intermediate, which is quickly attacked by the bromide ion to form 2-bromopropane. When peroxides are present, the mechanism changes to a radical pathway where the stability of the radical intermediate controls the outcome. This leads to bromine attaching to the less substituted carbon, thereby yielding 1-bromopropane instead.",
