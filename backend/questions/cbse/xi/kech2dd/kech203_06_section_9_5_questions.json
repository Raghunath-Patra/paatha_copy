    "correct_answer": "Kekulé proposed a structure for benzene with alternating single and double bonds in a cyclic arrangement, which explained its formula C6H6 and one type of monosubstituted derivative. However, Kekulé’s model could not account for benzene’s unusual stability and equal C–C bond lengths. Later, the concept of resonance was introduced, proposing that benzene is a hybrid of two Kekulé structures. The delocalization of π electrons, depicted as a circle in the ring, explains the intermediate bond length (139 pm) and the extra stability of benzene, as observed in experimental data such as X-ray diffraction.",
    "explanation": "Early structural models proposed localized double bonds, but experimental evidence showed all C–C bonds in benzene are of equal length. Resonance theory, which considers benzene as a hybrid of multiple structures, rationalizes both the uniform bond length and the molecule’s resistance to addition reactions, confirming the stability offered by electron delocalization.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Activating groups such as –OH increase the electron density at the ortho and para positions through resonance donation, thereby facilitating electrophilic substitution at these positions. In contrast, deactivating groups like –NO2 withdraw electron density via a strong inductive (–I) effect and resonance, making the benzene ring less reactive overall. Additionally, –NO2 directs substitutions preferentially to the meta position because the ortho and para positions are significantly electron-deficient, whereas –OH directs electrophiles to ortho and para positions despite a slight –I effect due to its strong resonance donation.",
    "explanation": "The –OH group donates electron density into the ring, increasing its reactivity and preferentially stabilizing the intermediate sigma complex at ortho and para positions. Conversely, –NO2 withdraws electron density, deactivating the ring and directing electrophilic attack to the relatively electron-rich meta position. This fundamental difference explains the contrasting substitution patterns observed in aromatic compounds.",
