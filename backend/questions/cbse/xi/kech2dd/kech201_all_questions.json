    "explanation": "The ability of a compound to act as an oxidant or reductant depends on the possibility of further oxidation or reduction.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the reducing agent is in excess, there are more electrons available, pushing the oxidising species to a lower oxidation state. Conversely, when the oxidising agent is in excess, it withdraws more electrons from the reducing species, resulting in a higher oxidation state. Examples include: (1) The reaction of Fe3+ with excess Fe2+ produces Fe2+ (with insufficient oxidising power to convert all Fe2+ to Fe3+), (2) the oxidation of iodide with limited oxidant yields I– rather than higher oxidation state iodine compounds, and (3) in the oxidation of alcohols, excess oxidant can lead to the formation of carboxylic acids compared to aldehydes when the oxidant is limited.",
    "explanation": "The final oxidation state of a species in a redox reaction depends on the relative amounts of electrons donated and accepted. An excess of reducing agent provides enough electrons to force the oxidant into a reduced, lower oxidation state, while an excess of oxidant withdraws more electrons, oxidising the species to a higher state.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

(b) Chloride ions are oxidised by sulphuric acid under these conditions to form gaseous HCl, while bromide ions are more easily oxidised to elemental bromine, which is volatile and exhibits a red colour.",
    "explanation": "The reaction environment influences the outcome of redox processes. In the case of toluene oxidation, an alcoholic medium with KMnO4 restricts over-oxidation and facilitates the formation of benzoic acid.

    "correct_answer": "Thiosulphate reacts differently because the oxidising power of iodine is lower than that of bromine. Consequently, with iodine, thiosulphate is only partly oxidized to tetrathionate, while with the stronger oxidant bromine, it is oxidized further to sulphate.",
    "explanation": "The different outcomes arise from the relative oxidising strengths of I2 and Br2.

The Nernst equation is: E = 1.10 - (0.0592/2)*log(0.01). log(0.01) = -2, so the term becomes (0.0592/2)*2 = 0.0592 V.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the reaction 2 Na (s) + H₂ (g) → 2 NaH (s), electronegativity helps identify the movement of electrons. Sodium (Na) is less electronegative compared to hydrogen, which means sodium has a greater tendency to lose electrons and become oxidized. As a result, sodium donates its electron to hydrogen, forming sodium hydride. Hydrogen, being more electronegative, accepts electrons and is thus reduced. This illustrates that by comparing the electronegativities of the reacting species, we can ascertain the flow of electrons that defines oxidation and reduction.",
    "explanation": "Electronegativity is a key factor in determining redox behavior in reactions. Since sodium is electropositive and hydrogen is more electronegative, the electron transfer from sodium to hydrogen confirms that sodium undergoes oxidation and hydrogen undergoes reduction.",

    "correct_answer": "Initially, oxidation was defined solely as the addition of oxygen to a substance and reduction as the removal of oxygen. However, observations of reactions where hydrogen was removed (or added) and where other electronegative or electropositive elements were involved led to a broader definition. Examples include the oxidation of methane and the reaction of magnesium with halogens (F₂, Cl₂) or sulphur, illustrating that oxidation can occur through the removal of hydrogen or addition of electronegative elements. Similarly, the reduction reactions involve not only the removal of oxygen but also the addition of hydrogen or electronegative elements, as seen in the reduction of mercuric chloride by tin(II) chloride. This evolution has enabled chemists to classify and understand a wider range of chemical transformations as redox processes.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both electron transfer reactions and proton release among acids involve a competitive process where species with higher tendencies either lose electrons or donate protons to others. In redox reactions, metals compete on the basis of their ability to lose electrons, similar to how acids compete based on proton donation. This analogy helps in building a metal activity series by comparing the relative ease with which different metals release electrons, thus predicting which metal will act as a reducing agent in a reaction.",
    "explanation": "The analogy is drawn from the observation that just as stronger acids more readily donate protons compared to weaker acids, more active metals more readily lose electrons compared to less active metals. This concept forms the basis for the metal activity series, where a metal higher in the series will oxidize and displace a metal lower in the series from its compound. Understanding this competition provides valuable insights into electron transfer reactions and galvanic cell design.",

This method is systematic and easier to verify for both mass and charge balance, especially in aqueous solutions, but requires additional steps such as balancing H2O, H+, or OH- depending on the medium.",
    "explanation": "The oxidation number method involves assigning oxidation states, calculating the increase/decrease in oxidation numbers, and then balancing these changes. Its advantage lies in its simplicity for straightforward reactions. The half reaction method, on the other hand, isolates the oxidation and reduction processes, balancing each for atoms and charge before combining them. This makes it particularly useful for reactions in acidic or basic solutions where balancing of H2O and H+/OH- is required.

    "correct_answer": "In the reaction with HCl, Pb3O4 undergoes both an acid-base and a redox reaction because Pb3O4 contains PbO2 (where Pb is +4) and PbO (where Pb is +2). PbO2 acts as an oxidising agent, oxidising Cl– to Cl2, while PbO reacts to form PbCl2. In contrast, HNO3 is itself an oxidising agent, so the PbO2 portion does not further react redox-wise, resulting in a reaction that is predominantly acid-base with PbO reacting with HNO3 to form Pb(NO3)2 and leaving PbO2 largely unreacted. This difference in behavior highlights how the inherent oxidising or reducing nature of the acid can influence the reaction pathway.",
    "explanation": "Pb3O4 is considered a composite of PbO and PbO2. When reacting with HCl, the PbO2 portion oxidizes Cl– to Cl2 while the PbO portion undergoes an acid-base reaction to form PbCl2. With HNO3, since HNO3 is already a strong oxidising agent, it does not promote further oxidation of Cl–, and the redox reaction is suppressed in favor of acid-base reactions.

    "explanation": "Step 1: Write the half reactions:\nOxidation: 2 I^- → I2 + 2 e^-.\nReduction: MnO4^- + 2 H2O + 3 e^- → MnO2 + 4 OH^- (after balancing O by adding H2O and H^+ then converting to OH^- in basic medium).\nStep 2: Multiply the oxidation half reaction by 3 and the reduction half reaction by 2 to equalize electrons (6 electrons total):\n3(2 I^- → I2 + 2 e^-) gives 6 I^- → 3 I2 + 6 e^-.\n2(MnO4^- + 2 H2O + 3 e^- → MnO2 + 4 OH^-) gives 2 MnO4^- + 4 H2O + 6 e^- → 2 MnO2 + 8 OH^-.\nStep 3: Combine the balanced half reactions to obtain:\n6 I^- + 2 MnO4^- + 4 H2O → 3 I2 + 2 MnO2 + 8 OH^-.",

    "correct_answer": "Carbon goes from an oxidation number of -4 in CH4 to +4 in CCl4, resulting in an 8-unit increase. Therefore, 8 electrons are transferred per molecule of CH4.",
    "explanation": "In CH4, each H is +1 so carbon must be -4 for a neutral molecule. In CCl4, each Cl is -1 so carbon must be +4. The change for carbon is from -4 to +4 which is an 8 unit increase, corresponding to the loss of 8 electrons per molecule of CH4.",
