    "correct_answer": "The combustion analysis method involves the following steps: First, a known mass of the organic compound is placed in a platinum boat and burned in a combustion tube with pure, dry oxygen while in the presence of copper(II) oxide (CuO), which ensures complete oxidation of carbon to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and hydrogen to water (H₂O). The resulting gaseous products pass through an anhydrous calcium chloride tube that absorbs water, and then through a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution that absorbs CO₂. By accurately weighing the increase in mass of the absorption tubes, the amounts of water and carbon dioxide produced are determined. Using the stoichiometric relationships, the percentage composition of carbon and hydrogen in the original compound is calculated.",
    "explanation": "This procedure uses the principles of combustion and stoichiometry. The absorption steps allow isolation and measurement of each combustion product. The stoichiometric conversions (e.g., 44 g CO₂ corresponds to 12 g carbon, and 18 g H₂O corresponds to 2 g hydrogen) are used to compute the elemental percentages.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Dumas method involves heating the nitrogen-containing compound with copper(II) oxide in the presence of carbon dioxide to liberate nitrogen gas, which is collected (after removing CO₂ using KOH) and measured at adjusted conditions. On the other hand, the Kjeldahl method converts nitrogen in the compound to ammonium sulphate by digesting it with concentrated sulphuric acid. The released ammonia, upon reaction with sodium hydroxide, is then absorbed in a standard acid solution, and the excess acid is titrated to determine the amount of nitrogen. The Dumas method is faster and suitable for compounds where nitrogen is readily liberated as a gas, whereas the Kjeldahl method is more traditional and widely used but may not be applicable to compounds with nitrogen bound in resistant groups, like nitro compounds.",
    "explanation": "Both methods have specific applications based on the type of nitrogen present in the organic compound.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Kjeldahl method has several limitations: (1) It cannot be used for compounds containing nitrogen in forms such as nitro, azo groups, or in aromatic heterocycles because these do not convert to ammonium sulphate under the digestion conditions. (2) The method requires complete digestion of the organic matrix, and any incomplete digestion can lead to errors in nitrogen quantification. (3) The procedure is time-consuming, involves multiple steps including digestion, distillation, and titration, and demands careful control of experimental conditions to ensure accuracy. (4) Potential interferences from other substances in the sample may affect the titration results, leading to inaccuracies.",
    "explanation": "The Kjeldahl method, while being a standard method for nitrogen analysis, is challenged by compounds with resistant nitrogen bonds and complex matrices. These factors limit its applicability and can introduce errors if not carefully managed.
