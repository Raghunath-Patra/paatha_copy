Li₂ has a configuration incorporating a closed K-shell and (σ2s)², giving (4-2)/2 = 1 bond order and a diamagnetic nature due to paired electrons.

    "explanation": "In He₂, the 4 electrons are distributed equally between bonding (σ1s) and antibonding (σ*1s) orbitals, resulting in a bond order of (2-2)/2 = 0, which means no net attractive force is present, leading to instability. Similarly, Be₂, with electrons filling both the σ2s and σ*2s orbitals, also results in a bond order of zero.
