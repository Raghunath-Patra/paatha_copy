    "correct_answer": "The sixth period can accommodate 32 elements because in that period electrons fill the 6s orbital (2 electrons), the 4f subshell (14 electrons), the 5d orbitals (10 electrons), and the 6p orbital (6 electrons), totaling 2 + 14 + 10 + 6 = 32 electrons.",

    "explanation": "Atomic radius takes into account the size of the electron cloud, which does not have a precise boundary; different methods, such as covalent or metallic radii, are used depending on the type of element.

    "correct_answer": "Across a period, atomic radii decrease because the effective nuclear charge increases while electrons enter the same principal energy level; down a group, atomic radii increase due to the addition of electron shells that outweigh the increase in nuclear charge.",
    "explanation": "The decrease in atomic size across a period is due to electrons being added to the same energy level while the increasing nuclear charge pulls them closer.

    "explanation": "Since all the species have the same electron count, the primary factor affecting their size is the nuclear charge. A higher charge pulls electrons closer, making the ion smaller.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sodium has one electron in its outermost shell, which is relatively easy to remove, leading to a low first ionization enthalpy. However, after the removal, sodium attains a noble gas configuration, making the second ionization extremely difficult. Magnesium, on the other hand, has two outer electrons; its first ionization is higher than sodium's because it disrupts a stable configuration only partially, but its second ionization is lower compared to sodium's second because the resulting ion is less stable than a noble gas configuration.",
    "explanation": "The ease of removal in sodium for the first electron is due to its single loosely bound electron. Once that electron is removed, the remaining electrons are arranged in a highly stable noble gas configuration, which makes further removal difficult.
