    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sodium has one electron in its outermost shell, which is relatively easy to remove, leading to a low first ionization enthalpy. However, after the removal, sodium attains a noble gas configuration, making the second ionization extremely difficult. Magnesium, on the other hand, has two outer electrons; its first ionization is higher than sodium's because it disrupts a stable configuration only partially, but its second ionization is lower compared to sodium's second because the resulting ion is less stable than a noble gas configuration.",
    "explanation": "The ease of removal in sodium for the first electron is due to its single loosely bound electron. Once that electron is removed, the remaining electrons are arranged in a highly stable noble gas configuration, which makes further removal difficult.

Similarly, elements in the same group, like the alkali metals, share similar ns1 configurations, leading to similar chemical properties.",
    "explanation": "The periodic behavior of elements arises because electrons fill orbitals in a specific order (based on quantum numbers and energy levels).

The 4f orbitals are filled between cerium (Z = 58) and lutetium (Z = 71), forming the lanthanoid series.

However, anomalies occur for oxygen and fluorine due to their small size and the resultant electron-electron repulsions in the compact 2p orbitals. In oxygen and fluorine, the addition of an extra electron leads to significant repulsion among electrons, making the electron gain enthalpy less negative than expected.",
    "explanation": "Although a smaller atom with higher effective nuclear charge would favor a more negative electron gain enthalpy, the compact size of the 2p orbitals in oxygen and fluorine intensifies electron-electron repulsion. This repulsion counteracts the effect of the higher nuclear charge, resulting in a less negative value than predicted solely based on nuclear charge trends.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Atomic radii decrease across a period because adding electrons to the same energy level while increasing the number of protons enhances the effective nuclear charge, pulling electrons closer. Conversely, down a group, atomic radii increase due to the addition of new electron shells, which increases the distance between the nucleus and the outer electrons despite a higher nuclear charge; increased electron shielding reduces the net nuclear pull. For example, in period 2, Li has a radius of 152 pm while F has a radius of 64 pm. Down the alkali metals group, Li has an atomic radius of 152 pm, whereas Cs has a radius of 262 pm.",
    "explanation": "The trend across a period is dominated by a steady increase in effective nuclear charge with minimal change in shielding, resulting in a decrease in atomic radius. In contrast, when moving down a group, the addition of electron shells and increased electron-electron repulsion due to shielding outweighs the effect of increased nuclear charge, resulting in larger radii.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "First ionization enthalpy increases across a period because, with more protons added, the effective nuclear charge increases. However, anomalies such as boron having a slightly lower ionization enthalpy than beryllium occur because boron’s electron is removed from a 2p orbital, which is less penetrating and more shielded than the 2s orbital electron in beryllium. Similarly, oxygen has a lower first ionization enthalpy than nitrogen because of electron-electron repulsion in the doubly occupied 2p orbital. Down a group, ionization enthalpy decreases due to the greater distance of the outer electrons from the nucleus and increased shielding provided by inner electrons.",
    "explanation": "The concept of effective nuclear charge plays a key role in ionization enthalpy trends. Across a period, increased nuclear charge without a corresponding increase in shielding holds electrons more tightly, increasing the energy required to remove them. Anomalies arise when electron configurations, such as the difference between s and p orbital energies or increased repulsions in partially filled orbitals, alter these trends. Moving down a group, additional electron shells and increased shielding lower the ionization enthalpy.",

Elements on the extreme right have high electron gain enthalpies and high electronegativity, forming acidic oxides (e.g., Cl₂O₇ reacts with water to form HClO₄). Elements in the middle, where these trends are moderate, form amphoteric oxides (e.g., Al₂O₃ can react with both acids and bases). These trends show how fundamental atomic properties drive reactivity with oxygen.",
    "explanation": "Smaller atomic radii and higher effective nuclear charges contribute to higher ionization and electron gain enthalpies, which in turn affect how readily an element can either lose or gain electrons.

    "correct_answer": "The transition from Mendeleev's Periodic Law to the Modern Periodic Law signifies a paradigm shift because it replaced the concept based solely on atomic masses with one anchored on atomic numbers. This change was prompted by experimental evidence from Henry Moseley, who showed that the properties of elements were better correlated with atomic numbers rather than atomic masses. Consequently, this led to the realization that the electron configuration, which is determined by the atomic number, is the fundamental basis for the periodic variation in physical and chemical properties.",
    "explanation": "Mendeleev's law was based on the periodic recurrence of properties with increasing atomic mass, but anomalies existed that could not be explained until the discovery of subatomic particles. Moseley’s experiments provided the critical insight that the atomic number, representing the number of protons, was the more accurate organizing principle. This revelation confirmed that electronic configurations dictate chemical behavior, leading to the modern periodic law. The shift allowed for accurate prediction and synthesis of new elements, fundamentally changing the framework of chemistry.",

    "correct_answer": "The modern periodic table is structured to reflect electronic configurations dictated by quantum mechanics. The division into periods corresponds to the highest principal quantum number, and groups are arranged so that elements with similar valence electron configurations are aligned together. Lanthanides and actinides, which have f-orbital electrons, are separated into their own blocks because their electron filling and chemical behavior differ from the d-block transition metals. This separation is a direct consequence of quantum mechanical rules governing orbital energies and electron capacity.",
    "explanation": "The periodic table's arrangement, especially in its long form, is a visual representation of the electronic configuration of elements. Each period reflects the occupancy of electron shells, with the number of elements determined by the allowed quantum numbers. The lanthanides and actinides are placed in separate panels because their electrons fill the 4f and 5f orbitals, respectively, which possess different quantum properties compared to the outer s, p, and d orbitals.

    "explanation": "Follow the systematic rule: Break 120 into digits 1, 2, and 0. The corresponding roots are: 1 = un, 2 = bi, and 0 = nil. After combining as unbinil and adding 'ium', the name becomes unbinilium. The symbol is formed by taking the initial letters of the roots, which are U, B, and N, resulting in Ubn.",
