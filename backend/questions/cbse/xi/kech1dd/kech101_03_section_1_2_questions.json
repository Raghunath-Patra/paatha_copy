    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Increasing temperature generally increases the kinetic energy of particles, leading solids to melt into liquids (e.g., ice melting) and liquids to vaporize into gases (e.g., water boiling). Conversely, decreasing temperature reduces particle energy, causing gases to condense into liquids (e.g., water vapor condensing to form dew) and liquids to freeze into solids. Pressure changes can also affect state; for instance, increasing pressure can force molecules closer together, potentially leading to condensation.",
    "explanation": "The changes in states are based on the energy of particles. Heating provides energy that allows particles to overcome intermolecular forces, while cooling reduces this energy, allowing forces to bind particles more closely. Pressure can further influence the state by altering the space available for particles to move.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A compound's fixed composition means that the elements are present in exact ratios, which determines its chemical and physical properties. For example, water (H₂O) always consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, giving it unique properties like high specific heat and surface tension. In contrast, carbon dioxide (CO₂) is formed from one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, resulting in properties such as its role in respiration and its effect as a greenhouse gas. This fixed ratio is crucial because even slight changes can alter the behavior and characteristics of the substance.",
    "explanation": "The fixed composition of compounds ensures consistency in their properties. The predictable properties arising from specific atomic ratios allow compounds to be used in a wide range of applications and provide a fundamental basis for chemical reactions and behavior.",

Mixtures contain two or more pure substances, with variable composition, and can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Physical methods such as filtration, distillation, crystallization, and manual separation are used to separate mixture components since the individual substances retain their own properties.",
