    "explanation": "The equation K = e^(-delta G°/RT) clearly shows that the sign of delta G° directly impacts the equilibrium constant.

    "correct_answer": "Delta G represents the actual free energy change of a reaction at any given moment, while delta G° is the standard free energy change under standard conditions. The reaction quotient Q is the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants at any point, and Kc is the value of Q when the reaction is at equilibrium. When delta G is negative, the reaction proceeds spontaneously; when it is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous. At equilibrium, delta G equals zero and Q equals Kc. The equation delta G = delta G° + RT lnQ combines these concepts, showing how deviations from equilibrium (when Q ≠ Kc) affect the free energy change, thereby predicting the reaction's direction.",
    "explanation": "This answer integrates the concepts of delta G, delta G°, Q, and Kc to explain reaction spontaneity. It outlines how the standard free energy change (delta G°) and the actual reaction conditions (through Q) determine the overall free energy change (delta G). The student is expected to explain that when Q is less than Kc, lnQ is smaller than lnK, making delta G negative, which drives the reaction forward, while the opposite occurs when Q is greater than Kc.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Temperature directly affects the equilibrium constant Kc through the equation delta G° = -RT lnK. Higher temperatures can change the value of Kc depending on whether the reaction is exergonic (delta G° negative) or endergonic (delta G° positive). For exergonic reactions, increasing temperature may slightly decrease lnK if delta G° is fixed, while for endergonic reactions, a higher temperature makes lnK less negative, potentially increasing the reaction progress. The derivation assumes that delta G° is constant with temperature, even though in practice it can vary with temperature. This analysis implies that temperature shifts can alter the concentration ratios at equilibrium, affecting the spontaneity and extent of the reaction.",
    "explanation": "This response requires analysis of the temperature dependency inherent in the equation delta G° = -RT lnK. The answer should discuss how changes in temperature influence the exponential relationship between Kc and delta G°, noting that while the derivation assumes a constant delta G° over small temperature ranges, larger variations in temperature can affect reaction thermodynamics. The answer should evaluate the practical implications for both spontaneous (exergonic) and non-spontaneous (endergonic) reactions.",
