    "correct_answer": "Orbital promotion refers to the process of moving an electron from a lower energy orbital to a higher energy orbital to create the required number of unpaired electrons for bonding. However, it is not always a necessary prerequisite for hybridisation, as even filled orbitals may participate in the hybridisation process provided they are in the valence shell and have energies comparable to the orbitals being hybridised.",
    "explanation": "Although orbital promotion can help in forming more bonding sites by creating unpaired electrons, the text specifies that promotion is not an essential condition for hybridisation.

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "sp3 hybridisation involves mixing one s and three p orbitals from the valence shell to form four equivalent sp3 hybrid orbitals. In CH4, these orbitals point towards the corners of a tetrahedron, creating an ideal bond angle of 109.5°. In NH3 and H2O, while the central atom also forms four sp3 orbitals, the presence of one lone pair in NH3 and two lone pairs in H2O results in distortions. Lone pairs exert greater repulsion than bonding pairs, reducing the bond angles to about 107° in NH3 and 104.5° in H2O.",
    "explanation": "The tetrahedral arrangement in sp3 hybridisation leads to an ideal bond angle of 109.5°. However, lone pairs occupy more space and repel bonding pairs more strongly than bonding pairs repel each other.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In ethene, each carbon atom undergoes sp2 hybridisation, forming three sp2 hybrid orbitals that participate in sigma bonding, while one unhybridised p orbital from each carbon overlaps laterally to form a pi bond, resulting in a double bond (one sigma and one pi). This gives ethene a trigonal planar structure with bond angles close to 120° and a C–C bond length of 134 pm. In contrast, in ethyne, each carbon atom undergoes sp hybridisation, forming two sp hybrid orbitals that create a sigma bond when overlapping axially. The remaining two unhybridised p orbitals on each carbon form two pi bonds, resulting in a triple bond (one sigma and two pi) with a linear geometry and a shorter C–C bond length. The increased s-character in sp hybrid orbitals compared to sp2 contributes to stronger, shorter bonds in ethyne.",
    "explanation": "The type of hybridisation directly influences the molecular structure and bond properties. sp2 hybridisation in ethene leads to a planar structure with a moderate bond length due to the participation of one unhybridised p orbital in forming a pi bond. In ethyne, the sp hybridisation results in a linear structure with a higher s-character (50%), which brings the electrons closer to the nucleus and results in a shorter and stronger bond due to the formation of two pi bonds in addition to the sigma bond.",

    "explanation": "In a perfect tetrahedral arrangement (such as in CH4), the bond angle is 109.5°. However, in NH3, one of the sp3 hybrid orbitals contains a lone pair.
