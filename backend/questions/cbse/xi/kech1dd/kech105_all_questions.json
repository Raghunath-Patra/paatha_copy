    "correct_answer": "The standard Gibbs energy change is determined by the balance between the enthalpy change and the entropy change multiplied by temperature: Δr G° = Δr H° - TΔr S°. At low temperatures, the enthalpy term (Δr H°) dominates, whereas at high temperatures, the TΔr S° term becomes more significant. If Δr H° is negative and Δr S° is positive, the reaction remains spontaneous at all temperatures. In cases where both Δr H° and Δr S° are negative or positive, temperature can shift the spontaneity; for example, a reaction with both negative values may be spontaneous at low temperatures but become nonspontaneous at high temperatures. This interplay explains why some reactions only proceed favorably under certain thermal conditions.",
    "explanation": "This answer demonstrates the interplay between heat (enthalpy) and disorder (entropy) in determining the free energy change.

A large positive value implies that the formation of ozone is thermodynamically unfavourable under those conditions.",

This vessel is immersed in a water bath to absorb the heat released during the reaction. A thermometer inserted in the water bath records the temperature change. Since the calorimeter is insulated, the rise in temperature is due solely to the energy released by the reaction. Using the relation q = C × ΔT, where C is the heat capacity of the bomb plus water, the energy change (qᵥ) is determined. Because the reaction occurs at constant volume, no work is done (ΔV = 0) and the measured energy change is equivalent to the change in internal energy (∆U) of the reaction.",

    "correct_answer": "At constant volume, energy changes are measured using a bomb calorimeter, where the reaction occurs in a sealed container immersed in a water bath. This setup is ideal for reactions such as combustion where the volume does not change, so the observed heat change reflects the internal energy change (∆U). In contrast, constant pressure measurements are conducted using a calorimeter such as a polystyrene cup, where the reaction is typically carried out under atmospheric pressure. Here, the heat exchanged (qₚ) is directly equal to the enthalpy change (∆H) of the reaction. The constant pressure method is more suited for reactions in solution, like neutralization reactions, where volume is not artificially constrained. Key differences include the fact that bomb calorimetry avoids work due to volume change (ΔV = 0), whereas constant pressure calorimetry includes work done by the system if there were volume changes, although for many liquid-phase reactions the work is negligible.",

    "correct_answer": "Enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy are interrelated in determining reaction spontaneity. Even if a reaction is endothermic (positive enthalpy change), it can be spontaneous if there is a significant increase in entropy such that the term TΔS outweighs the positive ΔH, resulting in a negative ΔG. The Gibbs free energy equation, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, quantitatively combines these effects. A negative ΔG indicates that the process is spontaneous. In endothermic reactions, the absorption of heat is offset by the disorder introduced, such as an increase in the number of gas molecules, which drives the spontaneous nature of the reaction.",
    "explanation": "This answer details how both the heat exchange (enthalpy change) and the degree of disorder (entropy change) contribute to the free energy change.

    "correct_answer": "The third law of thermodynamics is significant because it states that the entropy of a pure crystalline substance approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero. This serves as a reference point, allowing the calculation of absolute entropies. To calculate the absolute entropy, one can integrate the heat capacity over temperature from 0 K to the temperature of interest, accounting for any phase transitions. For example, if the heat capacity data for a crystal are known from near 0 K to 298 K, the absolute entropy at 298 K can be calculated by summing the incremental changes in entropy (q_rev divided by T) along the temperature scale, and adding the entropy contributions from any phase transitions.",
    "explanation": "This detailed explanation clarifies that the third law provides a zero point for entropy. Using thermal data (heat capacities) and integrating the function q_rev/T over a temperature range, chemists can compute the absolute entropy of substances.
