    "correct_answer": "Enthalpy is extensive because its value depends on the amount of substance involved. In reaction enthalpy calculations, changing the stoichiometric coefficients (or the number of moles of reactants and products) scales the enthalpy change proportionally. For example, if a reaction is written for one mole of reaction and then the entire equation is doubled, the enthalpy change also doubles. This shows that enthalpy is not an intrinsic property of the substance but depends on the quantity present.",
