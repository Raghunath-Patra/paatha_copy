    "type": "Short Answer",

    "correct_answer": "The simple orbital overlap approach cannot explain the observed bond angles; for instance, without hybridization, CH₄ would have 90° bond angles, whereas in reality it has 109.5°. Similarly, NH₃ and H₂O would also show 90° angles if only pure orbital overlaps are considered. Hybridization accounts for these discrepancies by mixing orbitals to form new ones with directional properties that match experimental observations.",
    "explanation": "Pure orbital overlap only considers the interpenetration of atomic orbitals and does not provide insights into the directional nature of bonds.

    "correct_answer": "Bond formation in H₂ involves two hydrogen atoms approaching each other, where attractive forces (nucleus-electron attractions both within the same atom and between different atoms) outweigh repulsive forces (electron-electron and nucleus-nucleus repulsions). As they approach, the atomic orbitals overlap, allowing the electrons to pair. This process results in a decrease in potential energy, with a stable bond forming at an internuclear distance of 74 pm and a bond enthalpy of 435.8 kJ/mol.",
    "explanation": "The formation of H₂ starts when the attractive forces such as nucleus-electron attractions become significant as atoms approach. The overlapping of the 1s orbitals allows electrons to pair.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In CH₄, the ground state configuration of carbon has two unpaired electrons, but by promoting an electron from the 2s to the 2p orbital and then hybridizing these orbitals, four equivalent sp³ hybrid orbitals are formed. These hybrid orbitals are oriented tetrahedrally with bond angles of 109.5°, which matches experimental observations and overcomes the theoretical limitation of simple p orbital overlaps that would otherwise predict 90° angles.",
    "explanation": "The simple overlap of atomic orbitals would result in bond angles of 90° due to the orthogonal arrangement of p orbitals. However, carbon undergoes hybridization to form sp³ hybrid orbitals that are directed towards the corners of a tetrahedron. This new arrangement explains the observed 109.5° bond angle in methane, demonstrating the importance of hybridization in predicting molecular geometry.",

    "correct_answer": "One possible approach is to use computational chemistry software to simulate the electron density distribution in molecules that contain both sigma and pi bonds. Techniques like density functional theory (DFT) can map out the electron density contours. The experiment would involve comparing electron density along the internuclear axis (for sigma bonds) versus above and below the axis (for pi bonds). Validation could be done by comparing simulated spectra with experimental data such as X-ray diffraction or electron density mapping from advanced spectroscopic methods.",
    "explanation": "The simulation first involves constructing the molecular model and then using DFT to calculate electron density distributions.
