    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Resonance structures are several valid Lewis representations of a molecule that differ only in the arrangement of electrons. In ozone, two canonical forms with alternating single and double bonds combine to give a resonance hybrid with equal O–O bond lengths (~128 pm). In the carbonate ion, three equivalent resonance forms distribute the negative charge evenly among the oxygen atoms, resulting in bonds with partial double-bond character. This delocalization of electrons lowers the overall energy and increases molecular stability.",
    "explanation": "Resonance explains why some molecules cannot be accurately represented by a single structure. Instead, the actual molecule is a hybrid of all possible canonical forms. In O₃ and CO₃²⁻, resonance leads to average bond characteristics that are observed experimentally, such as equal bond lengths and enhanced stability.",

    "correct_answer": "NH₃ has a higher dipole moment than NF₃ because in NH₃ the dipole due to the N–H bonds and the lone pair on nitrogen are in the same direction, reinforcing each other. In NF₃, although the N–F bonds are polar, the lone pair on nitrogen contributes in the opposite direction, reducing the net dipole moment of the molecule.",
    "explanation": "The net dipole moment of a molecule is the vector sum of its individual bond dipoles. In NH₃, the trigonal pyramidal shape and the alignment of the lone pair with the bond dipoles result in a distortion that reinforces the dipole.
