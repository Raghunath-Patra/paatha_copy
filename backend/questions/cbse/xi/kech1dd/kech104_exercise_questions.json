    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A chemical bond is formed when atoms interact through either the transfer or sharing of electrons in order to achieve a more stable electron configuration (often an octet). In ionic bonding, electrons are transferred from a metal to a nonmetal resulting in the formation of oppositely charged ions that attract each other. In covalent bonding, atoms share electron pairs so that each atom can attain a stable configuration. The formation is driven by forces that lower the overall energy of the system, with the release of energy (bond enthalpy) marking bond formation.",
    "explanation": "When atoms approach each other, the attractive forces between their nuclei and the electrons (both intra-atomic and interatomic) overcome repulsive forces. In ionic bonds the electrostatic attraction between cations and anions stabilizes the structure, while in covalent bonds, the sharing of electrons through overlapping atomic orbitals stabilizes the molecule by achieving a full valence shell. This explanation is based on the principles of Lewis theory, valence bond theory, and molecular orbital theory.",

    "explanation": "Lewis dot symbols represent the number of valence electrons as dots around the atomic symbol. For Mg (group 2) there are 2 dots; for Na (group 1) there is 1 dot; B (group 13) has 3 dots; O (group 16) has 6 dots; N (group 15) has 5 dots; and Br (group 17) has 7 dots.",

    "explanation": "Lewis symbols depict the number of valence electrons. For a neutral S atom there are 6 valence electrons. When it gains 2 electrons to become S²⁻, it reaches a stable octet. Similarly, Al normally has 3 valence electrons; losing these electrons yields Al³⁺ with no valence dots. Hydrogen has 1 electron and gains another to form H⁻, achieving a helium-like duet.",

    "explanation": "Drawing Lewis structures involves counting total valence electrons, assigning a skeletal structure (usually with the least electronegative element in the center), placing electrons to satisfy the octet (or duet) rule, and then accounting for resonance if necessary.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons so as to have eight electrons in their valence shell, achieving a stable noble gas electron configuration. Its significance lies in helping predict the bonding and stability in many molecules, particularly among second-period elements. Limitations include the existence of molecules with incomplete octets (e.g., BeH₂, BCl₃), odd-electron species (free radicals), and expanded octets in elements from period 3 onward, thus the rule is not universal.",
    "explanation": "The octet rule is a useful guideline for predicting the structure and reactivity of many compounds. However, it does not apply to all elements or molecules.

SiCl₄ is tetrahedral with four bonding pairs. AsF₅ has a trigonal bipyramidal shape with five bonding pairs. H₂S has a bent shape due to two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, and PH₃, with one lone pair and three bonding pairs, adopts a trigonal pyramidal structure, though with larger bond angles than H₂S due to lone pair repulsion differences.",
    "explanation": "VSEPR theory predicts molecular geometry based on the repulsion between electron pairs. Molecules with no lone pairs adopt ideal geometries (linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, etc.), while the presence of lone pairs causes distortions resulting in bent or pyramidal shapes.

In H₂O, oxygen has two lone pairs and two bonding pairs, which results in a bent shape with bond angles of about 104.5°. The greater repulsion from the two lone pairs in water compresses the bond angle further compared to ammonia.",
    "explanation": "Lone pair electrons occupy more space than bonding pairs due to their higher electron density and lack of sharing with another nucleus. In H₂O, the two lone pairs on the oxygen atom cause a greater repulsive force compared to the single lone pair in NH₃, resulting in a smaller H–O–H bond angle.",

This delocalization of electrons results in all C–O bonds having an intermediate bond length and bond order of approximately 1.33. Resonance stabilizes the ion by spreading the negative charge over all the oxygen atoms.",
    "explanation": "Resonance structures are used when a single Lewis structure cannot describe a molecule accurately.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "No, the two structures for H₃PO₃ are not canonical resonance forms because they differ in the connectivity of atoms rather than merely the placement of electrons. Canonical forms of a resonance hybrid must have the same arrangement of atoms, differing only in electron distribution. In the given case, if the connectivity varies, they represent different structural isomers rather than resonance structures.",
    "explanation": "For resonance, the basic skeleton of the molecule must remain the same with only the electron positions changing; differences in connectivity indicate distinct compounds.

NO₃⁻ has three equivalent resonance structures with one double bond and two single bonds (each carrying a -1/3 charge) that alternate among the three oxygen atoms.",
    "explanation": "Resonance structures are drawn by shifting electrons (pi electrons and lone pairs) while keeping the atomic arrangement constant.

A sigma bond is formed by the end-to-end overlap of sp² orbitals, and a pi bond is formed by the side-to-side overlap of the remaining p orbitals. In C₂H₂, each carbon is sp hybridised, forming a sigma bond from the overlap of sp orbitals and two pi bonds from the lateral overlap of the two remaining p orbitals.",

    "correct_answer": "2py and 2py",
    "explanation": "When the internuclear axis is the x-axis, orbitals oriented along the x-axis (such as 1s and 2px) can form sigma bonds because their lobes overlap directly.

    "correct_answer": "According to valence bond theory, the H₂ molecule forms when two hydrogen atoms, each with a single electron in a 1s orbital, approach each other. Their atomic orbitals overlap to form a bonding molecular orbital (σ) with a lower energy than the individual atomic orbitals. This overlap of electrons with opposite spins leads to the formation of a covalent sigma bond that holds the two nuclei together.",

This results in a bond order of zero, indicating no net bond formation, hence Be₂ is not stable.",
    "explanation": "When the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals are equal, the stabilization provided by the bonding orbitals is cancelled out by the destabilization from the antibonding orbitals.

Superoxide is generally less stable than peroxide because of its higher electron repulsion and unpaired electron.",

    "correct_answer": "In PCl₅, phosphorus undergoes sp³d hybridisation, forming five hybrid orbitals that arrange into a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The axial bonds are longer because the axial orbitals experience greater repulsive interactions from the equatorial bonds, leading to a slight elongation of the axial bonds compared to the equatorial ones.",
    "explanation": "The trigonal bipyramidal structure results in two types of bonding environments. The equatorial positions have lower steric repulsion since they are 120° apart, while the axial bonds, which are 90° from the equatorial bonds, are subject to higher repulsion and thus become longer and slightly weaker.",

It is generally stronger than van der Waals forces but weaker than a covalent bond.",
    "explanation": "Hydrogen bonds result from the strong dipole-dipole interaction due to the high electronegativity difference between hydrogen and F, O, or N.
