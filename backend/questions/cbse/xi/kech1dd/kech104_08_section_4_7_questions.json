    "explanation": "The linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) is an approximation method used because the Schrödinger equation for molecules is too complex to solve exactly.

Destructive interference, where the wave functions subtract from each other, creates an antibonding molecular orbital with a nodal plane between the nuclei.",
    "explanation": "The concept of interference in wave mechanics explains the distribution of electron density in molecular orbitals.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The stability of a molecule depends on the number of electrons in bonding (N_b) and antibonding (N_a) orbitals, which is quantified by the bond order given by ½ (N_b – N_a). If N_b is greater than N_a, the molecule is stable. For example, in O₂, if there are more electrons in the bonding orbitals than in the antibonding orbitals, the molecule has a positive bond order and is stable.",
    "explanation": "A positive bond order indicates that the net attractive forces due to bonding electrons outweigh the repulsive forces from electrons in antibonding orbitals, thereby stabilizing the molecule. Conversely, if the antibonding electrons predominate, the bond order becomes zero or negative, leading to an unstable molecule.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The formation of molecular orbitals by the LCAO method requires that the combining atomic orbitals have nearly the same energy and the same symmetry with respect to the molecular axis. The energy matching ensures that the orbitals can effectively interact, while the symmetry requirement ensures the proper overlap geometry. When orbitals of the same symmetry and comparable energy interact, their wave functions can add or subtract to form bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. In contrast, orbitals with differing symmetry or vastly different energies do not combine effectively, limiting the regions of electron density available for bonding.",
    "explanation": "This explanation covers two essential criteria for orbital combination. Similar energy levels allow the atomic orbitals to interact with significant overlap. Meanwhile, symmetry alignment (such as the matching orientation along the z-axis) ensures that the electron density can reinforce (bonding) or cancel (antibonding) between the nuclei, which is critical in determining bond strength and molecular stability.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "According to molecular orbital theory, the bond order, defined as ½ (N_b – N_a), serves as an approximate measure of bond strength. A higher bond order indicates more electrons in bonding orbitals compared to antibonding orbitals, which results in a stronger attractive force between the nuclei and consequently a shorter bond length. Conversely, a lower bond order implies a longer, weaker bond. This relationship helps explain why molecules with double or triple bonds (higher bond orders) have shorter bond lengths than those with single bonds.",
    "explanation": "Bond order is directly linked to the strength of the bond between atoms: more bonding electrons mean that the nuclei are held more tightly together. The increased attraction leads to a decreased separation (bond length) between the atoms. This concept is critical in comparing the physical properties, such as bond lengths and energies, in diatomic and polyatomic molecules.",
