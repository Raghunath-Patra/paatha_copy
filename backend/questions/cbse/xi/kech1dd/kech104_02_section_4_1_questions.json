    "correct_answer": "The development of chemical bonding theories began with Kössel and Lewis who explained bonding in terms of electron configurations and the desire of atoms to achieve a noble gas configuration. Lewis introduced the idea of atoms having a kernel with a surrounding shell represented by dots. Later, Langmuir refined these ideas by eliminating the rigid cubical arrangement of electrons and introducing the modern concept of the covalent bond, where atoms share electron pairs rather than transferring electrons entirely. This evolution helped improve our understanding of both ionic (electrovalent) and covalent bonding, paving the way for modern structural theories.",

    "correct_answer": "Ionic bonding involves the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another, leading to the formation of charged ions (e.g., Na⁺ and Cl⁻) that attract each other via electrostatic forces, as seen in NaCl. In contrast, covalent bonding is characterized by the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, allowing each atom to effectively complete its octet (e.g., Cl₂, where each Cl shares one electron to form a bond). Both theories are based on attaining a noble gas configuration, but they differ in the mechanism of electron adjustment.",
    "explanation": "The answer should detail the process of electron transfer in ionic bonds and the electron sharing in covalent bonds, highlighting that while the ionic approach deals with separate ions achieving full octets through donation and acceptance, covalent bonding involves mutual sharing, as supported by examples such as sodium chloride for ionic and chlorine molecule for covalent bonding.",

    "correct_answer": "The octet rule is a useful guideline but has several limitations. It fails for molecules with an incomplete octet (e.g., BF₃ where boron has only six electrons), odd-electron species like NO where an electron remains unpaired, and molecules with an expanded octet such as PF₅ where elements in the third period or beyond can hold more than eight electrons. These exceptions occur because not all atoms have the same orbital availability or electron requirements as the second period elements.",
