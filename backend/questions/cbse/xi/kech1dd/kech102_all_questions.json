    "explanation": "The quantized nature of energy was first apparent when scientists observed that atoms emit light at specific wavelengths, forming discrete line spectra. Additionally, the photoelectric effect demonstrated that electrons are ejected only if the incident light frequency exceeds a certain threshold, regardless of intensity, implying energy is delivered in quantized amounts.

By precisely measuring the rate of fall of droplets and adjusting the voltage to make some droplets stationary, Millikan was able to determine the charge on each droplet. The key finding that the charge was always a multiple of a smallest unit (e) led to the conclusion that the electron carries a fundamental, quantized charge. This discovery provided strong evidence for the existence of subatomic particles and helped refine atomic models by emphasizing the quantized nature of charge within an atom.",
    "explanation": "The experiment's detailed measurements allowed for the precise calculation of the electron's charge.

Most of the alpha particles passed straight through the foil, while a small fraction were deflected at various angles and a very few were deflected back at nearly 180°. This led to the conclusion that the atom consists mostly of empty space and contains a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus. The experiment fundamentally challenged the Thomson model and established the nuclear model of the atom, where electrons orbit a concentrated central nucleus.",
    "explanation": "The scattering pattern observed showed that only a few particles experienced significant deflection, meaning most of the atomic mass and positive charge must be concentrated in a very small region (the nucleus).

    "correct_answer": "Classical electromagnetic theory predicts that electrons moving in circular orbits are under continual acceleration, causing them to radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. This loss of energy should lead electrons to spiral inward and collapse into the nucleus, rendering atoms unstable. However, this collapse does not occur. Modern quantum mechanics resolves this issue by proposing that electrons exist in discrete energy levels or orbitals rather than in defined classical paths. The quantization of energy prevents electrons from radiating energy continuously, thereby ensuring the overall stability of the atom.",

    "correct_answer": "Thomson applied perpendicular electric and magnetic fields to a beam of electrons in a cathode ray tube. When only an electric field was applied, the beam was deflected to one side, and when only a magnetic field was applied, it deflected to the opposite side. By carefully adjusting the strengths of these fields so that their forces canceled each other, Thomson brought the electrons back onto their original straight-line path. This balance allowed him to derive the ratio e/m from the measured deflections, since greater deflection implied a higher charge or lower mass. The precise determination of this ratio was a milestone that provided quantitative insight into the nature of the electron.",
    "explanation": "Thomson's approach leveraged the fact that the force on a charged particle in an electric field is proportional to its charge, while the force due to a magnetic field is proportional to both its velocity and charge.
