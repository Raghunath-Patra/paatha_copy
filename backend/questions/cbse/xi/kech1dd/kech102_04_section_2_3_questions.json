    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The quantization of atomic energy levels is supported by several experimental observations including the discrete line spectra of atoms, the photoelectric effect, and the distribution of black body radiation. In each case, energy is absorbed or emitted in discrete packets or quanta rather than in a continuous range.",
    "explanation": "The quantized nature of energy was first apparent when scientists observed that atoms emit light at specific wavelengths, forming discrete line spectra. Additionally, the photoelectric effect demonstrated that electrons are ejected only if the incident light frequency exceeds a certain threshold, regardless of intensity, implying energy is delivered in quantized amounts. Finally, the black body radiation curve could not be explained with classical theories until Planck proposed that electromagnetic energy is quantized, paving the way for modern quantum mechanics.",

    "correct_answer": "The Balmer series consists of emission lines in the visible region produced when electrons in hydrogen atoms transition from higher energy levels (n ≥ 3) to the n = 2 level. The wavelengths of these lines can be described by the formula v̄ = 109,677 (1/2² - 1/n²) cm⁻¹, indicating that the possible energies of the electrons are quantized.",
    "explanation": "In hydrogen, the discrete emission lines known as the Balmer series occur because electrons drop from higher energy levels to the n = 2 level. The quantization is revealed by the fact that the energies corresponding to these transitions can be described by a formula involving inverse squares of integers, which shows that only certain energy differences are allowed. These discrete energy differences correspond to the quantized energy levels specified by quantum theory.",
