    "correct_answer": "The Born-Haber cycle is used to indirectly calculate the lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound by breaking down its formation into multiple steps, including sublimation of the metal, dissociation of the diatomic non-metal, ionization of the metal, electron gain by the non-metal, and formation of the ionic lattice. Each step represents an enthalpy change and by summing these values using Hess's law, the lattice enthalpy can be determined.",
    "explanation": "In the Born-Haber cycle for NaCl: (i) Sublimation of Na(s) → Na(g) requires energy. (ii) Ionization of Na(g) → Na⁺(g) requires ionization energy. (iii) Dissociation of Cl₂(g) into Cl atoms takes half the bond dissociation energy. (iv) Electron gain by Cl(g) to form Cl⁻(g) releases energy (electron gain enthalpy). (v) Finally, the formation of the NaCl lattice from gaseous ions releases the lattice enthalpy.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The enthalpy of dissolution is determined by the balance between the lattice enthalpy of the ionic compound and the hydration enthalpy of its ions. If the hydration enthalpy is greater (more negative) than the lattice enthalpy, the dissolution will be exothermic; if not, it will be endothermic. For example, NaCl has a nearly neutral dissolution enthalpy because its lattice enthalpy (+788 kJ/mol) is almost balanced by the hydration enthalpy (–784 kJ/mol), resulting in a small net enthalpy change.",
    "explanation": "During dissolution, an ionic solid breaks up into its constituent ions. The energy required to break the crystal lattice (lattice enthalpy) is endothermic, while the energy released when ions interact with the solvent molecules (hydration enthalpy) is exothermic. The net enthalpy of solution (Δsol HΘ) depends on the values of these two factors. When the hydration energy overcomes the energy required to break the lattice, the process is exothermic; when it does not, the process is endothermic. This evaluation helps in predicting solubility trends and explaining why some salts dissolve more readily than others.",
