    "correct_answer": "One major limitation is Dalton's inability to explain the laws of gaseous volumes.

    "correct_answer": "Dalton's Atomic Theory was revolutionary because it introduced the concept that matter is composed of individual atoms that combine in fixed ratios to form compounds.

Although later refined, his ideas established the basis for identifying elements, understanding molecular composition, and advancing the overall structure of modern chemistry.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Dalton's Atomic Theory laid a foundational framework, but it was later modified as new evidence emerged. For example, the discovery of electrons, protons, and neutrons showed that atoms have internal structure, contradicting the notion of atoms as indivisible particles. Additionally, the theory could not explain the behavior of gases as articulated by the laws of gaseous volumes, an issue later resolved by Avogadro's hypothesis. Modern atomic theory also incorporates quantum mechanics to explain electron behavior, energy levels, and chemical bonding.",
    "explanation": "The answer must detail how subsequent discoveries, such as the subatomic particles and quantum theory, refined Dalton's original postulates. This critical evaluation should particularly focus on the transition from indivisible atoms to complex atomic structures and explain how these changes improved our understanding of chemical phenomena.",
