    "correct_answer": "The solubility of an ionic salt depends on the balance between the lattice enthalpy, which is the energy required to break the ionic lattice, and the solvation enthalpy, which is the energy released when the ions are surrounded by solvent molecules. For dissolution to occur, the solvation enthalpy must exceed the lattice enthalpy. Temperature can influence both these enthalpies: higher temperatures can increase solvation energy and provide sufficient energy to overcome the lattice energy, thus increasing solubility, whereas lower temperatures may not provide enough energy, resulting in decreased solubility.",
    "explanation": "The key principle is that the total energy change during dissolution must be favorable for the process to occur.

    "correct_answer": "In gravimetric analysis, the common ion effect is employed to precipitate nearly all of a target ion as a sparingly soluble salt. For example, silver ions can be precipitated as silver chloride by adding chloride ions, barium ions as barium sulfate by adding sulfate ions, and ferric ions as ferric hydroxide by adding hydroxide ions. By adding a common ion, the equilibrium shifts toward the formation of the solid, ensuring that almost all of the ion is precipitated. This precipitate can then be filtered, washed, dried, and weighed to determine the quantity of the target ion with high accuracy.",
    "explanation": "The principle relies on Le Chatelier's principle, where the addition of a common ion decreases the solubility of the salt, forcing the dissolved ions to combine and form a precipitate.

    "correct_answer": "The reaction quotient (Qc) is calculated using the same form as the equilibrium constant (Kc) but with the current concentrations of the reactants and products, regardless of whether the system is at equilibrium. By comparing Qc to Kc, one can predict the direction of the shift: if Qc < Kc, the reaction will proceed forward (to the right) to produce more products; if Qc > Kc, the reaction will shift backward (to the left) to form more reactants; if Qc equals Kc, the system is already at equilibrium. For example, consider the gaseous reaction H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g) with a given Kc of 57 at 700 K. If at a certain moment the concentrations are [H2] = 0.10 M, [I2] = 0.20 M, and [HI] = 0.40 M, Qc is calculated as [HI]^2 / ([H2] [I2]) = (0.40^2) / (0.10 × 0.20) = 0.16 / 0.02 = 8.

Water molecules surround each ion; the oxygen atom, having a partial negative charge, is oriented towards the Na⁺ ion, while the hydrogen atoms, with partial positive charges, are oriented towards the Cl⁻ ion.

    "correct_answer": "In the reaction Fe³⁺ (aq) + SCN⁻ (aq) ⇌ [Fe(SCN)]²⁺ (aq), increasing the concentration of SCN⁻ shifts the equilibrium to the right, forming more [Fe(SCN)]²⁺. Le Chatelier's principle states that the system will adjust to counteract the added reactant. This increase in product concentration can also modify the overall ion balance in solution, potentially affecting the conductivity. Conversely, decreasing the concentration of a reactant would shift the equilibrium to the left, reducing product formation. Such shifts are critical in controlling reaction outcomes and system properties.",

First, calculate 1/T₂ - 1/T₁: 1/550 - 1/500 ≈ 0.001818 - 0.002 = -0.000182 K⁻¹. Then, ln(K₂/0.05) = -(-92,380)/(8.314) × (-0.000182) = (92,380/8.314) × (-0.000182) ≈ 11108 × (-0.000182) ≈ -2.02. Thus, K₂/0.05 = e^(-2.02) ≈ 0.133, so K₂ ≈ 0.05 × 0.133 = 0.00665. This shows that for an exothermic reaction, an increase in temperature decreases the equilibrium constant.",

    "explanation": "Let x be the change in pressure for N₂ reacting. Initially, P(N₂) = 1.0 atm, and at equilibrium P(N₂) = 1.0 − x = 0.5 atm, so x = 0.5 atm. For H₂, the change is 3x; thus, P(H₂) = 3.0 − 1.5 = 1.5 atm. For NH₃, the increase is 2x, yielding P(NH₃) = 2 × 0.5 = 1.0 atm. The equilibrium constant in pressure terms is calculated by Kp = (P(NH₃)²) / (P(N₂) × (P(H₂)³)) = (1.0²) / (0.5 × (1.5)³) = 1 / (0.5 × 3.375) = 1 / 1.6875 ≈ 0.59 atm⁻², confirming the stoichiometry and equilibrium values.",
