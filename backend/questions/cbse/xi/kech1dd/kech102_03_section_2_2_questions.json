    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Millikan's oil drop experiment involved balancing gravitational force and electrical forces on tiny, charged oil droplets between two plates. By precisely measuring the rate of fall of droplets and adjusting the voltage to make some droplets stationary, Millikan was able to determine the charge on each droplet. The key finding that the charge was always a multiple of a smallest unit (e) led to the conclusion that the electron carries a fundamental, quantized charge. This discovery provided strong evidence for the existence of subatomic particles and helped refine atomic models by emphasizing the quantized nature of charge within an atom.",
    "explanation": "The experiment's detailed measurements allowed for the precise calculation of the electron's charge. Recognizing that the electrical charge was quantized, scientists could further develop atomic theories by incorporating subatomic particles with defined charges, leading to more advanced models that account for the organization of electrons in atoms.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Rutherford's gold foil experiment, a beam of high-energy alpha particles was directed at a thin gold foil surrounded by a zinc sulphide screen. Most of the alpha particles passed straight through the foil, while a small fraction were deflected at various angles and a very few were deflected back at nearly 180°. This led to the conclusion that the atom consists mostly of empty space and contains a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus. The experiment fundamentally challenged the Thomson model and established the nuclear model of the atom, where electrons orbit a concentrated central nucleus.",
    "explanation": "The scattering pattern observed showed that only a few particles experienced significant deflection, meaning most of the atomic mass and positive charge must be concentrated in a very small region (the nucleus).

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Classical electromagnetic theory predicts that electrons moving in circular orbits are under continual acceleration, causing them to radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. This loss of energy should lead electrons to spiral inward and collapse into the nucleus, rendering atoms unstable. However, this collapse does not occur. Modern quantum mechanics resolves this issue by proposing that electrons exist in discrete energy levels or orbitals rather than in defined classical paths. The quantization of energy prevents electrons from radiating energy continuously, thereby ensuring the overall stability of the atom.",
    "explanation": "The Rutherford model, when viewed through classical physics, implies that electrons should lose energy and fall into the nucleus. Quantum mechanics introduces the concept of stationary states, where electrons do not radiate energy while in these specific orbitals.
