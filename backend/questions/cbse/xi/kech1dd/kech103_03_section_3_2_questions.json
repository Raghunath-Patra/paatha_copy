    "correct_answer": "Both Lothar Meyer and Dmitri Mendeleev arranged elements in order of their increasing atomic weight and noticed periodic trends in their properties. While Meyer emphasized plotting physical properties such as atomic volume, melting point, and boiling point against atomic weights to reveal trends, Mendeleev arranged elements in a table ensuring that elements with similar chemical properties were grouped together. Mendeleev was also bold in leaving gaps for undiscovered elements and predicting their properties, a feature that solidified the acceptance of his periodic law.",
    "explanation": "Lothar Meyer used quantitative plots to explore trends, whereas Mendeleev focused on qualitative similarities by grouping elements with similar chemical behavior. The key difference was that Mendeleev left gaps predicting the existence of new elements, thereby providing predictive power to his table.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The concept of periodicity in chemistry evolved over time. Dobereiner first observed that groups of three elements (triads) shared similar properties and that the atomic weight of the middle element was approximately the average of the other two. Later, Newlands introduced the Law of Octaves by observing that every eighth element exhibited similar properties when elements were arranged by increasing atomic weight. Lothar Meyer furthered this idea by plotting the physical properties of elements against atomic weight, revealing periodic trends. Finally, Dmitri Mendeleev formulated the Periodic Law by organizing elements so that those with similar chemical behaviors were in the same group, even leaving gaps for undiscovered elements, which later confirmed his predictions.",
    "explanation": "The journey from triads to the modern periodic table shows a transition from simple observations of numerical relationships in atomic weights to more complex recognition of periodic trends in physical and chemical properties.
