    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Molecules with no lone pairs, such as those of types AB2, AB3, and AB4, follow ideal geometries like linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral, respectively. In contrast, molecules with lone pairs, such as H2O or NH3, experience increased repulsion due to lone pair electrons. This repulsion alters the ideal bond angles and distorts the molecular geometry, leading to bent or trigonal pyramidal shapes. The lone pair repulsions are stronger than bond pair repulsions and cause a reduction in bond angles compared to the idealized angles predicted by a symmetric electron pair arrangement.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the effect of lone pair electrons which are more repulsive compared to bonding pairs. Their increased repulsion results in smaller bond angles, altering the overall molecular geometry from the idealized shapes.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For an AB3 molecule without lone pairs, the ideal geometry is trigonal planar with 120° bond angles. In molecules like BF3, this ideal arrangement is observed. However, in NH3, even though an ideal configuration would be tetrahedral if all electron pairs were bonding, one of the electron pairs is a lone pair. This lone pair exerts a stronger repulsive force than bonding pairs, reducing the bond angles to approximately 107° and resulting in a trigonal pyramidal shape. These deviations illustrate how the presence of lone pairs can significantly alter the molecular geometry predicted by the idealized VSEPR model.",
    "explanation": "BF3 shows the ideal trigonal planar structure due to lack of lone pairs, while NH3 deviates from the ideal tetrahedral arrangement because the lone pair’s repulsion compresses the bonding pairs, reducing the bond angles. This comparison highlights how differing numbers of electron pairs (bonding vs. lone pairs) influence the arrangement and angles in molecular geometry.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "VSEPR theory is effective for many p-block molecules; however, its application becomes limited for molecules that can be described by multiple resonance structures. In such molecules, electron density is delocalized, and a single static electron pair geometry cannot accurately represent the dynamic distribution of electrons. This creates challenges in predicting precise bond angles and molecular shapes. Additionally, VSEPR does not account for differences in electronegativity or the specific orbital interactions involved. Experimentally, such molecules may display bond lengths and angles that are averages of several resonance structures, leading to deviations from predictions made by a simple electron pair repulsion model.",
    "explanation": "The limitations arise because VSEPR theory simplifies the electron distribution by treating all electron pairs as localized regions of charge. In molecules with resonance, the electron density is spread over multiple atoms or bonds, and this delocalization is not captured by the model. The result is that measured geometries may differ from those predicted, underscoring the need for more complex modeling in such cases.",
