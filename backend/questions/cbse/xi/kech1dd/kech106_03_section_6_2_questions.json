At a certain point, the curves level off, indicating that the rates of formation and decomposition are equal and the system has reached dynamic equilibrium. This visual evidence supports the concept that even when the system appears static in concentration, molecular processes continue in the forward and reverse directions.",
    "explanation": "The graph is significant because it provides a visual representation of how the reaction proceeds. Early in the reaction, noticeable changes in concentrations occur; however, as the equilibrium is approached, these changes diminish, highlighting that the system is dynamic at a molecular level even though macroscopic concentrations appear constant.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Isotopic labeling using D₂ allows chemists to track the movement of atoms during a reaction. In the ammonia synthesis experiment, when D₂ is used, the resulting ammonia contains various isotopic forms (NH₃, NH₂D, NHD₂, ND₃), as revealed by mass spectrometry. This indicates that even after equilibrium is reached, atoms are continually exchanged between molecules, demonstrating that the reaction remains dynamic with ongoing forward and reverse processes.",
    "explanation": "This approach shows that at equilibrium, the reaction does not simply stop; rather, it continues on the atomic level. The scrambling of H and D atoms confirms that isotopic exchange occurs, which provides direct evidence of the dynamic nature of chemical equilibrium.

    "correct_answer": "One can design an experiment by using two transparent jars and a flexible tubing system. Fill one jar with a coloured solution and leave the other jar empty. Connect the jars with two tubes (one for transferring liquid in each direction) and periodically exchange small volumes of the solution between them. Continue the process until the colour intensity in both jars remains constant. This equilibrium of colour, despite continuous exchange, illustrates that while individual molecules continue to move between jars, the overall concentrations (or colour intensity) remain unchanged—demonstrating dynamic equilibrium.",
    "explanation": "The experimental design mimics a chemical system at dynamic equilibrium. Just as in a reversible reaction where reactants convert to products and vice versa at equal rates, here the continuous transfer of coloured solution eventually reaches a point where the system's overall appearance remains constant. This analogy aids in understanding how equilibrium is maintained even though the process is continuously dynamic at the molecular or particulate level.",
