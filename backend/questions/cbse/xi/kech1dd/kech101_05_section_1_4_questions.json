    "correct_answer": "When rounding a number, if the digit to be removed is less than 5, the preceding digit remains unchanged. If the digit is more than 5, the preceding digit is increased by one. When the digit to be removed is exactly 5, if the preceding digit is even, it remains unchanged; if it is odd, it is increased by one.
