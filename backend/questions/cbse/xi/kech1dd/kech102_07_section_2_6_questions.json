It incorporates the uncertainty principle and provides detailed information about orbital shapes and electron distributions, making it applicable to multi-electron atoms where electron interactions are complex.",
    "explanation": "The Bohr model simplifies electron behavior by describing orbits with fixed radii, which works well only for hydrogen.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The (n + l) rule states that orbitals with lower sums of the principal quantum number and azimuthal quantum number have lower energy and are filled first. If two orbitals have the same (n + l) value, the one with the lower n is filled first. For example, 3d has n + l = 3+2 = 5 and 4s has 4+0 = 4, so the 4s orbital is filled before the 3d orbital in most multi-electron atoms.",
    "explanation": "This rule is used to predict the order in which electrons occupy available orbitals. The 4s orbital, with (n + l) value of 4, is lower in energy than the 3d orbital which has a value of 5, hence electrons populate the 4s orbital first.
