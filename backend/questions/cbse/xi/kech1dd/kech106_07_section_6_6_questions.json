    "correct_answer": "The reaction quotient (Qc) is calculated using the same form as the equilibrium constant (Kc) but with the current concentrations of the reactants and products, regardless of whether the system is at equilibrium. By comparing Qc to Kc, one can predict the direction of the shift: if Qc < Kc, the reaction will proceed forward (to the right) to produce more products; if Qc > Kc, the reaction will shift backward (to the left) to form more reactants; if Qc equals Kc, the system is already at equilibrium. For example, consider the gaseous reaction H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g) with a given Kc of 57 at 700 K. If at a certain moment the concentrations are [H2] = 0.10 M, [I2] = 0.20 M, and [HI] = 0.40 M, Qc is calculated as [HI]^2 / ([H2] [I2]) = (0.40^2) / (0.10 × 0.20) = 0.16 / 0.02 = 8.

For instance, if the initial concentrations are [H2] = 0.10 M, [I2] = 0.20 M, and [HI] = 0.40 M, then Qc = (0.40)^2 / (0.10 × 0.20) = 0.16 / 0.02 = 8.
