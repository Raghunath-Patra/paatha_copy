    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle significantly altered the classical understanding of atomic structure by stating that one cannot simultaneously determine the exact position and momentum of electrons. This undermines the classical idea of electrons moving in fixed orbits, as any attempt to precisely measure one of these quantities disturbs the other. The principle necessitates a probabilistic framework where the electron's location is described by a probability distribution rather than a determined path. This shift was critical in the development of the quantum mechanical model, which accurately describes atomic behavior at the microscopic level.",
    "explanation": "By demonstrating that precision in measurement is fundamentally limited, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle forces a re-evaluation of classical models such as Bohr's.
