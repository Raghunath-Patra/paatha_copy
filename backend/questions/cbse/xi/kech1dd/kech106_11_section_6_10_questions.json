For instance, in the reaction NH₃ + H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻, water donates a proton to ammonia, making water the acid and ammonia the base.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When NaCl dissolves in water, the ionic crystal lattice breaks apart due to the interaction of water molecules with the individual Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. Water molecules surround each ion; the oxygen atom, having a partial negative charge, is oriented towards the Na⁺ ion, while the hydrogen atoms, with partial positive charges, are oriented towards the Cl⁻ ion. The high dielectric constant of water (about 80) greatly reduces the electrostatic forces between these ions, helping them to remain separated in solution.",
    "explanation": "The dielectric constant measures a solvent’s ability to lower the electrostatic interactions between charged particles. In water, its high dielectric constant means that the forces holding the Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions together are weakened, allowing the ions to be stabilized by hydration.",

Unlike the Brønsted-Lowry definition, Lewis acids do not need to contain a proton. A typical example is the reaction between BF₃ and NH₃, where BF₃ is electron deficient and accepts a lone pair from NH₃ to form an adduct, BF₃:NH₃. This reaction illustrates that even without a proton, BF₃ acts as an acid by accepting electron density.",
