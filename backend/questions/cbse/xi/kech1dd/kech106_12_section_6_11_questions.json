    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The acid strength is influenced by two major factors: the strength of the H–A bond and the polarity of the bond. A weaker H–A bond requires less energy to break, making the acid stronger. Additionally, a more polar bond, due to a larger electronegativity difference between H and A, results in greater charge separation, facilitating proton donation. For instance, in comparing hydrogen halides, as the halogen becomes larger (from HF to HI), the H–A bond strength decreases due to increased bond length, even though the polarity decreases. This effect makes HI a stronger acid than HF.",
    "explanation": "A weaker bond means that less energy is required to donate a proton, and enhanced polarity increases the ease of ionization.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To calculate the pH of a weak acid solution: (1) Write the dissociation equilibrium equation, e.g., HF + H2O ⇌ H3O+ + F–. (2) Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. (3) Express the equilibrium concentrations in terms of the initial concentration (c) and the degree of ionization (α). (4) Write the expression for Ka: Ka = (cα)^2 / (c(1 – α)). (5) Solve for α, assuming α is small if applicable. (6) Calculate [H3O+] as cα and then pH = – log[H3O+]. For example, if c = 0.02 M and Ka = 3.2 × 10^(–4), solving gives α ≈ 0.12, leading to [H3O+] = 0.02 × 0.12 = 2.4 × 10^(–3) M, and pH ≈ 2.62.",
    "explanation": "This procedure involves setting up the equilibrium expression and using assumptions based on the small degree of ionization for weak acids.
