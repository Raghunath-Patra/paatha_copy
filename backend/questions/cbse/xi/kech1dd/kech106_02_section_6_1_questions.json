    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiment involves placing water in a sealed chamber connected to a U-tube manometer. As water evaporates, the added water molecules in the vapour phase increase the pressure inside the container, which is reflected by a rise in the mercury level in one limb of the manometer. Over time, condensation occurs, balancing the rate of evaporation. When the rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensation, the vapor pressure becomes constant, and the mercury level stabilizes. This constant level represents the equilibrium vapour pressure of water at that temperature.",
    "explanation": "The experiment demonstrates the dynamic equilibrium between evaporation and condensation. The slowly rising mercury indicates increasing pressure from water vapour until the system reaches a state where the net change in the amount of water in the vapour phase is zero. The stabilized mercury level directly measures the equilibrium vapor pressure.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a sealed soda water bottle, carbon dioxide is dissolved in the liquid under high pressure. The system reaches equilibrium because the rate at which CO2 escapes from the solution matches the rate at which it dissolves back, resulting in a constant concentration of CO2 in the liquid and a fixed vapour pressure corresponding to that pressure. In contrast, an open soda water bottle is exposed to atmospheric pressure, which is much lower. When CO2 escapes from the solution, there is no counterbalancing process to restore the dissolved concentration, and thus, the solution gradually loses CO2, causing it to turn 'flat.'",
    "explanation": "The sealed bottle maintains a closed system where Henry’s law governs the concentration of dissolved CO2 relative to its partial pressure. When the bottle remains closed, the dissolution and release of CO2 reach a balance. In the open bottle, the continual loss of CO2 into the atmosphere disrupts this balance, preventing equilibrium from being established.",
