The use of a cathode ray tube allowed scientists to observe that these rays travel in straight lines and exhibit deflections in electric and magnetic fields, demonstrating the presence of negatively charged particles. This discovery paved the way for further investigations into atomic structure, ultimately revolutionizing the field of chemistry and physics by providing evidence for the particulate nature of electricity and leading to the development of the modern atomic model.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Thomson applied perpendicular electric and magnetic fields to a beam of electrons in a cathode ray tube. When only an electric field was applied, the beam was deflected to one side, and when only a magnetic field was applied, it deflected to the opposite side. By carefully adjusting the strengths of these fields so that their forces canceled each other, Thomson brought the electrons back onto their original straight-line path. This balance allowed him to derive the ratio e/m from the measured deflections, since greater deflection implied a higher charge or lower mass. The precise determination of this ratio was a milestone that provided quantitative insight into the nature of the electron.",
    "explanation": "Thomson's approach leveraged the fact that the force on a charged particle in an electric field is proportional to its charge, while the force due to a magnetic field is proportional to both its velocity and charge. When these forces are balanced, the net deflection is zero and the relationship between the field strengths, electron velocity, and charge-to-mass ratio can be established.",
