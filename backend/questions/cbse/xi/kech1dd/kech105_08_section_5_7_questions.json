    "correct_answer": "The standard Gibbs energy change is determined by the balance between the enthalpy change and the entropy change multiplied by temperature: Δr G° = Δr H° - TΔr S°. At low temperatures, the enthalpy term (Δr H°) dominates, whereas at high temperatures, the TΔr S° term becomes more significant. If Δr H° is negative and Δr S° is positive, the reaction remains spontaneous at all temperatures. In cases where both Δr H° and Δr S° are negative or positive, temperature can shift the spontaneity; for example, a reaction with both negative values may be spontaneous at low temperatures but become nonspontaneous at high temperatures. This interplay explains why some reactions only proceed favorably under certain thermal conditions.",
    "explanation": "This answer demonstrates the interplay between heat (enthalpy) and disorder (entropy) in determining the free energy change. The temperature modulates the impact of the entropy change on the overall free energy and thus controls when the reaction becomes spontaneous (Δr G° < 0).",

    "correct_answer": "To calculate Δr G° for the conversion, use the formula Δr G° = -2.303 RT log Kp. Begin by substituting the values for R, T, and the given Kp into the equation. The negative sign indicates that a small Kp yields a positive Δr G°, signifying a reaction that is not spontaneous under standard conditions. The calculated Δr G° provides insight into whether the reaction favors formation of ozone or remains predominantly as oxygen. A large positive value implies that the formation of ozone is thermodynamically unfavourable under those conditions.",

    "correct_answer": "For a reaction where Δr H° is positive (endothermic) and Δr S° is negative (decrease in entropy), the equation Δr G° = Δr H° - TΔr S° will always yield a positive Δr G° irrespective of the temperature. This is because the term -TΔr S° becomes positive (since Δr S° is negative), and when added to the positive Δr H°, the overall free energy change remains positive. Therefore, such a reaction is nonspontaneous at all temperatures.",
