Among these species, the one with the higher positive nuclear charge will have a smaller radius due to the greater attraction of the electrons to the nucleus.",

    "correct_answer": "Electron gain enthalpy generally becomes more negative across a period as the effective nuclear charge increases, making it easier to add an electron. However, anomalies occur for oxygen and fluorine due to their small size and the resultant electron-electron repulsions in the compact 2p orbitals. In oxygen and fluorine, the addition of an extra electron leads to significant repulsion among electrons, making the electron gain enthalpy less negative than expected.",
    "explanation": "Although a smaller atom with higher effective nuclear charge would favor a more negative electron gain enthalpy, the compact size of the 2p orbitals in oxygen and fluorine intensifies electron-electron repulsion. This repulsion counteracts the effect of the higher nuclear charge, resulting in a less negative value than predicted solely based on nuclear charge trends.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Atomic radii decrease across a period because adding electrons to the same energy level while increasing the number of protons enhances the effective nuclear charge, pulling electrons closer. Conversely, down a group, atomic radii increase due to the addition of new electron shells, which increases the distance between the nucleus and the outer electrons despite a higher nuclear charge; increased electron shielding reduces the net nuclear pull. For example, in period 2, Li has a radius of 152 pm while F has a radius of 64 pm. Down the alkali metals group, Li has an atomic radius of 152 pm, whereas Cs has a radius of 262 pm.",
    "explanation": "The trend across a period is dominated by a steady increase in effective nuclear charge with minimal change in shielding, resulting in a decrease in atomic radius. In contrast, when moving down a group, the addition of electron shells and increased electron-electron repulsion due to shielding outweighs the effect of increased nuclear charge, resulting in larger radii. Ionic radii follow similar trends, with cations being smaller than their parent atoms and anions being larger due to changes in electron numbers relative to nuclear attraction.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "First ionization enthalpy increases across a period because, with more protons added, the effective nuclear charge increases. However, anomalies such as boron having a slightly lower ionization enthalpy than beryllium occur because boron’s electron is removed from a 2p orbital, which is less penetrating and more shielded than the 2s orbital electron in beryllium. Similarly, oxygen has a lower first ionization enthalpy than nitrogen because of electron-electron repulsion in the doubly occupied 2p orbital. Down a group, ionization enthalpy decreases due to the greater distance of the outer electrons from the nucleus and increased shielding provided by inner electrons.",
    "explanation": "The concept of effective nuclear charge plays a key role in ionization enthalpy trends. Across a period, increased nuclear charge without a corresponding increase in shielding holds electrons more tightly, increasing the energy required to remove them. Anomalies arise when electron configurations, such as the difference between s and p orbital energies or increased repulsions in partially filled orbitals, alter these trends. Moving down a group, additional electron shells and increased shielding lower the ionization enthalpy.",

    "correct_answer": "Periodic trends in atomic radius, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy, and electronegativity directly impact chemical reactivity. Elements at the extreme left of the periodic table have low ionization enthalpies and form basic oxides (e.g., Na₂O reacts with water to form NaOH). Elements on the extreme right have high electron gain enthalpies and high electronegativity, forming acidic oxides (e.g., Cl₂O₇ reacts with water to form HClO₄). Elements in the middle, where these trends are moderate, form amphoteric oxides (e.g., Al₂O₃ can react with both acids and bases). These trends show how fundamental atomic properties drive reactivity with oxygen.",
    "explanation": "Smaller atomic radii and higher effective nuclear charges contribute to higher ionization and electron gain enthalpies, which in turn affect how readily an element can either lose or gain electrons. These properties govern whether an element will exhibit metallic (basic oxide formation) or non-metallic (acidic oxide formation) behavior.
