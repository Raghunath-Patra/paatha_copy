Its unique behavior makes it difficult to classify in a single group.",

    "correct_answer": "Electron configurations determine the way electrons are arranged in an atom. This arrangement influences periodic trends such as atomic size, ionization energy, and electronegativity. For example, in period 2, filling of 2s and 2p orbitals leads to predictable changes from lithium to neon. Similarly, elements in the same group, like the alkali metals, share similar ns1 configurations, leading to similar chemical properties.",
    "explanation": "The periodic behavior of elements arises because electrons fill orbitals in a specific order (based on quantum numbers and energy levels). Elements in the same group have similar valence structures, resulting in comparable chemical reactivities.

    "correct_answer": "Helium has an electron configuration of 1s2, which would normally place it in the s-block. However, because its valence shell is completely filled, it exhibits properties similar to the other noble gases. For this reason, helium is positioned with the noble gases despite its s-electron configuration.",
    "explanation": "The complete filling of helium's 1s orbital makes it chemically inert, like other noble gases. This complete valence shell gives helium a stability and lack of reactivity that is characteristic of the p-block noble gases, thereby justifying its placement in that group.",

    "correct_answer": "In the 6th period, electrons are added to the 6s, then 4f, followed by 5d and finally 6p orbitals. The 4f orbitals are filled between cerium (Z = 58) and lutetium (Z = 71), forming the lanthanoid series. The lanthanoids have similar chemical properties because the 4f electrons are poorly shielded and do not participate significantly in bonding, resulting in comparable reactivity and ionic sizes.",
    "explanation": "This electron filling order explains both the expansion in the number of elements in the period and the unique properties of the lanthanoids. The inner transition series, with the filling of the 4f orbitals, shows that despite adding electrons, the chemical behavior is only slightly affected because the added electrons reside in inner orbitals.",
