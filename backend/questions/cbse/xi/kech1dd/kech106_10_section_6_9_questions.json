In contrast, weak electrolytes, such as acetic acid, only partially dissociate, producing fewer ions and lower conductivity. This difference is crucial because the degree of ionization affects both the reaction dynamics and the electrical properties of the solution.",

    "correct_answer": "In the reaction Fe³⁺ (aq) + SCN⁻ (aq) ⇌ [Fe(SCN)]²⁺ (aq), increasing the concentration of SCN⁻ shifts the equilibrium to the right, forming more [Fe(SCN)]²⁺. Le Chatelier's principle states that the system will adjust to counteract the added reactant. This increase in product concentration can also modify the overall ion balance in solution, potentially affecting the conductivity. Conversely, decreasing the concentration of a reactant would shift the equilibrium to the left, reducing product formation. Such shifts are critical in controlling reaction outcomes and system properties.",

    "explanation": "Let x be the concentration of [Fe(SCN)]²⁺ formed, so that the concentrations of Fe³⁺ and SCN⁻ become 0.005 - x. The equilibrium expression is K = x/(0.005 - x)². Substituting K = 100 gives 100 = x/(0.005 - x)² or x = 100(0.005 - x)². By defining y = 0.005 - x, the equation becomes 0.005 - y = 100y², which rearranges to 100y² + y - 0.005 = 0.
