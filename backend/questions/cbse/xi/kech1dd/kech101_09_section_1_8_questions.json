This precise determination is significant because it allows for definitive and reproducible calculations in stoichiometry, linking mass measurements to the number of particles and enabling accurate chemical reaction quantification.",
    "explanation": "By establishing a fixed relationship between the macroscopic mass (12 g of carbon-12) and the microscopic mass of an individual atom, chemists could define the mole in a precise manner.

    "correct_answer": "The mole concept simplifies chemical calculations by providing a direct link between mass and number of particles using the Avogadro constant. For example, if one needs to know the number of water molecules in 36.04 g of water, one first calculates the number of moles by dividing the mass by the molar mass (36.04 g ÷ 18.02 g/mol = 2.0 moles). Then, multiplying the moles by the Avogadro constant (2.0 moles × 6.022×10^23 molecules/mol) gives 1.2044×10^24 water molecules.
