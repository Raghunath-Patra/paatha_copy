    "question_text": "Which of the following best describes a reversible process in thermodynamics?",
    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": [
      "A process that can be reversed only by a significant energy change",
      "A process that proceeds quickly and is far from equilibrium",
      "A process that proceeds infinitely slowly through a series of equilibrium states",
      "A process that can never be reversed"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A process that proceeds infinitely slowly through a series of equilibrium states",
    "explanation": "A reversible process is defined as one that proceeds slowly, passing through a series of equilibrium states, so that an infinitesimal change can reverse the process. This ensures that the system and its surroundings are nearly in equilibrium at all times.",
