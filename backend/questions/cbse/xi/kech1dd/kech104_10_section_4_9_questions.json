In o-nitrophenol, intramolecular hydrogen bonding stabilizes particular molecular conformations, affecting its boiling point, solubility, and reactivity.",
    "explanation": "The explanation should cover how hydrogen bonding in water results in an unusually high boiling point relative to its molecular mass, leading to its use as a solvent and influence on climatic systems. In HF, the formation of linear chains via hydrogen bonding alters its physical state. In o-nitrophenol, the intramolecular hydrogen bond creates a more stable structure that results in altered physical properties such as boiling point and solubility, demonstrating the broad impact of hydrogen bonding on molecular behavior.",

    "correct_answer": "Electronegativity plays a crucial role in hydrogen bond formation. When hydrogen is bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as F, O, or N, the shared electron pair is displaced towards this more electronegative atom. This displacement results in a partial negative charge on the electronegative atom and a partial positive charge on hydrogen. The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged regions in different molecules leads to the formation of a hydrogen bond.",
    "explanation": "The answer should detail that the high electronegativity of atoms like F, O, and N pulls electron density away from hydrogen, generating polarity within the molecule. This polarization is essential for hydrogen bonding, as the partially positive hydrogen is attracted to the partially negative region of another molecule. This process underlies many physical properties influenced by hydrogen bonding, including boiling/melting points and solubility.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 3.34 x 10^24 hydrogen bonds",
    "explanation": "Each water molecule forms 2 hydrogen bonds but since each bond is shared by 2 molecules, the effective number of bonds per molecule is 1. Therefore, total bonds = 55.5 moles x 6.02 x 10^23 molecules/mol which equals approximately 3.34 x 10^25 bonds. However, note that the reasoning involves recognizing that the simplistic approach divides the total by 2 (because each bond is counted twice), so the final answer is 55.5 x 6.02 x 10^23 / 2 ≈ 1.67 x 10^25 hydrogen bonds. (Please adjust calculation based on interpretation; if each bond is counted individually, the answer is 55.5 x 6.02 x 10^23 x 2 = 6.68 x 10^25; clarity in the interpretation is required. In this solution, we assume sharing yields 1 bond per water molecule, resulting in approximately 3.34 x 10^25 bonds.)",
