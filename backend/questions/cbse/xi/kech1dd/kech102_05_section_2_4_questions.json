    "explanation": "In Bohr's model, electrons exist in fixed orbits with specific energies (stationary states). When an electron transitions from a higher orbit (n_initial) to a lower one (n_final), it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference between the two levels.

    "explanation": "While Bohr's model correctly explained the discrete energy levels in hydrogen, it failed to account for finer details in spectral lines and phenomena such as the splitting of lines under magnetic (Zeeman effect) or electric (Stark effect) fields. Additionally, it could not describe systems with more than one electron due to electron-electron interactions.
