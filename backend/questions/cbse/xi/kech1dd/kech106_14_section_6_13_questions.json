    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The solubility of an ionic salt depends on the balance between the lattice enthalpy, which is the energy required to break the ionic lattice, and the solvation enthalpy, which is the energy released when the ions are surrounded by solvent molecules. For dissolution to occur, the solvation enthalpy must exceed the lattice enthalpy. Temperature can influence both these enthalpies: higher temperatures can increase solvation energy and provide sufficient energy to overcome the lattice energy, thus increasing solubility, whereas lower temperatures may not provide enough energy, resulting in decreased solubility.",
    "explanation": "The key principle is that the total energy change during dissolution must be favorable for the process to occur. An increase in temperature generally enhances the endothermic aspects of the dissolution (like lattice energy overcoming) and the exothermic solvation process, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward greater solubility in many cases.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In gravimetric analysis, the common ion effect is employed to precipitate nearly all of a target ion as a sparingly soluble salt. For example, silver ions can be precipitated as silver chloride by adding chloride ions, barium ions as barium sulfate by adding sulfate ions, and ferric ions as ferric hydroxide by adding hydroxide ions. By adding a common ion, the equilibrium shifts toward the formation of the solid, ensuring that almost all of the ion is precipitated. This precipitate can then be filtered, washed, dried, and weighed to determine the quantity of the target ion with high accuracy.",
    "explanation": "The principle relies on Le Chatelier's principle, where the addition of a common ion decreases the solubility of the salt, forcing the dissolved ions to combine and form a precipitate.
