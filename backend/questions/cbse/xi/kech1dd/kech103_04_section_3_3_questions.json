    "correct_answer": "Moseley’s experiments demonstrated a direct relationship between the frequency of X-rays emitted and the atomic number of elements, thereby establishing atomic number as the defining property rather than atomic mass, which modified Mendeleev's periodic law into the modern periodic law.",

    "correct_answer": "Electronic configurations determine the arrangement of electrons in an atom and are responsible for the periodic recurrence of similar chemical properties across elements. This periodic variation in electron arrangements leads to the periodicity observed in the physical and chemical properties of elements and their compounds.",
    "explanation": "The periodic law is essentially a reflection of the periodic variation in electronic configurations. As electrons fill atomic orbitals in a predictable pattern, elements in the same group exhibit similar chemical behavior. This explains why, for instance, alkali metals share common properties due to their similar valence electron configuration.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The transition from Mendeleev's Periodic Law to the Modern Periodic Law signifies a paradigm shift because it replaced the concept based solely on atomic masses with one anchored on atomic numbers. This change was prompted by experimental evidence from Henry Moseley, who showed that the properties of elements were better correlated with atomic numbers rather than atomic masses. Consequently, this led to the realization that the electron configuration, which is determined by the atomic number, is the fundamental basis for the periodic variation in physical and chemical properties.",
    "explanation": "Mendeleev's law was based on the periodic recurrence of properties with increasing atomic mass, but anomalies existed that could not be explained until the discovery of subatomic particles. Moseley’s experiments provided the critical insight that the atomic number, representing the number of protons, was the more accurate organizing principle. This revelation confirmed that electronic configurations dictate chemical behavior, leading to the modern periodic law. The shift allowed for accurate prediction and synthesis of new elements, fundamentally changing the framework of chemistry.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The modern periodic table is structured to reflect electronic configurations dictated by quantum mechanics. The division into periods corresponds to the highest principal quantum number, and groups are arranged so that elements with similar valence electron configurations are aligned together. Lanthanides and actinides, which have f-orbital electrons, are separated into their own blocks because their electron filling and chemical behavior differ from the d-block transition metals. This separation is a direct consequence of quantum mechanical rules governing orbital energies and electron capacity.",
    "explanation": "The periodic table's arrangement, especially in its long form, is a visual representation of the electronic configuration of elements. Each period reflects the occupancy of electron shells, with the number of elements determined by the allowed quantum numbers. The lanthanides and actinides are placed in separate panels because their electrons fill the 4f and 5f orbitals, respectively, which possess different quantum properties compared to the outer s, p, and d orbitals. This structure not only organizes the elements by increasing atomic number but also reflects the underlying quantum mechanical principles of electron configuration and orbital filling.",
