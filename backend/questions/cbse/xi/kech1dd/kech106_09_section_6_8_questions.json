    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The addition of H₂ increases its concentration in the system, disturbing the equilibrium. This causes the reaction quotient Qc, defined as [HI]²/([H₂][I₂]), to become less than the equilibrium constant Kc. In order to restore equilibrium (i.e., to make Qc equal Kc again), the equilibrium shifts to the right, favoring the production of HI. This shift decreases the concentration of H₂ and I₂ while increasing that of HI, counteracting the initial disturbance.",
    "explanation": "According to Le Chatelier's principle, any change imposed on a system at equilibrium will be counteracted by the system to re-establish equilibrium.

    "correct_answer": "For exothermic reactions, such as the synthesis of ammonia (N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃), increasing the temperature causes the equilibrium constant Kc to decrease because heat is treated as a product; the reaction shifts to the left. In contrast, for endothermic reactions, increasing the temperature results in an increase in Kc, as heat is treated as a reactant. An example is the equilibrium involving [Co(H₂O)₆]³⁺ and [CoCl₄]²⁻, where cooling favors the formation of [Co(H₂O)₆]³⁺, resulting in a pink color.",
    "explanation": "Temperature changes affect the equilibrium constant because they alter the position of equilibrium. In exothermic reactions, higher temperatures favor the endothermic reverse reaction, thereby reducing Kc.

In the synthesis of ammonia, the use of an iron catalyst allows the reaction to reach equilibrium faster at a temperature where the yield of ammonia is still favorable, but it does not shift the equilibrium position itself.",
    "explanation": "Catalysts accelerate the attainment of equilibrium by lowering the activation energy for both the forward and reverse reactions equally. This means that while the reaction reaches equilibrium more quickly, the final concentrations of reactants and products remain determined solely by the thermodynamics of the reaction and not by the presence of the catalyst.
