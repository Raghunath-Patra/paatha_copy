    "correct_answer": "The formation of an ionic bond involves two key processes: the formation of gaseous ions through ionization (removal of electrons) and electron gain, and the subsequent arrangement of these ions in a crystalline lattice. While the initial steps may be endothermic, the energy released during the formation of the crystal lattice (lattice enthalpy) often overcompensates for the energy absorbed, leading to a net exothermic process that stabilizes the ionic compound.",
    "explanation": "This answer details that the ease of ion formation (ionization and electron gain) and the energy released when the ions are arranged in the crystal lattice together determine whether an ionic bond forms.

However, the lattice enthalpy of NaCl is -788 kJ/mol, which more than compensates for the energy required to form the ions. This large release of energy upon lattice formation drives the overall reaction to be exothermic, making the ionic bond formation favorable.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains that though forming ions is an energy-consuming process, the strong electrostatic interactions in the crystal lattice (quantified by lattice enthalpy) release sufficient energy to overcome the initial energy input.

    "correct_answer": "Achieving an octet in the gaseous ions is important for the electronic configuration; however, it does not ensure overall stability because the ionic compound's stability is largely determined by the lattice enthalpy. The energy released during the formation of the crystal lattice, which depends on the crystal geometry and coulombic interactions, is critical in stabilizing the compound. Therefore, even with octet satisfaction, insufficient lattice energy can render the compound unstable.",
