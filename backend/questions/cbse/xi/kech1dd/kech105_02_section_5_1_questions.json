This showed that the change in internal energy depended only on the initial and final states, not on how the work was performed, thus confirming that internal energy is a state function.",
    "explanation": "Joule’s method involved using mechanical paddles and an immersion rod for electrical work in a thermally insulated environment. The measurements of temperature change in both cases were identical, leading to the conclusion that work, regardless of its form, causes the same change in internal energy.

    "correct_answer": "Both mechanical and electrical work, when applied under adiabatic conditions, result in the same increase in internal energy by 1 kJ. This is because the internal energy is a state function and depends solely on the energy added to the system, not on the nature of the work done.",
    "explanation": "Under adiabatic conditions, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, so the entire energy change results from the work done on the system. Since 1 kJ of energy, regardless of the form, will raise the internal energy by the same amount (∆U = 1 kJ), the observed temperature change is the same.
