    "question_text": "What is the maximum concentration of equimolar solutions of ferrous sulphate and sodium sulphide so that when mixed in equal volumes, there is no precipitation of iron sulphide? (For iron sulphide, Ksp = 6.3 × 10⁻18).",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Write the precipitation reaction: FeS (s) ⇌ Fe2+ + S^2–; for equimolar solutions mixed in equal volumes, the concentrations are halved. Set up the condition (C/2)^2 = Ksp and solve for C. The maximum concentration C_max = 2√(Ksp) ≈ 2×(7.94×10⁻10) ≈ 1.59×10⁻9 M.",
    "explanation": "The condition for no precipitation is that the ionic product must not exceed Ksp. With mixing, concentrations are diluted; solving the relation gives the maximum allowable concentration.",

    "correct_answer": "Molar mass of CaSO4 ≈ 136.14 g/mol, so 1 g corresponds to 0.00734 mol. The solubility in mol/L, S = sqrt(Ksp) (for CaSO4 which dissolves into Ca2+ and SO4^2–) ≈ sqrt(9.1×10⁻6) ≈ 0.00302 M. Volume required = moles/S ≈ 0.00734/0.00302 ≈ 2.43 L.",

    "correct_answer": "Precipitation will occur in the solution where the product [M^n+][S^2–] exceeds the Ksp for that metal sulphide. Based on typical very low Ksp values, precipitation is most likely with FeSO4 and CdCl2.",
