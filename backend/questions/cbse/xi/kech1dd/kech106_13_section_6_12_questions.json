    "correct_answer": "To design such a buffer, use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([Salt]/[Acid]). Plugging in the values: 5.50 = 5.00 + log([Salt]/[Acid]). This gives log([Salt]/[Acid]) = 0.50. Taking the antilog, [Salt]/[Acid] = 10^0.50 ≈ 3.16. Therefore, the concentration of the salt should be about 3.16 times that of the acid.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For an acidic buffer, a weak acid and its salt formed with a strong base are used. The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation pH = pKa + log([Salt]/[Acid]) applies directly, meaning that when the salt and acid are in equal amounts, pH equals pKa. In contrast, a basic buffer is prepared using a weak base and its salt formed with a strong acid; the derived equation similarly becomes pH = pKa + log([Conjugate acid]/[Base]) after accounting for the relationship between pKa, pKb, and pw. While both buffer types rely on the ratio of conjugate pairs, acidic buffers are typically used in systems requiring low pH (such as blood plasma) and basic buffers in systems requiring high pH (such as some biochemical assays). The choice of buffer depends on the target pH and the availability of appropriate weak acid/base pairs.",
