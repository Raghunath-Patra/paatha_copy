    "correct_answer": "Enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy are interrelated in determining reaction spontaneity. Even if a reaction is endothermic (positive enthalpy change), it can be spontaneous if there is a significant increase in entropy such that the term TΔS outweighs the positive ΔH, resulting in a negative ΔG. The Gibbs free energy equation, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, quantitatively combines these effects. A negative ΔG indicates that the process is spontaneous. In endothermic reactions, the absorption of heat is offset by the disorder introduced, such as an increase in the number of gas molecules, which drives the spontaneous nature of the reaction.",
    "explanation": "This answer details how both the heat exchange (enthalpy change) and the degree of disorder (entropy change) contribute to the free energy change. The equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS serves as a comprehensive criterion for spontaneity. Reactions that are endothermic can be spontaneous if the entropy increase is large enough, illustrating the balance between energy and disorder.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The third law of thermodynamics is significant because it states that the entropy of a pure crystalline substance approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero. This serves as a reference point, allowing the calculation of absolute entropies. To calculate the absolute entropy, one can integrate the heat capacity over temperature from 0 K to the temperature of interest, accounting for any phase transitions. For example, if the heat capacity data for a crystal are known from near 0 K to 298 K, the absolute entropy at 298 K can be calculated by summing the incremental changes in entropy (q_rev divided by T) along the temperature scale, and adding the entropy contributions from any phase transitions.",
    "explanation": "This detailed explanation clarifies that the third law provides a zero point for entropy. Using thermal data (heat capacities) and integrating the function q_rev/T over a temperature range, chemists can compute the absolute entropy of substances. This method is analogous to performing a Hess’s Law type calculation for entropy.",
