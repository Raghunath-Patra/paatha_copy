    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A bomb calorimeter consists of a sealed steel vessel (the bomb) in which the reaction, typically combustion, occurs at constant volume. This vessel is immersed in a water bath to absorb the heat released during the reaction. A thermometer inserted in the water bath records the temperature change. Since the calorimeter is insulated, the rise in temperature is due solely to the energy released by the reaction. Using the relation q = C × ΔT, where C is the heat capacity of the bomb plus water, the energy change (qᵥ) is determined. Because the reaction occurs at constant volume, no work is done (ΔV = 0) and the measured energy change is equivalent to the change in internal energy (∆U) of the reaction.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "At constant volume, energy changes are measured using a bomb calorimeter, where the reaction occurs in a sealed container immersed in a water bath. This setup is ideal for reactions such as combustion where the volume does not change, so the observed heat change reflects the internal energy change (∆U). In contrast, constant pressure measurements are conducted using a calorimeter such as a polystyrene cup, where the reaction is typically carried out under atmospheric pressure. Here, the heat exchanged (qₚ) is directly equal to the enthalpy change (∆H) of the reaction. The constant pressure method is more suited for reactions in solution, like neutralization reactions, where volume is not artificially constrained. Key differences include the fact that bomb calorimetry avoids work due to volume change (ΔV = 0), whereas constant pressure calorimetry includes work done by the system if there were volume changes, although for many liquid-phase reactions the work is negligible.",
