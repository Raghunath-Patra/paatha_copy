Pressure changes can also affect state; for instance, increasing pressure can force molecules closer together, potentially leading to condensation.",

For example, water's boiling point (100°C) is a physical property, while its ability to react with certain substances to form different compounds is a chemical property.",

    "correct_answer": "The mole concept simplifies chemical calculations by providing a direct link between mass and number of particles using the Avogadro constant. For example, if one needs to know the number of water molecules in 36.04 g of water, one first calculates the number of moles by dividing the mass by the molar mass (36.04 g ÷ 18.02 g/mol = 2.0 moles). Then, multiplying the moles by the Avogadro constant (2.0 moles × 6.022×10^23 molecules/mol) gives 1.2044×10^24 water molecules. This avoids dealing with extremely large numbers directly and standardizes chemical measurements.",

Although later refined, his ideas established the basis for identifying elements, understanding molecular composition, and advancing the overall structure of modern chemistry.",

    "correct_answer": "Dalton's Atomic Theory laid a foundational framework, but it was later modified as new evidence emerged. For example, the discovery of electrons, protons, and neutrons showed that atoms have internal structure, contradicting the notion of atoms as indivisible particles. Additionally, the theory could not explain the behavior of gases as articulated by the laws of gaseous volumes, an issue later resolved by Avogadro's hypothesis. Modern atomic theory also incorporates quantum mechanics to explain electron behavior, energy levels, and chemical bonding.",
    "explanation": "The answer must detail how subsequent discoveries, such as the subatomic particles and quantum theory, refined Dalton's original postulates.

    "question_text": "A compound is analyzed and found to be composed of 10.0% hydrogen, 40.0% carbon, and 50.0% oxygen by mass. If the molar mass of the compound is 180.0 g/mol, find both its empirical and molecular formulas.",

    "correct_answer": "Empirical formula is CH₂O and molecular formula is C₆H₁₂O₆.",
    "explanation": "Assume a 100 g sample so that H = 10.0 g, C = 40.0 g, O = 50.0 g. Moles: H = 10.0/1.008 ≈ 9.92, C = 40.0/12.01 ≈ 3.33, O = 50.0/16.00 = 3.125. Dividing by ≈3.125 gives ratio: H ≈3.17, C ≈1.07, O =1 which approximates to CH₂O. Empirical mass = 30.03 g. Molecular factor = 180.0/30.03 ≈ 6, so molecular formula = C₆H₁₂O₆.",

    "question_text": "A research chemist prepared a compound and measured its percentage composition to be 4.07% hydrogen, 24.27% carbon, and 71.65% chlorine. Critically analyze potential experimental errors that might impact these measurements and suggest methods to minimize these errors.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Potential errors include weighing inaccuracies, incomplete combustion in analysis, instrument calibration issues, and contamination. To minimize errors, the chemist should calibrate instruments regularly, use high-purity reagents, perform replicate analyses, and ensure complete sample combustion or use alternative precise analytical techniques.",
    "explanation": "Experimental errors can stem from both human and instrumental sources. By using calibrated equipment, controlled conditions, and performing multiple measurements, the reliability of the percentage composition analysis is increased. These practices help in obtaining accurate empirical and molecular formulas.",
