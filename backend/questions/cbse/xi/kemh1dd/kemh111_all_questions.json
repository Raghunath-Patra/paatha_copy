The XOY plane divides space into regions above (where z > 0) and below (where z < 0). Similarly, the YOZ and ZOX planes divide space based on the signs of x and y respectively. Combining these divisions, a point in space will have a unique sign combination for x, y, and z (each can be either positive or negative).

In contrast, a three-dimensional coordinate system adds a third coordinate (z) to represent height or depth, making it ideal for describing real-life positions such as the location of an object in a room or the trajectory of an airplane in space. While both systems rely on perpendicular axes to define positions, the additional dimension in 3D provides a more comprehensive spatial representation.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains that 2D systems suffice for flat surfaces (like maps), using only two perpendicular axes. However, to capture the vertical dimension—essential for many real-world applications such as in architecture or flight paths—a third axis is introduced, allowing the complete location to be represented as (x, y, z).

The proof follows by establishing that for every point in space, these distances are uniquely determined by its projections onto the three coordinate planes. Conversely, given any three non-negative distances (with appropriate signs to indicate direction), one can reconstruct a unique point in space. This bi-directional correspondence between point location and perpendicular distances confirms that three coordinates are both necessary and sufficient to completely describe positions in space.",
    "explanation": "The explanation starts by assigning perpendicular distances to each coordinate plane based on the point's position. By demonstrating that the set of distances (x, y, z) uniquely maps to a point in space and vice versa, the proof relies on the uniqueness of projections and the properties of the Cartesian system.

    "correct_answer": "To prove the one-to-one correspondence, we show that every point P in space can be uniquely identified by an ordered triplet (x, y, z) and vice versa. First, given any point P, we can drop a perpendicular to the XY-plane at M, so that M has coordinates (x, y, 0). Then the distance from M to P along the z-axis gives the coordinate z, producing (x, y, z). Conversely, given any triplet (x, y, z), we first locate point L at (x, 0, 0) on the x-axis, then point M at (x, y, 0) on the XY-plane, and finally, from M, move a distance z along the z-direction to reach P. Since these constructions are unique and reversible, a one-to-one correspondence exists.",
    "explanation": "The proof involves constructing a point from a triplet and demonstrating that the process is unique. Similarly, starting from any point, projecting to the coordinate planes yields unique coordinates.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The y-coordinate and z-coordinate are both 0. In other words, any point on the x-axis can be represented as (x, 0, 0) where x is a real number.",
    "explanation": "A point on the x-axis lies entirely along that axis, meaning there is no displacement in the y- or z-directions. Therefore, by definition, the y-coordinate and z-coordinate must both be 0, leaving only the x-coordinate as non-zero.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The y-coordinate is 0. Every point in the XZ-plane is of the form (x, 0, z).",
    "explanation": "The XZ-plane is defined by the x-axis and z-axis. This means that for any point lying in this plane, there is no displacement along the y-axis. Hence, the y-coordinate must be 0.",

    "explanation": "Determine the signs for each coordinate of the points and match them with the standard sign conventions for octants. In 3D space, Octant I has all positive coordinates. For example, (1, 2, 3) has x > 0, y > 0, z > 0 so it is in Octant I. For (4, –2, 3), x is positive, y is negative, and z is positive which corresponds to Octant IV. Continuing in this manner by comparing the signs with the provided table, the octants are determined as specified.",

    "correct_answer": "(i) XY-plane; (ii) (x, y, 0); (iii) eight.",
    "explanation": "Explanation: (i) The x-axis and y-axis, when taken together, form the XY-plane because every point in this plane can be described by its x and y values. (ii) In the XY-plane, since there is no height component out of the plane, the z-coordinate for every point is 0, so the coordinates are in the form (x, y, 0). (iii) The three mutually perpendicular coordinate planes divide the three-dimensional space into eight distinct regions known as octants.",
