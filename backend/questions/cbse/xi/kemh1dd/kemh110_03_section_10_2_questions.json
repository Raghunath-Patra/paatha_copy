    "explanation": "Consider a cone with vertex V, vertical axis l, and generator m at an angle α. If a plane intersects the cone making an angle β (with α < β < 90°), it slices through one nappe obliquely. In a cross-sectional view, the intersection appears as a stretched circle because the cut is not perpendicular to the axis. This distortion results in an ellipse.

    "explanation": "Start with x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Group as (x² + Dx) + (y² + Ey) = -F. For the x terms, add and subtract (D/2)², and for the y terms add and subtract (E/2)². This gives: (x² + Dx + (D/2)²) + (y² + Ey + (E/2)²) = -F + (D/2)² + (E/2)². The groups become perfect squares: (x + D/2)² and (y + E/2)².

    "explanation": "Consider a vertical cone with vertex V, axis l, and generator m at an angle α. If the plane is horizontal (β = 90°), the cross-section is a circle. As β decreases (with α < β < 90°), the intersection becomes an ellipse since the plane cuts obliquely through one nappe. When β equals α, the plane is parallel to a generator, resulting in a parabola. If β is less than α, the plane cuts both nappes and the intersection is a hyperbola (or two intersecting lines in the degenerate case when the plane passes through the vertex).
