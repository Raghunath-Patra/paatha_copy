    "explanation": "A well-defined set has a clear criterion to decide whether an element belongs or not. The set of odd natural numbers less than 10 (i.e. {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}) is well-defined because any natural number can clearly be checked for being odd and less than 10.

    "correct_answer": "Proof: Let the set of odd natural numbers be O = {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. By definition of a set, membership is determined solely by whether an element satisfies the property of being odd. Therefore, any arrangement of these elements (such as {3, 1, 7, 5, ...}) still includes exactly the same elements. Since the definition of equality for sets is that two sets are equal if they have precisely the same elements regardless of order, the reordering of elements in O does not change the set. Q.E.D.",
    "explanation": "The vital concept here is that in set theory the order of elements is irrelevant. The defining property of the set is that each element is odd. Reordering does not introduce or remove any element. Thus, regardless of how the elements are arranged, the set remains the same.",

This condition includes exactly those numbers which are divisors of 42, thereby ensuring that every and only those numbers appear in the set.",
    "explanation": "To convert from roster form to set-builder form, we identify the common property among the elements. Here, each element is a positive divisor of 42.
