    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to its variable, essentially describing how the function behaves as its input varies. Historically, Sir Isaac Newton, alongside Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, developed the fundamental ideas of calculus, which provided a powerful framework to understand motion and change. Newton applied these concepts extensively in physics, particularly in his study of gravitational forces, motion, and optics. By interpreting derivatives as slopes of tangent lines to curves, early mathematicians established tools to model natural phenomena. This connection between change and derivative paved the way for more systematic approaches in both pure and applied mathematics.",

Expand (x + h)ⁿ using the binomial theorem: (x + h)ⁿ = xⁿ + n x^(n-1)h + terms involving higher powers of h. Hence, (x + h)ⁿ - xⁿ = n x^(n-1)h + O(h²). Dividing by h gives: n x^(n-1) + terms that vanish as h approaches 0; therefore, f'(x) = n x^(n-1).",
