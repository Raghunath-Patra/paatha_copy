    "correct_answer": "For (i), since each first element is distinct, it is a function. Domain = {2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17} and Range = {1}. For (ii), all ordered pairs have different first components, so it is a function with Domain = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14} and Range = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. For (iii), the element 1 is associated with two different images (3 and 5), so it is not a function.",
    "explanation": "Examine each set of ordered pairs. A relation is a function if every element in the domain (the set of first coordinates) is associated with exactly one element in the codomain. In (i) and (ii) each first component appears only once, ensuring a unique output; however, in (iii) the first element 1 appears twice with different outputs, violating the definition of a function.",

    "explanation": "For (i), the function f(x) = -x² is defined for every real number x; since x² is always non-negative, -x² is always non-positive, so the maximum value is 0 (attained when x = 0) and the outputs extend downward to –∞. For (ii), the square root requires the radicand to be non-negative: 9 − x² ≥ 0, which implies −3 ≤ x ≤ 3. The square root gives non-negative outputs; the maximum occurs when 9 - x² is largest, which is 9 (when x = 0), so the maximum value is 3, giving the range [0, 3].",
