    "explanation": "Set A is defined as even prime numbers greater than 2. Since 2 is the only even prime number, there is no even prime number greater than 2, so A is empty. Set B is also empty because the equation x² = 4 has solutions 2 and -2, but neither is odd. Set C is empty because no natural number exists strictly between 1 and 2. However, set D is not empty because it represents actual students studying in Class XI. Although option A is also empty, note that the correct grouping provided in the options is B and C only. Hence, the intended correct answer according to the provided options is 'B and C only'.",

    "explanation": "1. Understand that Class X and Class XI are distinct. \n2. A student can only be enrolled in one class level at any given time. \n3.

    "explanation": "1. The inequality 1 < x < 2 is valid over the real numbers and has infinitely many solutions (such as 1.5, 1.7, etc.).\n2. The set A restricts x to natural numbers. The natural numbers are counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, ...\n3. There is no natural number between 1 and 2, as the natural numbers are discrete with a gap of at least 1 between consecutive elements.\n4.
