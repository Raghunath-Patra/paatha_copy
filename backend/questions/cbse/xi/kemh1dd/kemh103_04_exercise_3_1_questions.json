    "explanation": "To convert degrees to radians, use the conversion factor: Radian = (π/180) × (degree measure). \n(i) 25°: 25 × (π/180) = 25π/180 which simplifies to 5π/36. \n(ii) –47°30′: First convert 47°30′ to a decimal degree: 47 + 30/60 = 47.5°. Then, –47.5 × (π/180) = –47.5π/180 = –19π/72 after simplification. \n(iii) 240°: 240 × (π/180) = 4π/3. \n(iv) 520°: 520 × (π/180) = 520π/180 which simplifies to 26π/9.",

    "explanation": "To convert from radians to degrees, use the conversion: Degree = (180/π) × (radian measure), with π approximated by 22/7 when needed. \n(i) For 11/16 radians: (11/16) × (180 ÷ (22/7)) = (11/16) × (180×7/22) = (11×180×7)/(16×22). Simplify 11/22 to 1/2; then you get (180×7)/(32) = 1260/32 = 315/8, which is approximately 39.38°. \n(ii) For -4 radians: -4 × (180×7/22) = - (4×1260/22) = -5040/22 = -2520/11, approximately -229.09°. \n(iii) For 5π/3 radians: (5π/3) × (180/π) = 5×180/3 = 300°. \n(iv) For 7π/6 radians: (7π/6) × (180/π) = 7×180/6 = 210°.",

    "explanation": "First, note that the circle’s diameter is 40 cm so the radius r = 20 cm. For a chord of length c = 20 cm, the relationship between chord length and the subtended central angle θ is given by c = 2r sin(θ/2). \nThus, 20 = 2×20 sin(θ/2) ⇒ sin(θ/2) = 20/(40) = 0.5. \nThis implies θ/2 = 30° (or π/6 radians), so θ = 60° which is equal to π/3 radians. \nThe length of the arc is then given by l = r × θ = 20 × (π/3) = 20π/3 cm.",

    "correct_answer": "The ratio of the radii is 5:4.",
    "explanation": "Let the arcs of equal length be l. For the first circle with radius r₁ and angle 60° (which is π/3 radians), l = r₁(π/3). For the second circle with radius r₂ and angle 75° (which is 75×π/180 = 5π/12 radians), l = r₂(5π/12). Setting these equal gives r₁(π/3) = r₂(5π/12). Cancel π and solve for the ratio: r₁/r₂ = (5/12) ÷ (1/3) = (5/12) × (3/1) = 5/4. Thus, the ratio of radii is 5:4.",
