    "correct_answer": "To determine the coordinates of point P, first drop a perpendicular from P to the XY-plane, meeting it at point M. The x and y coordinates of P are then the same as the coordinates of M. Next, from M, determine the distance to P along the perpendicular direction (z-axis) to assign the z-coordinate. Alternatively, one can draw three planes through P parallel to the coordinate planes, and the distances along the coordinate axes to these intersection points are x, y, and z respectively.",
    "explanation": "The process works by projecting P onto the planes: the XY-plane gives (x, y, 0) for its projection, while the vertical distance from the XY-plane to P gives z. This ensures a one-to-one correspondence between the point in space and its coordinate triplet.",

    "correct_answer": "To prove the one-to-one correspondence, we show that every point P in space can be uniquely identified by an ordered triplet (x, y, z) and vice versa. First, given any point P, we can drop a perpendicular to the XY-plane at M, so that M has coordinates (x, y, 0). Then the distance from M to P along the z-axis gives the coordinate z, producing (x, y, z). Conversely, given any triplet (x, y, z), we first locate point L at (x, 0, 0) on the x-axis, then point M at (x, y, 0) on the XY-plane, and finally, from M, move a distance z along the z-direction to reach P. Since these constructions are unique and reversible, a one-to-one correspondence exists.",
    "explanation": "The proof involves constructing a point from a triplet and demonstrating that the process is unique. Similarly, starting from any point, projecting to the coordinate planes yields unique coordinates. Thus, every point corresponds exactly to one ordered triplet (x, y, z), and every triplet corresponds to one point in space.",

    "correct_answer": "Through the point P, draw a plane parallel to the YZ-plane which will intersect the x-axis at a point A such that OA = x.

Finally, draw a plane through P parallel to the XY-plane, which intersects the z-axis at a point C such that OC = z. The intersection of these three planes is the point P and the distances OA, OB, and OC provide the coordinates (x, y, z).",
    "explanation": "This derivation emphasizes that the construction of planes parallel to the coordinate planes isolates each coordinate.
