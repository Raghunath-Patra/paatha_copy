    "correct_answer": "Combinatorial techniques allow us to compute the total number of arrangements or selections without needing to list every possibility. In the suitcase number lock, with the first digit fixed and no repetition allowed, we use permutations (9P3 = 504) to quickly determine that there are 504 possible sequences. Such methods make it unnecessary to manually enumerate each sequence and can be applied to tasks like scheduling, routing, or cryptography.",
    "explanation": "By applying the fundamental counting principle and permutation formulas, complex counting problems become simple multiplications. For the suitcase lock, each successive wheel (after the fixed digit) offers fewer choices due to the no-repetition rule, leading to the calculation: 9 × 8 × 7 = 504. This approach highlights the efficiency of combinatorial methods in real-world scenarios by drastically reducing computational effort.",
