    "explanation": "Total marbles = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60. (i) To have all 5 drawn marbles blue, choose 5 from 20 blue marbles: number of favorable outcomes = C(20,5). Total ways to draw 5 from 60 = C(60,5). Therefore, P(all blue) = C(20,5)/C(60,5). (ii) 'At least one green' means the complement of drawing no green marbles. Non-green marbles are red and blue: 10 + 20 = 30. Hence, number of ways to choose 5 non-green = C(30,5). The probability that none is green = C(30,5)/C(60,5). Therefore, P(at least one green) = 1 - C(30,5)/C(60,5).",

    "explanation": "First, note that for a 4-digit number greater than 5000 using {0,1,3,5,7}, the thousand's digit must be 5 or 7. (i) With repetition allowed, total numbers = 2 (choices for thousand's digit) × 5 × 5 × 5 = 250. A number divisible by 5 must end in 0 or 5. For last digit = 0: favorable = 2 × 5 × 5 = 50; for last digit = 5: favorable = 2 × 5 × 5 = 50. Total favorable = 50 + 50 = 100, so probability = 100/250 = 0.4. (ii) Without repetition: Total ways = 2 × P(4-1 from remaining 4) = 2 × (4×3×2) = 48. Favorable cases: Case 1, last digit = 0. Then thousand's digit (2 choices from {5,7}) and for middle two digits, choose and arrange 2 out of remaining 3 digits (P(3,2)=6), count = 2×6 = 12. Case 2, last digit = 5. Then thousand's digit cannot be 5; only choice is 7 (1 possibility) and middle two digits from remaining 3 digits (again 6 ways), count = 1×6 = 6.
