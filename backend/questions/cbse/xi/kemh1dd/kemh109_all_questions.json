Eliminating α and β between these equations leads, after algebraic manipulation, to the condition m₁(c₂ – c₃) + m₂(c₃ – c₁) + m₃(c₁ – c₂) = 0.

If a line through (3, 2) makes an angle of 45° with this line, and if its slope is m, then using the formula for the angle between two lines, |(m – m₁)/(1 + m·m₁)| = tan45° = 1. This yields two equations: (m – 1/2)/(1 + m/2) = 1 or (m – 1/2)/(1 + m/2) = –1. Solving the first case: m – 1/2 = 1 + m/2 ⟹ (m – m/2) = 1 + 1/2 ⟹ m/2 = 3/2, so m = 3.

    "correct_answer": "Since the foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the line y = mx + c is (–1, 2), two conditions hold. First, (–1, 2) lies on the line, so 2 = m(–1) + c, which gives c = 2 + m. Second, the line joining the origin (0, 0) to (–1, 2) has slope 2/–1 = –2. Since this line is perpendicular to y = mx + c, whose slope is m, we must have m × (–2) = –1, so m = 1/2. Then c = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2.",

    "correct_answer": "For the first line, the distance from the origin is given by |0 − k cos2θ|/√(cos²θ + sin²θ) = |k cos2θ|. Hence, p = k|cos2θ|. For the second line, write it in the standard form. Its distance from the origin is |k|/√(sec²θ + cosec²θ). Since sec²θ + cosec²θ = 1/cos²θ + 1/sin²θ = (sin²θ + cos²θ)/(sin²θ cos²θ) = 1/(sin²θ cos²θ), we have √(sec²θ + cosec²θ) = 1/(|sinθ cosθ|) = 2/|sin2θ|. Thus, q = |k|/(2/|sin2θ|) = k|sin2θ|/2. Then, p² + 4q² = k² cos²2θ + 4(k² sin²2θ/4) = k²(cos²2θ + sin²2θ) = k², proving the stated result.",
    "explanation": "• For the line x cosθ − y sinθ = k cos2θ, the perpendicular distance from (0, 0) is |−k cos2θ| divided by √(cos²θ + sin²θ) which equals k|cos2θ|, so p = k|cos2θ|.\n• For the second line, x secθ + y cosecθ = k, rewrite the coefficients so that the distance formula applies. The normalizing factor is √(sec²θ + cosec²θ). Recognize that sec²θ + cosec²θ = 1/cos²θ + 1/sin²θ = 1/(sin²θ cos²θ) = 4/sin²2θ, hence the denominator becomes 2/|sin2θ|. Thus, q = k|sin2θ|/2.\n• Squaring, p² = k² cos²2θ and 4q² = 4*(k² sin²2θ/4) = k² sin²2θ. Adding gives k²(cos²2θ + sin²2θ) = k², since cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.\n• This completes the proof.",

Using point-slope form, the altitude is: y − 3 = 1(x − 2), or y = x + 1. The length of the altitude is the distance from A (2, 3) to the line BC: distance = |(1)(2) + (1)(3) − 3|/√(1² + 1²) = |2 + 3 − 3|/√2 = 2/√2 = √2.",

    "explanation": "Step 1: The angle 2π/3 (or 120°) gives a slope m = tan(120°) = -√3.
