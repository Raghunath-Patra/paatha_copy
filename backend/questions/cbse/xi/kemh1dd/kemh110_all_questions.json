By squaring both sides and simplifying step-by-step (with careful handling of the radical terms), one can derive the standard form of the ellipse equation. While the algebra is tedious, every step maintains the constant sum property proving the definition.",
    "explanation": "1. Start with PF1 + PF2 = 2a where F1 = (−c, 0) and F2 = (c, 0).\n2. Write in distance form: √[(x + c)² + y²] + √[(x − c)² + y²] = 2a.\n3. Isolate one square root and square both sides to eliminate the radical.\n4. Simplify and repeat the process to remove the second radical.\n5. Finally, after simplifying, the derived equation is (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, with b² = a² - c².\nThis detailed derivation confirms the ellipse definition through algebraic manipulation.",

    "correct_answer": "Depending on the angle at which the plane intersects the double-napped cone, different curves are obtained: \n- If the plane is perpendicular to the axis of the cone, the intersection is a circle.\n- If the plane cuts through one nappe of the cone at an angle but does not pass through the vertex, the intersection is an ellipse.\n- If the plane is parallel to a generating line of the cone, the intersection is a parabola.\n- If the plane cuts through both nappes of the cone, the intersection is a hyperbola.",
    "explanation": "1. For a circle, the plane must cut the cone perpendicular to its axis, giving all points equidistant from the center.\n2. For an ellipse, the plane intersects one nappe at an oblique angle. The resulting figure retains the property that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to two fixed points is constant.\n3. For a parabola, the plane is parallel to a generatrix of the cone. This ensures that the distance from any point on the curve to the focus is equal to the distance to the directrix.\n4. For a hyperbola, when the plane cuts through both nappes of the cone, two separate curves emerge, which are mirror images of each other.\nThese conditions explain how varying the angle of intersection produces the different conic sections.",
