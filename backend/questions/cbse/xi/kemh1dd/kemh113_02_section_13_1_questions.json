    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Measures of central tendency, such as mean and median, provide a summary of the central or typical value of a dataset; however, they do not capture the spread or variability of the data. For instance, in the batsmen example, both players had a mean and median of 53, but their performances differed significantly. Batsman A had scores ranging from 0 to 117, indicating high variability, whereas Batsman B’s scores were clustered closely between 46 and 60, reflecting low variability. This variability is crucial as it affects interpretation: a high spread may imply inconsistency, while a low spread suggests consistent performance.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains that while the mean and median summarize where the data points are centered, they do not reveal how the data are distributed around that center.
