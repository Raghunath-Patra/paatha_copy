Then s(2+h) - s(2) = (19.6 + 19.6h + 4.9h² - 19.6) = 19.6h + 4.9h². Dividing by h gives 19.6 + 4.9h. Taking the limit as h → 0 results in 19.6 m/s.",

In a diagram, one would show the curve s = 4.9t², mark the point A at t = 2, and select points B for different values of h. The slopes of secant lines AB computed as [s(2+h)-s(2)]/h converge to the slope of the tangent line at A, demonstrating that the instantaneous velocity is the limit of the average velocities over smaller intervals.",
    "explanation": "The diagram should include the curve of s = 4.9t² and illustrate various secant lines from point A (at t = 2) to points B corresponding to t = 2+h. As h approaches zero, these secant lines approach the tangent line at A.
