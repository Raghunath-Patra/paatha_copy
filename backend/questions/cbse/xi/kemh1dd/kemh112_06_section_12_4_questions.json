This gives the inequality sin x < x < tan x.",

    "correct_answer": "Proof: Consider the unit circle with center O. For an angle x (with 0 < x < π/2), draw the radius OA, and let B be the point on the circle such that AB is perpendicular to OA. Also draw the tangent at A meeting the extended line from O making the angle x with OA. Then, by comparing the areas of triangle OAB, sector OAB, and triangle OAC (with C on the tangent), one can show that sin x < x < tan x. Dividing the inequality sin x < x < tan x by sin x (which is positive) produces 1 < x/sin x < 1/cos x. Taking reciprocals (and noting that the inequality reverses when taking reciprocals of positive numbers) results in cos x < (sin x)/x < 1. This completes the proof.",
    "explanation": "The proof uses a geometric construction in a unit circle where areas of a triangle, a circular sector, and another triangle are compared.

Also, limₓ→0 sin(x/2)/(x/2) = 1. Thus, limₓ→0 (1 − cos x)/x = 2 × 1² × (1/2) = 1, but note the correct form must consider that as x→0, sin(x/2)→0. In fact, one can also reframe the identity as: (1 − cos x)/x = [1 − cos x]/[x] = (1 − cos x)/(sin x) · (sin x)/x. Since limₓ→0 (sin x)/x = 1 and limₓ→0 (1 − cos x)/(sin x) = 0 (using l’Hôpital's Rule or small angle approximations), the limit is 0.",
    "explanation": "Using the identity 1 − cos x = 2 sin²(x/2) allows splitting the expression into factors whose limits are known. Recognizing that sin(x/2)/(x/2) tends to 1 and that there remains a factor that tends to 0 helps us conclude that the limit is 0.",
