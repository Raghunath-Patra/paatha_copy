Since sec²θ + cosec²θ = 1/cos²θ + 1/sin²θ = (sin²θ + cos²θ)/(sin²θ cos²θ) = 1/(sin²θ cos²θ), we have √(sec²θ + cosec²θ) = 1/(|sinθ cosθ|) = 2/|sin2θ|. Thus, q = |k|/(2/|sin2θ|) = k|sin2θ|/2. Then, p² + 4q² = k² cos²2θ + 4(k² sin²2θ/4) = k²(cos²2θ + sin²2θ) = k², proving the stated result.",
    "explanation": "• For the line x cosθ − y sinθ = k cos2θ, the perpendicular distance from (0, 0) is |−k cos2θ| divided by √(cos²θ + sin²θ) which equals k|cos2θ|, so p = k|cos2θ|.\n• For the second line, x secθ + y cosecθ = k, rewrite the coefficients so that the distance formula applies. The normalizing factor is √(sec²θ + cosec²θ). Recognize that sec²θ + cosec²θ = 1/cos²θ + 1/sin²θ = 1/(sin²θ cos²θ) = 4/sin²2θ, hence the denominator becomes 2/|sin2θ|. Thus, q = k|sin2θ|/2.\n• Squaring, p² = k² cos²2θ and 4q² = 4*(k² sin²2θ/4) = k² sin²2θ. Adding gives k²(cos²2θ + sin²2θ) = k², since cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.\n• This completes the proof.",

    "correct_answer": "First, find the equation of the side BC. The slope of BC, through B (4, –1) and C (1, 2), is m = (2 – (–1))/(1 – 4) = 3/(–3) = −1. The line BC can be written as: using point B, y + 1 = −1(x − 4), i.e., y = −x + 3. The altitude from A (2, 3) is perpendicular to BC so its slope is the negative reciprocal of −1, which is 1. Using point-slope form, the altitude is: y − 3 = 1(x − 2), or y = x + 1. The length of the altitude is the distance from A (2, 3) to the line BC: distance = |(1)(2) + (1)(3) − 3|/√(1² + 1²) = |2 + 3 − 3|/√2 = 2/√2 = √2.",

Its equation, using point B, is y + 1 = −1(x − 4) ⇒ y = −x + 3.\n• The altitude from A must be perpendicular to BC. The slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope −1 is 1.\n• The equation of the altitude through A (2, 3) is then y − 3 = 1(x − 2), hence y = x + 1.\n• To get the length, use the distance from point A to the line BC. Writing BC as x + y − 3 = 0, the distance is |2 + 3 − 3|/√(1²+1²) = 2/√2 = √2.",
