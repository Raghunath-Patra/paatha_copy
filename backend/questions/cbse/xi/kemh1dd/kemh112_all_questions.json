Historically, Sir Isaac Newton, alongside Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, developed the fundamental ideas of calculus, which provided a powerful framework to understand motion and change. Newton applied these concepts extensively in physics, particularly in his study of gravitational forces, motion, and optics. By interpreting derivatives as slopes of tangent lines to curves, early mathematicians established tools to model natural phenomena. This connection between change and derivative paved the way for more systematic approaches in both pure and applied mathematics.",

    "correct_answer": "In the unit circle, for an angle x (in radians) between 0 and π/2, the length of the arc corresponding to angle x is x. The sine of x is the y-coordinate of a point on the circle and represents the length of the perpendicular from the point to the x-axis, which is less than the arc length. Conversely, the tangent of x, which is the length of the line segment from the point where the extension of the terminal side meets the tangent line at (1, 0), is greater than x. This gives the inequality sin x < x < tan x.",
    "explanation": "A unit circle is drawn where the central angle x produces an arc of length x. The vertical line (representing sin x) is shorter than the curved arc, while the tangent line, extending further from the circle, is longer than the arc.

    "correct_answer": "Proof: Consider the unit circle with center O. For an angle x (with 0 < x < π/2), draw the radius OA, and let B be the point on the circle such that AB is perpendicular to OA. Also draw the tangent at A meeting the extended line from O making the angle x with OA. Then, by comparing the areas of triangle OAB, sector OAB, and triangle OAC (with C on the tangent), one can show that sin x < x < tan x. Dividing the inequality sin x < x < tan x by sin x (which is positive) produces 1 < x/sin x < 1/cos x. Taking reciprocals (and noting that the inequality reverses when taking reciprocals of positive numbers) results in cos x < (sin x)/x < 1. This completes the proof.",
