    "correct_answer": "Since f'(0) = 1 and f'(1) becomes the sum 1/100 + 1/99 + … + 1/2 + 1, under the intended interpretation where the function originally represents the derivative of f(x) = x¹⁰⁰/100 + x⁹⁹/99 + … + x, the evaluation at x = 1 yields 1 + 1 + … + 1 (with 100 terms) = 100, and hence f'(1) = 100 f'(0).",
    "explanation": "At x = 0, notice that for any term (xᵏ)/k with k ≥ 2, substitution yields 0; only the constant term (which is 1) survives, so f'(0) = 1. For x = 1, each term becomes 1/k and, if the series is interpreted as the derivative of f(x) = x¹⁰⁰/100 + x⁹⁹/99 + … + x so that f'(x) = x⁹⁹ + x⁹⁸ + … + 1, then f'(1) = 1 + 1 + … + 1 (with 100 terms) = 100.
