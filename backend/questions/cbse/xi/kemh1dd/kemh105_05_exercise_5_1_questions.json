Adding 25x to both sides: 34x - 18 ≤ 50. Then add 18: 34x ≤ 68, so x ≤ 2. However, note that when multiplying by expressions that might change sign one must be careful. Rechecking the steps: Actually, the original inequality (3(x-2))/5 ≤ (5(2-x))/3 can be rewritten recognizing that 2-x = -(x-2); thus, it becomes (3(x-2))/5 ≤ ( -5(x-2))/3. If x-2 > 0 then dividing by (x-2) (which is positive) gives 3/5 ≤ -5/3, which is false; if x-2 < 0 then dividing by (x-2) reverses inequality yielding 3/5 ≥ -5/3, which is always true.

Multiply both sides by 30: 3(3x + 20) ≥ 10(x - 6) gives 9x + 60 ≥ 10x - 60, so 120 ≥ x, or x ≤ 120. This answer (x ≤ 120) differs from the stated correct answer x ≥ 3 in some published solutions.

    "question_text": "A man wants to cut three lengths from a board of length 91 cm. The second length is 3 cm longer than the shortest and the third is twice as long as the shortest. Also, the third piece must be at least 5 cm longer than the second. What are the possible lengths for the shortest piece?",
    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "If x is the shortest, then 8 ≤ x ≤ 22.",
    "explanation": "Let the shortest length be x. Then the pieces are: x, (x + 3), and 2x. The total length constraint is x + (x+3) + 2x ≤ 91, i.e., 4x + 3 ≤ 91, which gives x ≤ 22. The third piece must be at least 5 cm longer than the second: 2x ≥ (x+3) + 5, so 2x ≥ x + 8, i.e., x ≥ 8. Thus, x is between 8 and 22 (inclusive of the bounds if equality holds where permitted).",
