Mean deviation is simpler to compute and understand but does not reflect the impact of outliers as strongly. Standard deviation, by squaring the differences, gives more weight to larger deviations and is more sensitive to outliers, making it a more robust measure for many statistical analyses. However, this sensitivity can sometimes exaggerate the presence of extreme values.",
    "explanation": "Both measures assess the dispersion of data around the mean, yet they do so differently. Mean deviation uses absolute values so that all deviations contribute equally, while standard deviation squares the differences, thereby magnifying the influence of outliers. This makes the standard deviation more appropriate for normally distributed data where large deviations are significant, though it can be misleading if the data contains extreme anomalies. Mean deviation is less affected by extreme values, making it useful in certain contexts, but it is not as widely used in inferential statistics due to its mathematical properties.",

With mean μ = 9, calculate squared deviations for the given six observations:\n (6−9)² = 9, (7−9)² = 4, (10−9)² = 1, (12−9)² = 9, (12−9)² = 9, (13−9)² = 16; Sum = 9 + 4 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 16 = 48.\nStep 5: Thus, the sum of squared deviations for the remaining two observations is 74 − 48 = 26. That is, (x − 9)² + (y − 9)² = 26.\nStep 6: Since x + y = 12, set y = 12 − x. Substitute into the squared deviations:\n (x − 9)² + ((12 − x) − 9)² = (x − 9)² + (3 − x)² = 26.\nStep 7: Expanding gives: (x² − 18x + 81) + (x² − 6x + 9) = 2x² − 24x + 90 = 26.\nStep 8: Simplify: 2x² − 24x + 64 = 0 ⇒ x² − 12x + 32 = 0.\nStep 9: Factor or use the quadratic formula: (x − 4)(x − 8) = 0, so x = 4 or x = 8.
