    "explanation": "Write the given line in the form: (k – 3)x + (4k²)y + (k² – 7k + 6) = 0. (a) For a line to be parallel to the x-axis its slope must be zero. In the slope-intercept form y = mx + c the slope m = –[(k–3)/(4k²)]. Setting m = 0 forces the numerator to vanish, so k – 3 = 0, hence k = 3. (b) For the line to be vertical (parallel to the y-axis), the slope must be undefined; that occurs when the coefficient of y is zero (and the coefficient of x is nonzero). Thus, set 4k² = 0 which gives k = 0. (c) For the line to pass through the origin, the constant term must be zero, so solve k² – 7k + 6 = 0. Factoring gives (k – 1)(k – 6) = 0, hence k = 1 or k = 6.",

    "explanation": "First, note that the two given lines are parallel. Write them in comparable form. Divide the first equation by 3 to obtain 3x + 2y – 7/3 = 0. The second is already 3x + 2y + 6 = 0. The line equidistant from two parallel lines has the same normal vector and its constant term is the average of the constant terms of the normalized equations. Thus, the mid-line is 3x + 2y + ((–7/3 + 6)/2) = 0. Simplify: –7/3 + 6 = (–7 + 18)/3 = 11/3, and half of that is 11/6 so the equation is 3x + 2y + 11/6 = 0. Multiplying through by 6 gives 18x + 12y + 11 = 0.",

    "explanation": "Since the reflection occurs on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of A is 0. To find A, reflect the initial point (1, 2) about the x-axis to get (1, –2). The straight line joining (1, –2) and (5, 3) gives the path of the reflected ray. The slope of this line is (3 – (–2))/(5 – 1) = 5/4, and its equation using point-slope form (with point (1, –2)) is y + 2 = (5/4)(x – 1). Setting y = 0 (since A is on the x-axis) gives 2 = (5/4)(x – 1) ⟹ x – 1 = 8/5 ⟹ x = 13/5.",

    "explanation": "For a point (x₁, y₁), the perpendicular distance to the line (x/a)cosθ + (y/b)sinθ = 1 (which can be rewritten as x cosθ/a + y sinθ/b – 1 = 0) is given by D = |(x₁ cosθ/a + y₁ sinθ/b – 1)|/√[(cos²θ/a²) + (sin²θ/b²)]. Substituting x₁ = √(a² – b²), y₁ = 0 in one case and x₁ = –√(a² – b²), y₁ = 0 in the other and simplifying each distance separately, one finds that when multiplied the terms combine (using identities such as cos²θ + sin²θ = 1) to yield b².",

    "explanation": "First, determine the junction point by solving 2x – 3y + 4 = 0 and 3x + 4y – 5 = 0 simultaneously. Using elimination, one obtains the junction point as (–1/17, 22/17). The path for the least time is the straight line drawn perpendicular to the target path 6x – 7y + 8 = 0. The given line has slope from 6x – 7y + 8 = 0 ⟹ y = (6/7)x + (8/7), so its slope is 6/7, and hence the perpendicular slope is –7/6.
