    "correct_answer": "The total number of outcomes when three independent events occur in succession is m × n × p.

Then, for each of these m × n outcomes, there are p outcomes for the third event. Thus, the combined total is m × n × p.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Identify the number of outcomes for each event: Event 1 has m outcomes, Event 2 has n outcomes, and Event 3 has p outcomes.\nStep 2: Apply the multiplication principle: After selecting one outcome from the first event, the second event offers n choices, which gives m × n possibilities for the first two events combined.\nStep 3: For each of these m × n combinations, the third event provides p possibilities. Therefore, total outcomes = m × n × p.\nThis derivation is a direct application of the Fundamental Principle of Counting.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Without repetition, the number of arrangements is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. This is because the first letter can be chosen in 4 ways, the second in 3 ways (after removing the first), the third in 2 ways, and the fourth in 1 way. If repetition is allowed, each of the 4 positions can be filled in 4 ways, leading to 4^4 = 256 possible arrangements.",
    "explanation": "Proof without repetition:\n- Position 1: 4 choices\n- Position 2: 3 remaining choices\n- Position 3: 2 remaining choices\n- Position 4: 1 remaining choice\nTotal = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.\nWith repetition allowed:\n- Each position: 4 choices regardless of previous selections\nTotal = 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256.\nThis demonstrates how the restriction of using each letter only once significantly reduces the number of possible arrangements.",
