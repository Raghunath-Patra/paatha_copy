    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(i) 125; (ii) 60",
    "explanation": "For part (i): When repetition is allowed, each of the three places (hundreds, tens and units) can be filled in 5 ways. Total number = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125. For part (ii): When repetition is not allowed, the hundreds place can be filled in 5 ways, the tens place in 4 ways (remaining digits), and the units place in 3 ways, for a total of 5 × 4 × 3 = 60.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "108",
    "explanation": "The units place must be an even digit. The even digits in the set are 2, 4, and 6, giving 3 choices for the units place. Since digits can be repeated, the hundreds and tens places can each be any of the 6 digits. Therefore, the total number of 3-digit even numbers = 6 (hundreds) × 6 (tens) × 3 (units) = 108.",

    "correct_answer": "5040",
    "explanation": "The problem asks for the number of possible arrangements (permutations) of 4 letters chosen from 10 with no repetition. Therefore, the number of codes = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 = 5040.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "336",
    "explanation": "Since every telephone number must start with 67, the first two digits are fixed. That uses up the digits 6 and 7. For the remaining three digits, there are 8 digits left (from the set 0–9 excluding 6 and 7) and no repetition is allowed. Thus, the number of telephone numbers = 8 (for the third digit) × 7 (for the fourth digit) × 6 (for the fifth digit) = 336.",

    "correct_answer": "20",
    "explanation": "A signal is created by arranging 2 flags one below the other. The upper flag can be chosen in 5 ways, and then the lower flag can be chosen in 4 ways (since repetition is not allowed). Thus, the total number of signals = 5 × 4 = 20.",
