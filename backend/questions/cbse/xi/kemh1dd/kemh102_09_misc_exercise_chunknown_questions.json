    "correct_answer": "f is a function because at the junction x = 3 the two pieces agree (since 3² = 9 and 3×3 = 9), so every x in [0,10] has a unique output. In contrast, g is not a function because at x = 2, the definition is ambiguous: one branch gives g(2) = 2² = 4 and the other gives g(2) = 3×2 = 6, so the input 2 would have two distinct outputs.",
    "explanation": "For a relation to be a function, each input must have exactly one output. For f, the piecewise definition covers 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 and 3 ≤ x ≤ 10. At the boundary x = 3, both definitions yield the same value (9), ensuring uniqueness. For g, however, the definitions overlap at x = 2. Since 2 is included in both intervals (0 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 2 ≤ x ≤ 10), it produces two different outputs (4 and 6), violating the definition of a function.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Since f'(x) = x², an antiderivative of x² is f(x) = (1/3)x³ + C. Assuming we use the difference quotient at x = 1, we have f(1+l) - f(1) = [(1/3)(1+l)³ - (1/3)(1)³]. Thus, (f(1+l) - f(1))/(l) = (1/3)[( (1+l)³ - 1)]/l. Expanding (1+l)³ gives 1 + 3l + 3l² + l³. Therefore, the expression simplifies to (1/3)[3l + 3l² + l³]/l = (1/3)[3 + 3l + l²] = 1 + l + (1/3)l². (Note: Due to ambiguous notation in the original question, this interpretation assumes the intended difference quotient is taken at x = 1.)",
    "explanation": "Given f'(x) = x², we integrate to obtain f(x) = (1/3)x³ + constant. The difference quotient (f(1+l) - f(1))/(l) is computed by evaluating f at 1+l and at 1:\n\nf(1+l) = (1/3)(1+l)³; f(1) = (1/3).\nSubtract to obtain: (1/3)[(1+l)³ - 1].\nExpanding (1+l)³ yields 1 + 3l + 3l² + l³. Subtracting 1 gives 3l + 3l² + l³.\nDividing by l simplifies the expression to (1/3)[3 + 3l + l²] = 1 + l + (1/3)l².\nThis is the value of the difference quotient for the assumed interpretation.",
