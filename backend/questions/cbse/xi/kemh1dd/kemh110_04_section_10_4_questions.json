    "correct_answer": "Starting with the definition, for a point P(x, y) on the parabola, the distance to the focus F(a, 0) must equal its distance to the directrix x = -a. \nDistance PF = √[(x - a)² + y²]. \nDistance from P to the directrix = |x + a|. \nSetting these equal: √[(x - a)² + y²] = |x + a|. \nSquaring both sides: (x - a)² + y² = (x + a)². \nExpanding: x² - 2ax + a² + y² = x² + 2ax + a². \nCancelling like terms gives: y² = 4ax. \nThis is the standard equation of the parabola.",
    "explanation": "The derivation begins by applying the distance formula to both the focus and the directrix.

    "correct_answer": "Let the focus be F(a, 0) and the directrix be the line x = -a. Draw a perpendicular from F to the directrix; its foot, say B, will be at (-a, 0). The midpoint M of FB has coordinates ((a + (–a))/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (0, 0), which is the vertex of the parabola. This proves that the vertex is the midpoint between the focus and the directrix (more precisely, the foot of the perpendicular from the focus onto the directrix).",
    "explanation": "Using coordinate geometry, we calculated the midpoint of the segment joining F(a, 0) and B(-a, 0).
