Such methods make it unnecessary to manually enumerate each sequence and can be applied to tasks like scheduling, routing, or cryptography.",
    "explanation": "By applying the fundamental counting principle and permutation formulas, complex counting problems become simple multiplications. For the suitcase lock, each successive wheel (after the fixed digit) offers fewer choices due to the no-repetition rule, leading to the calculation: 9 × 8 × 7 = 504. This approach highlights the efficiency of combinatorial methods in real-world scenarios by drastically reducing computational effort.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The total number of outcomes when three independent events occur in succession is m × n × p. This is derived by noting that for each of the m outcomes of the first event, there are n possible outcomes for the second event, making m × n outcomes for the first two events. Then, for each of these m × n outcomes, there are p outcomes for the third event. Thus, the combined total is m × n × p.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Identify the number of outcomes for each event: Event 1 has m outcomes, Event 2 has n outcomes, and Event 3 has p outcomes.\nStep 2: Apply the multiplication principle: After selecting one outcome from the first event, the second event offers n choices, which gives m × n possibilities for the first two events combined.\nStep 3: For each of these m × n combinations, the third event provides p possibilities. Therefore, total outcomes = m × n × p.\nThis derivation is a direct application of the Fundamental Principle of Counting.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Without repetition, the number of arrangements is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. This is because the first letter can be chosen in 4 ways, the second in 3 ways (after removing the first), the third in 2 ways, and the fourth in 1 way. If repetition is allowed, each of the 4 positions can be filled in 4 ways, leading to 4^4 = 256 possible arrangements.",
    "explanation": "Proof without repetition:\n- Position 1: 4 choices\n- Position 2: 3 remaining choices\n- Position 3: 2 remaining choices\n- Position 4: 1 remaining choice\nTotal = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.\nWith repetition allowed:\n- Each position: 4 choices regardless of previous selections\nTotal = 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256.\nThis demonstrates how the restriction of using each letter only once significantly reduces the number of possible arrangements.",
