This makes the sum of the first n terms: Sₙ = 3 + 3² + … + 3ⁿ = 3(3ⁿ – 1)/(3 – 1) = [3(3ⁿ – 1)]/2. Setting this equal to 120 gives [3(3ⁿ – 1)]/2 = 120, so 3ⁿ – 1 = 80 and hence 3ⁿ = 81.

    "explanation": "Let the three numbers in G.P. be A, B, and C with B² = A·C and A + B + C = 56. After subtracting 1, 7, and 21 respectively, the numbers become A – 1, B – 7, and C – 21. For these to be in arithmetic progression, the middle term must be the average of the other two, so 2(B – 7) = (A – 1) + (C – 21). This simplifies to 2B – 14 = A + C – 22. Since A + B + C = 56, we have A + C = 56 – B. Substituting gives 2B – 14 = 56 – B – 22, so 3B = 48 and B = 16. Then A + C = 40 and A·C = (16)² = 256.
