    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sets form the basic framework for defining relations and functions in mathematics. A relation is defined as a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets, meaning it consists of ordered pairs where the first element comes from one set and the second from another. For example, if A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}, then a relation R could be {(1,2), (2,3)}. A function is a special kind of relation where every element in the domain is paired with exactly one element in the codomain. For instance, the function f: A → B defined by f(1)=2 and f(2)=3 is a well-defined function because each element in A is mapped to one and only one element in B.",
    "explanation": "Sets are essential in forming the basis of relations and functions. A relation is essentially a connection between elements of two sets and is mathematically represented as a subset of the Cartesian product of these sets. A function adheres to a stricter condition where each element in the domain must map to a single element in the codomain. These definitions allow us to formally analyze and understand mathematical mappings and interactions across different fields.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To prove that an ellipse is a conic section, start with its geometric definition: the set of all points (x, y) such that the sum of the distances to two fixed points (foci) F1 = (-c, 0) and F2 = (c, 0) is constant (2a). The distance from a point (x, y) to F1 is √((x + c)² + y²) and to F2 is √((x - c)² + y²). Setting up the equation √((x + c)² + y²) + √((x - c)² + y²) = 2a and then squaring both sides leads to the standard form of the ellipse after some algebraic manipulation. The final equation obtained is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, where b² = a² - c². This derivation shows that the ellipse is indeed a conic section as it can be obtained by slicing a cone at an angle.",
    "explanation": "The proof begins with the geometric definition of the ellipse. By expressing the distances to the foci and using the constant sum property, we square the equation to eliminate the square roots, perform algebraic manipulations, and eventually isolate x and y terms to arrive at x²/a² + y²/b² = 1. This final equation is recognized as the standard form of an ellipse, thus proving that the ellipse is one of the conic sections.",
