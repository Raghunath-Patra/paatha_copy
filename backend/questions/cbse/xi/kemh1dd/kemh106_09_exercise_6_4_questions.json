    "explanation": "We are given that nC8 = nC2. Recall the symmetry property of combinations: nCr = nC(n-r). This equality holds if either 8 = 2 (which is false) or if 8 = n - 2. Solving n - 2 = 8 gives n = 10. Now, nC2 with n = 10 is computed as 10C2 = (10 × 9) / 2 = 45.",

    "explanation": "Let us express the combinations using the formula: nC3 = n(n-1)(n-2)/6 and (2n)C3 = (2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)/6. The ratio simplifies to:\n\nRatio = [(2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)] / [n(n-1)(n-2)]\n\nFor part (i): Set the ratio equal to 12, i.e.,\n\n[(2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)] / [n(n-1)(n-2)] = 12.\n\nCancel a factor of n in numerator and denominator (assuming n > 2) and notice that 2n-2 = 2(n-1), so the expression becomes:\n\n2 × (2n-1) × 2(n-1) / [n(n-1)(n-2)] = [4(2n-1)(n-1)] / [(n-1)(n-2)] = [4(2n-1)] / (n-2).\n\nSetting up the equation:\n\n4(2n-1)/(n-2) = 12\n=> 4(2n-1) = 12(n-2)\n=> 8n - 4 = 12n - 24\n=> 12n - 8n = 24 - 4\n=> 4n = 20, so n = 5.\n\nFor part (ii): Similarly, set the ratio equal to 11:\n\n4(2n-1)/(n-2) = 11\n=> 4(2n-1) = 11(n-2)\n=> 8n - 4 = 11n - 22\n=> 11n - 8n = 22 - 4\n=> 3n = 18, so n = 6.",
