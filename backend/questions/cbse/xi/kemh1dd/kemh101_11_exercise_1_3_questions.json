    "explanation": "For each statement, we verify whether every element of the first set is also an element of the second set. (i) 2, 3, and 4 are all present in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} so the correct symbol is ⊆. (ii) Since 'a' is missing from {b, c, d}, the relation does not hold, thus ⊄ is used. (iii) Every student of Class XI is a student in the school, confirming the subset relation (⊆). (iv) Not all circles in the plane have radius 1 unit, so the relation is ⊄. (v) Triangles and rectangles are different figures, hence the relation is ⊄. (vi) Every equilateral triangle is a triangle, so ⊆ is correct. (vii) Every even natural number is an integer, so the relation is ⊆.",
