In either case, x ∈ A and (x ∈ B or x ∈ C), so x ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C). \nThus, A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C). \nA Venn diagram with three circles clearly shows that the overlapping region of A with (B ∪ C) exactly matches the combined overlapping regions of A with B and A with C.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Assume x is in A ∩ (B ∪ C), meaning it is in A and also in either B or C. This implies x will be found in A ∩ B or A ∩ C, thus in their union. \nStep 2: Conversely, if x is in (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C), then x is in A and in B or C, so x must belong to A ∩ (B ∪ C). \nThe Venn diagram visualizes these regions, confirming the equality.",
