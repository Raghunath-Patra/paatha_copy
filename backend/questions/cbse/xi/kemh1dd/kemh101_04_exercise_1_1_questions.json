(ii) The collection of ten most talented writers of India. (iii) A team of eleven best‐cricket batsmen of the world. (iv) The collection of all boys in your class. (v) The collection of all natural numbers less than 100. (vi) A collection of novels written by the writer Munshi Prem Chand. (vii) The collection of all even integers. (viii) The collection of questions in this Chapter. (ix) A collection of most dangerous animals of the world.",

    "correct_answer": "A mathematical set must be a well-defined collection in which, for each object, there is a definite criterion to decide membership. In the given list: (i) is a set if all months beginning with J (January, June, July) are clearly defined. (ii) and (iii) are not well-defined because criteria (\"ten most talented\" or \"best\") are subjective. (iv) and (v) are sets provided that the class and natural numbers (<100) are clearly specified. (vi) is a set as the novels written by Munshi Prem Chand can be listed. (vii) is a set by virtue of the defining property (even integers). (viii) is a set if the chapter is fixed. (ix) is not well-defined because “most dangerous” is subjective.",
    "explanation": "To determine if a collection qualifies as a mathematical set, we check whether there is a clear and objective property that decides whether any given element should be included. Subjective terms such as 'talented', 'best', or 'most dangerous' lack the necessary precision. For collections like months or natural numbers less than 100, the property is clear and objective. Thus, by analyzing each item one by one, the answer classifies which collections meet the well-defined criterion.",
