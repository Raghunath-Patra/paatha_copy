    "explanation": "We have the relation defined by 3x – y = 0, which can be rearranged as y = 3x. Since both x and y must belong to A = {1, 2, ..., 14}, we choose those x for which 3x is also in A. For x = 1, 3(1) = 3 ∈ A; x = 2 gives 6; x = 3 gives 9; x = 4 gives 12; however, x = 5 gives 15 which is not in A. Thus, the valid pairs are (1,3), (2,6), (3,9), and (4,12). The domain is the set of all x-values used, {1, 2, 3, 4}. The codomain is A by definition, and the range is the set of y-values, {3, 6, 9, 12}.",

    "explanation": "Based on the diagram (Fig2.7) and comparing with a similar example provided earlier, the relation appears to relate an element in P to a number in Q such that the element in P is the square of the element in Q. In set-builder notation, this is expressed as R = {(x, y) : x = y², x ∈ P, y ∈ Q}. For example, if P = {4, 9, 25} and Q includes values whose squares are in P then the roster form might list pairs such as (4,2) and (4,-2) if negatives are allowed; similarly, (9,3) and (9,-3) and (25,5) and (25,-5). The domain, being the set of first elements, is {4, 9, 25} and the range, being the set of second elements present in the pairs, is {–5, –3, –2, 2, 3, 5}.
