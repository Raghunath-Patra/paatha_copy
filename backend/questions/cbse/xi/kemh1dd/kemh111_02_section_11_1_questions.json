Any point in the room is then expressed as (x, y, z), where each coordinate is the perpendicular distance from the point to the corresponding plane.",
    "explanation": "This process involves: 1) Selecting a suitable origin (a corner where two walls and the floor meet), 2) Defining the horizontal axes along the walls, and 3) Establishing the vertical axis perpendicular to the floor.

    "correct_answer": "In a two-dimensional coordinate system, a point is located using two numbers (x and y) corresponding to its position along two perpendicular axes. For instance, a point on a map is defined using latitude and longitude (or x-y coordinates). In contrast, a three-dimensional coordinate system adds a third coordinate (z) to represent height or depth, making it ideal for describing real-life positions such as the location of an object in a room or the trajectory of an airplane in space. While both systems rely on perpendicular axes to define positions, the additional dimension in 3D provides a more comprehensive spatial representation.",
    "explanation": "The answer explains that 2D systems suffice for flat surfaces (like maps), using only two perpendicular axes. However, to capture the vertical dimension—essential for many real-world applications such as in architecture or flight paths—a third axis is introduced, allowing the complete location to be represented as (x, y, z). Detailed analysis of the additional coordinate and its significance in practical scenarios demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinction between the systems.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, any point P can be uniquely specified by the triplet (x, y, z), where each coordinate represents the point's perpendicular distance from the corresponding coordinate plane: |x| is the distance from the yz-plane, |y| from the xz-plane, and |z| from the xy-plane. The proof follows by establishing that for every point in space, these distances are uniquely determined by its projections onto the three coordinate planes. Conversely, given any three non-negative distances (with appropriate signs to indicate direction), one can reconstruct a unique point in space. This bi-directional correspondence between point location and perpendicular distances confirms that three coordinates are both necessary and sufficient to completely describe positions in space.",
    "explanation": "The explanation starts by assigning perpendicular distances to each coordinate plane based on the point's position. By demonstrating that the set of distances (x, y, z) uniquely maps to a point in space and vice versa, the proof relies on the uniqueness of projections and the properties of the Cartesian system. The use of the Pythagorean theorem and basic geometric principles further solidifies the argument.",
