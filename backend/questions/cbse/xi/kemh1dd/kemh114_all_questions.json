Total ways to draw 5 from 60 = C(60,5). Therefore, P(all blue) = C(20,5)/C(60,5). (ii) 'At least one green' means the complement of drawing no green marbles. Non-green marbles are red and blue: 10 + 20 = 30. Hence, number of ways to choose 5 non-green = C(30,5). The probability that none is green = C(30,5)/C(60,5). Therefore, P(at least one green) = 1 - C(30,5)/C(60,5).",

    "question_text": "An experiment involves rolling a pair of dice and recording the numbers that come up. Describe the following events:\nA: the sum is greater than 8,\nB: 2 occurs on either die,\nC: the sum is at least 7 and a multiple of 3.\nWhich pairs of these events are mutually exclusive?",

    "correct_answer": "Define the sample space as all ordered pairs (x, y) with x, y ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n• Event A (sum > 8): all outcomes where x + y ∈ {9, 10, 11, 12}.\n• Event B (2 occurs on either die): outcomes where x = 2 or y = 2.\n• Event C (sum is at least 7 and a multiple of 3): outcomes where x + y ∈ {9, 12} (since 6 is less than 7 and 3 or 6 do not satisfy both conditions simultaneously).\nMutual exclusivity analysis:\n– A and B: For any outcome in B, if one die is 2 the maximum possible sum is 2 + 6 = 8, which does not satisfy A. Hence, A and B are mutually exclusive.\n– B and C: Any outcome in B involves a 2; however, achieving a sum of 9 or 12 with a 2 is impossible because 2 paired with any number ≤6 gives a sum at most 8. Thus, B and C are mutually exclusive.\n– A and C: These events are not mutually exclusive because common outcomes (like (4, 5) for sum 9 or (6, 6) for sum 12) can belong to both A and C.",
    "explanation": "For two dice, every outcome is an ordered pair from 1 to 6 for each die. Using the conditions:\n• Event A selects pairs whose sum is more than 8.\n• Event B selects pairs that have at least one 2. It is impossible for such pairs to reach a sum greater than 8 because the maximum sum with a 2 is 2+6 = 8.\n• Event C is defined by the sum being both at least 7 and a multiple of 3; only the sums 9 and 12 qualify.\nBy examining each pair:\n- A and B cannot coincide because a pair with a 2 cannot have a sum greater than 8.\n- B and C also cannot coincide due to the same reasoning.\n- A and C do have overlapping outcomes (for example, (4, 5) gives a sum of 9 which fits both criteria), so they are not mutually exclusive.",

Compound events contain more than one outcome; thus, B and D are compound events.",
    "explanation": "The sample space for three coin tosses has eight outcomes. Events A and C are clearly simple because each contains only one outcome. Event B consists of all arrangements with exactly two heads and one tail, making it compound. Event D includes outcomes where the first coin is a head; since several outcomes satisfy this criterion, it is a compound event. The events A, B, and C are mutually exclusive because each describes a different exclusive count of heads in a toss, guaranteeing that no outcome is shared between any two of them.",

    "explanation": "Examples are constructed by selecting subsets from the coin toss sample space.
