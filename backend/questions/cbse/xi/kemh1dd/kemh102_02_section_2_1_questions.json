Introduce the function criterion: For every a in domain A, there exists a unique b in codomain B such that (a, b) is in the relation. \n3. Demonstrate that if an element a is paired with more than one b, the rule of uniqueness is violated, thus the relation fails to be a function. \n4. Conversely, if every a is paired with exactly one b, the relation maintains a one-to-one correspondence, confirming its status as a function. \nThis proof shows the necessity and sufficiency conditions for a relation to be a function, ensuring that the mapping between elements is precise.",
