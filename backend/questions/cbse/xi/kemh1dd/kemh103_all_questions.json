    "correct_answer": "Expand the left-hand side: (cos x + cos y)² = cos² x + 2 cos x cos y + cos² y, and (sin x - sin y)² = sin² x - 2 sin x sin y + sin² y. Adding these results gives (cos² x + sin² x) + (cos² y + sin² y) + 2(cos x cos y - sin x sin y) = 1 + 1 + 2 cos(x + y) [since cos x cos y - sin x sin y = cos(x + y)]. This equals 2 + 2 cos(x + y). Using the double-angle identity 2 + 2 cos(x + y) = 4 cos²((x + y)/2) (because cos(x + y) = 2 cos²((x + y)/2) - 1), we get the required result.",
