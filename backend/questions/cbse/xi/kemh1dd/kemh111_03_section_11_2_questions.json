    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Proof: Consider the three coordinate planes: XOY, YOZ, and ZOX. Each plane divides the space into two half-spaces. The XOY plane divides space into regions above (where z > 0) and below (where z < 0). Similarly, the YOZ and ZOX planes divide space based on the signs of x and y respectively. Combining these divisions, a point in space will have a unique sign combination for x, y, and z (each can be either positive or negative). Therefore, there are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 unique combinations, corresponding to the eight octants. Each octant is defined by a distinct combination of signs for (x, y, z), such as (+, +, +) or (–, +, –), etc.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Recognize that each plane provides a binary decision for one coordinate (positive or negative). \nStep 2: Multiply the number of possibilities for each coordinate: 2 options (for x) × 2 options (for y) × 2 options (for z) = 8 octants. \nStep 3: Conclude that there are eight regions in space defined by these sign combinations.",

Then, draw the z-axis perpendicular to the XOY plane (coming out of or going into the page). Label the planes: XOY, YOZ, and ZOX accordingly. To locate a point (x, y, z), start at the origin, move x units along the x-axis, then y units along the y-axis (parallel to the XOY plane), and finally, adjust by z units in the vertical direction (relative to the XOY plane).
