    "explanation": "Step 1: Solve the quadratic in set A: x² – 8x + 12 = 0 factors as (x – 2)(x – 6) = 0, so A = {2, 6}.\nStep 2: Check subsets:\n • A ⊆ B because B = {2, 4, 6} contains both 2 and 6.\n • A ⊆ C because C = {2, 4, 6, 8, …} (the set of even numbers beginning with 2) contains 2 and 6.\n • B ⊆ C because every element of B (which are even numbers 2, 4, 6) appears in C.\n • D = {6} is clearly a subset of A (since 6 ∈ {2,6}), of B, and of C.\nThus the subset relationships are: A ⊆ B ⊆ C and D ⊆ A, D ⊆ B, D ⊆ C.",

    "explanation": "Explanation for each part:\n(i) The statement confuses the element-membership relation (∈) with the subset relation. For example, let A = {1} and B = {{1}}. Here, 1 ∈ A and A ∈ B, but 1 ∉ B since the only element of B is the set {1}.\n(ii) Even if A ⊂ B (i.e. every element of A is in B) and B ∈ C, it does not ensure that A ∈ C because membership of B in C does not transfer to its subsets. For example, take A = {1}, B = {1,2} with A ⊂ B, and let C = {{1,2}, 3}; here, B ∈ C but A is not an element of C.\n(iii) This is true. If every element of A is in B and every element of B is in C, then every element of A is in C, so A ⊂ C.\n(iv) This is false. A counterexample: Let A = {1}, B = {1,2}, and C = {1}. Here, A ⊈ B is false because actually A ⊆ B; to get the intended idea, consider instead A = {2}, B = {1,2} and C = {2,3}. Then A ⊆ B (so A ⊈ B is false) — thus one must choose an example where neither subset relation holds, yet it can happen that A ⊆ C. For instance, let A = {1,4}, B = {1,2}, and C = {1,4,5}. Here, A is not a subset of B and B is not a subset of C, but A ⊆ C. This shows the given statement does not necessarily hold.\n(v) False. For example, let A = {2,3} and B = {2}. Here, 3 ∈ A but A ⊈ B (since 3 ∉ B) and yet 3 ∉ B.\n(vi) True. If A ⊂ B then every element of A is in B. So if x ∉ B, then x could not have been in A.",
