    "correct_answer": "Proof: Let a and b be any real numbers such that a < b. If we add a constant c to both sides, we have a + c and b + c. Since addition of the same number does not change the order, a + c < b + c. Similarly, subtracting a constant yields a - c < b - c. Example: Consider 3 < 5. Adding 2 to both sides gives 5 < 7, which is still true.",
    "explanation": "The order of numbers on the number line is preserved under addition or subtraction because these operations shift all numbers uniformly.
