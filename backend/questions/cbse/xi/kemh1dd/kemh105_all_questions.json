Rechecking the steps: Actually, the original inequality (3(x-2))/5 ≤ (5(2-x))/3 can be rewritten recognizing that 2-x = -(x-2); thus, it becomes (3(x-2))/5 ≤ ( -5(x-2))/3. If x-2 > 0 then dividing by (x-2) (which is positive) gives 3/5 ≤ -5/3, which is false; if x-2 < 0 then dividing by (x-2) reverses inequality yielding 3/5 ≥ -5/3, which is always true.
