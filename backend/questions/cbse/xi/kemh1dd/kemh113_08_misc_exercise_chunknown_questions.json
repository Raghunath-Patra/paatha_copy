    "explanation": "Step 1: Calculate the total sum of all eight observations using the mean: Total = 8 × 9 = 72.\nStep 2: Sum the six given observations: 6 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 12 + 13 = 60.\nStep 3: Therefore, the sum of the remaining two observations must be 72 − 60 = 12, i.e., if the missing values are x and y then x + y = 12.\nStep 4: For the variance (σ² = 9.25), the total sum of squared deviations from the mean is 8 × 9.25 = 74. With mean μ = 9, calculate squared deviations for the given six observations:\n (6−9)² = 9, (7−9)² = 4, (10−9)² = 1, (12−9)² = 9, (12−9)² = 9, (13−9)² = 16; Sum = 9 + 4 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 16 = 48.\nStep 5: Thus, the sum of squared deviations for the remaining two observations is 74 − 48 = 26. That is, (x − 9)² + (y − 9)² = 26.\nStep 6: Since x + y = 12, set y = 12 − x. Substitute into the squared deviations:\n (x − 9)² + ((12 − x) − 9)² = (x − 9)² + (3 − x)² = 26.\nStep 7: Expanding gives: (x² − 18x + 81) + (x² − 6x + 9) = 2x² − 24x + 90 = 26.\nStep 8: Simplify: 2x² − 24x + 64 = 0 ⇒ x² − 12x + 32 = 0.\nStep 9: Factor or use the quadratic formula: (x − 4)(x − 8) = 0, so x = 4 or x = 8. Therefore, the missing observations are 4 and 8.",

With mean μ = 8, calculate squared deviations for the five known observations:\n (2−8)² = 36, (4−8)² = 16, (10−8)² = 4, (12−8)² = 16, (14−8)² = 36; Sum = 36 + 16 + 4 + 16 + 36 = 108.\nStep 5: Therefore, for the remaining two observations, (x − 8)² + (y − 8)² = 112 − 108 = 4.\nStep 6: With x + y = 14 and setting y = 14 − x, substitute into the equation:\n (x − 8)² + ((14 − x) − 8)² = (x − 8)² + (6 − x)² = 4.\nStep 7: Expand: (x² − 16x + 64) + (x² − 12x + 36) = 2x² − 28x + 100 = 4.\nStep 8: Simplify: 2x² − 28x + 96 = 0 ⇒ x² − 14x + 48 = 0.\nStep 9: Solve: Discriminant = 196 − 192 = 4, so x = (14 ± 2) / 2 = 8 or 6.
