    "correct_answer": "The focus is 5 cm from the vertex along the axis of symmetry.",
    "explanation": "For a parabola of the form y = x²/(4p), the sagitta (depth) measured at x = R (half of the diameter) is given by y = R²/(4p). Here, the diameter is 20 cm so the radius R = 10 cm and the given depth (sagitta) is 5 cm. Thus, 10²/(4p) = 5. Simplifying, 100/(4p) = 5, so 4p = 100/5 = 20 and hence p = 5 cm. This distance p from the vertex is the focal length, so the focus is located 5 cm from the vertex along the axis of symmetry.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The width of the arch 2 m from the vertex is approximately 2.24 m.",
    "explanation": "Assume the parabola is given by y = 10 – kx² with the vertex at (0, 10) and the base at y = 0. At the base, y = 0 when x = ±(base/2) = ±2.5 m. Therefore, substituting into the equation: 0 = 10 – k(2.5)², so k(6.25) = 10 and k = 10/6.25 = 1.6. At a point 2 m from the vertex vertically, y = 10 – 2 = 8. Now substitute y = 8: 8 = 10 – 1.6x², so 1.6x² = 2, which implies x² = 1.25 and x ≈ ±1.118 m. The total width is 2 × 1.118 ≈ 2.236 m, which rounds to 2.24 m.",

    "correct_answer": "The length of the supporting wire 18 m from the middle is approximately 9.11 m.",
    "explanation": "Let the vertical distance between the cable and the roadway be given by y = ax² + c, where x is measured from the middle of the roadway. Since the roadway is horizontal, the difference y is the length of the supporting wire. The shortest wire occurs at the middle (x = 0) and is 6 m, so y(0) = c = 6. At the ends of the 100 m roadway, x = ±50 m, the wire length is 30 m: y(50) = a(50)² + 6 = 2500a + 6 = 30. This gives 2500a = 24, so a = 24/2500 = 0.0096. Now, for x = 18 m, y(18) = 0.0096 × (18)² + 6 = 0.0096 × 324 + 6 = 3.1104 + 6 ≈ 9.11 m.",

The ends of the arch are at x = ±4 (where y = 0). A point 1.5 m from one end on the horizontal axis corresponds to x = -4 + 1.5 = -2.5 (taking the left end, without loss of generality). Substitute x = -2.5 into the ellipse equation: (2.5)²/16 + y²/4 = 1 → 6.25/16 + y²/4 = 1 → 0.390625 + y²/4 = 1, so y²/4 = 0.609375, hence y² = 2.4375 and y ≈ 1.56 m.",

    "explanation": "Let the endpoints of the rod be A = (a, 0) and B = (0, b). Since the rod is of length 12 cm, a and b satisfy a² + b² = 144. The point P divides AB such that its distance from A is 3 cm and from B is 9 cm (since 12 − 3 = 9). Using the section formula, the coordinates of P are: P = ((9a + 3×0)/12, (9×0 + 3b)/12) = (3a/4, b/4). Express a and b in terms of P’s coordinates: a = (4/3)x and b = 4y. Substituting these into a² + b² = 144 gives (16x²/9) + 16y² = 144. Multiplying through by 9 yields 16x² + 144y² = 1296, then dividing by 16 results in x² + 9y² = 81.",

The latus rectum is a horizontal line through the focus. Its endpoints lie on the parabola, so substituting y = 3 into x² = 12×3 gives x² = 36, so x = ±6. Therefore, the endpoints of the latus rectum are (6, 3) and (–6, 3). The triangle formed by the vertex (0, 0) and these two points has a base of length 12 (from –6 to 6) and a height of 3 (vertical distance from 0 to 3).

    "explanation": "The condition that the sum of distances from any point on a curve to two fixed points (foci) is constant defines an ellipse. Here, the two flag posts are the foci, and they are 8 m apart, so the distance between the foci is 2c = 8, which gives c = 4. The constant sum of the distances is 10 m, so 2a = 10 and a = 5. The value of b can be found using the relationship b² = a² – c² = 25 – 16 = 9. Assuming the flag posts are aligned on the horizontal axis, the standard form of the ellipse is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1.

The distance between these two symmetric points is 2|y|. The distance from (0, 0) to either (x, y) is √(x² + y²).
