    "correct_answer": "Volume 1: Factorise 3x² – 12x = 3x(x – 4). One may take the dimensions as 3x, (x – 4), and 1.\nVolume 2: Factorise 12ky² + 8ky – 20k = 4k(3y² + 2y – 5). The quadratic factors as (3y + 5)(y – 1) (since 3y² + 2y – 5 = (3y + 5)(y – 1)). Thus, the dimensions can be taken as 4k, 3y + 5, and y – 1.",
    "explanation": "For Volume 1, factor out the common term: 3x² – 12x = 3x(x – 4). Interpreting the volume as the product of three dimensions, one can choose the factors as 3x, (x – 4), and 1 (if a third dimension is not specified, 1 is assumed).\nFor Volume 2, factor out 4k first to get 4k(3y² + 2y – 5). Next, factor the quadratic 3y² + 2y – 5. Using splitting of the middle term, we find that it factors as (3y + 5)(y – 1). Thus, one valid set of dimensions is 4k, 3y + 5, and y – 1.",
