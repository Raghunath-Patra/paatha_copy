    "correct_answer": "900√3 cm²",
    "explanation": "For an equilateral triangle with side a and perimeter 180 cm, we have a = 180/3 = 60 cm. The semiperimeter s = (60 + 60 + 60)/2 = 90 cm. Applying Heron’s formula: Area = √[s(s – a)(s – a)(s – a)] = √[90 × (90 – 60)³] = √[90 × 30³] = √(90 × 27000) = √2430000. Simplifying, note that the area of an equilateral triangle can also be expressed as (√3/4)a² = (√3/4)×3600 = 900√3 cm².",

    "question_text": "The triangular side walls of a flyover are used for advertisements. The sides of the wall are 122 m, 22 m, and 120 m. The advertisements yield an earning of ₹5000 per m² per year. A company hired one of its walls for 3 months. How much rent did it pay?",
    "type": "Numerical",

    "correct_answer": "₹1,650,000",
    "explanation": "First, compute the semiperimeter of the triangle: s = (122 + 22 + 120)/2 = 264/2 = 132 m. Then, s – a = 132 – 122 = 10 m, s – b = 132 – 22 = 110 m, and s – c = 132 – 120 = 12 m. Using Heron’s formula, the area = √(132 × 10 × 110 × 12) = √(1742400) = 1320 m². The annual rent on the wall would be ₹5000 × 1320 = ₹6,600,000. Since the wall is hired for 3 months, which is 1/4 of a year, the rent is ₹6,600,000/4 = ₹1,650,000.",

    "explanation": "Given the sides of the triangle are 15 m, 11 m, and 6 m, the semiperimeter s = (15 + 11 + 6)/2 = 32/2 = 16 m. Then, s – a = 16 – 15 = 1 m, s – b = 16 – 11 = 5 m, and s – c = 16 – 6 = 10 m. Using Heron’s formula, Area = √(16 × 1 × 5 × 10) = √(800) = √(16×50) = 4√50 = 4×5√2 = 20√2 m².",

    "correct_answer": "21√11 cm²",
    "explanation": "Let the third side be c. Since the perimeter is 42 cm, c = 42 – (18 + 10) = 14 cm. The semiperimeter s = 42/2 = 21 cm. Then, s – a = 21 – 18 = 3 cm, s – b = 21 – 10 = 11 cm, and s – c = 21 – 14 = 7 cm. Applying Heron’s formula gives: Area = √(21 × 3 × 11 × 7) = √(4851) = 21√11 cm² (since 4851 factors as 21²×11).",

    "explanation": "Let the sides be 12x, 17x, and 25x. Since the perimeter is 540 cm, 12x + 17x + 25x = 54x = 540, so x = 10. The sides become 120 cm, 170 cm, and 250 cm. The semiperimeter s = 540/2 = 270 cm. Then, s – a = 270 – 120 = 150 cm, s – b = 270 – 170 = 100 cm, and s – c = 270 – 250 = 20 cm. Using Heron’s formula, the area = √(270 × 150 × 100 × 20) = √(81,000,000) = 9000 cm².",

    "explanation": "For the isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are 12 cm each. The third side = 30 – 12 – 12 = 6 cm. The semiperimeter s = 30/2 = 15 cm. Then, s – equal side = 15 – 12 = 3 cm and s – base = 15 – 6 = 9 cm. Using Heron’s formula, Area = √(15 × 3 × 3 × 9) = √(15 × 81) = √1215. Since 1215 = 81×15 and √81 = 9, the area = 9√15 cm².",
