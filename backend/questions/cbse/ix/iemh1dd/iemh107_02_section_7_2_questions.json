    "correct_answer": "Correct vertex correspondence is crucial because it establishes which sides and angles from one triangle match with which in the other triangle. For example, if triangle PQR is congruent to triangle ABC with the correspondence P ↔ A, Q ↔ B, and R ↔ C, then side PQ must equal side AB, angle Q must equal angle B, and so on. This correspondence ensures each pair of corresponding parts is equal, fulfilling the definition of congruence.",

Step 5: To construct the second congruent triangle, repeat the steps starting with a new base DE of 6 cm. This ensures both triangles are equilateral and congruent.",
    "explanation": "Using a compass and straightedge ensures precision.

If ∠B (or ∠E) is the included angle between AB and BC (or DE and EF), then by the SAS postulate, the triangles are congruent. However, if the angle is not the included angle, more information is required to conclude congruence.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Recognize that the SAS postulate (Side-Angle-Side) requires the angle to be between the two given sides for congruence. Step 2: Here, it is given that AB = DE and BC = EF, and we also have ∠B = ∠E. Step 3: If ∠B is the angle between AB and BC in triangle ABC, and similarly in triangle DEF, then the triangles are congruent by SAS. Step 4: If the stated angle is not included between the two sides, the information is not sufficient for congruence. The answer depends on the position of the angle.",
