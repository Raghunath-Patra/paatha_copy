    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Geometry evolved from practical techniques used for land measurement and construction in Egyptian and Babylonian cultures to a systematic, deductively proven science in Greek civilization. While earlier methods focused on recording results and applying them directly for tasks like redrawing land boundaries or constructing buildings, Greek mathematicians introduced rigorous proofs and logical structures. Thales is noted for his proof regarding the bisecting property of a circle’s diameter, and later, Euclid compiled and systematized existing knowledge in his treatise 'Elements', dividing it into thirteen books that influenced mathematical thought for generations.",
    "explanation": "The answer should include that the Egyptians and Babylonians used geometry pragmatically without theoretical justification, whereas Greeks introduced the idea of proving properties logically, thus creating a systematic and generalized mathematical framework.

Since AB is the diameter, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the angle ACB is a right angle (90°), which means that the circle is bisected into two congruent arcs by the diameter AB. Hence, the diameter splits the circle into two equal halves.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Draw circle with center O and diameter AB. Step 2: Select any point C on the circle to form triangle ACB. Step 3: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle.
