    "explanation": "We use the formula for the surface area of a sphere: SA = 4πr², with π = 22/7.\nFor (i) r = 10.5 cm: 10.5² = 110.25, so SA = 4 × (22/7) × 110.25 = (4 × 22 × 110.25)/7 = 9702/7 = 1386 cm².\nFor (ii) r = 5.6 cm: 5.6² = 31.36, so SA = 4 × (22/7) × 31.36 = (88 × 31.36)/7 ≈ 394.24 cm².\nFor (iii) r = 14 cm: 14² = 196, so SA = 4 × (22/7) × 196 = (4 × 22 × 196)/7 = 2464 cm².",

    "explanation": "For a sphere, SA = 4πr². When the diameter is given, first calculate the radius (r = diameter/2).\n(i) For diameter 14 cm, r = 7 cm. Thus, SA = 4 × (22/7) × 7² = 4 × (22/7) × 49 = 4 × 22 × 7 = 616 cm².\n(ii) For diameter 21 cm, r = 10.5 cm. Then, SA = 4 × (22/7) × (10.5)². Since (10.5)² = 110.25, SA = (4 × 22 × 110.25)/7 = 1386 cm².\n(iii) For diameter 3.5 m, r = 1.75 m. Then, SA = 4 × (22/7) × (1.75)². Here (1.75)² = 3.0625, so SA = (4 × 22 × 3.0625)/7 = 38.5 m².",

    "explanation": "For a hemisphere, the total surface area includes the curved surface area and the area of the circular base. The curved surface area is 2πr² and the base area is πr². Thus, total surface area = 2πr² + πr² = 3πr².\nFor r = 10 cm and π = 3.14, total surface area = 3 × 3.14 × 10² = 3 × 3.14 × 100 = 942 cm².",

    "correct_answer": "Approximately ₹41.57.",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the inner radius: r = 10.5/2 = 5.25 cm. The total inner surface area of a hemisphere is the sum of the curved surface area and the base area, which equals 3πr². Using π = 22/7, we have:\nArea = 3 × (22/7) × (5.25)². Here, (5.25)² = 27.5625, so area = (3 × 22 × 27.5625)/7 ≈ (66 × 27.5625)/7 ≈ 1818.75/7 ≈ 259.82 cm².\nThe cost per cm² is ₹16/100 = ₹0.16.
