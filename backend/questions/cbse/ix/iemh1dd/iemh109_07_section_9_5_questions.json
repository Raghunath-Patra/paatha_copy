    "correct_answer": "Proof: Let ABCD be a cyclic quadrilateral inscribed in a circle. Consider the inscribed angles ∠A and ∠C. ∠A intercepts arc BCD and ∠C intercepts arc DAB. Since the entire circle measures 360°, the sum of arcs BCD and DAB is 360°. Therefore, the measures of ∠A and ∠C are ½(arc BCD) and ½(arc DAB) respectively. Their sum is ½(arc BCD + arc DAB) = ½×360° = 180°. Thus, ∠A + ∠C = 180°.",

By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ∠CBD = ½∠COD = 30°. Also, since AB is a diameter, the angle in the semicircle, ∠ACB, is 90°. In triangle BCE, the sum of interior angles is 180°, so ∠CEB = 180° - 90° - 30° = 60°. Hence, ∠AEB = 60°.",
