Since in any circle, the perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord, let M and N be the midpoints of AB and CD respectively. Therefore, AM = MB and CN = ND. In the right triangles OMA and ONC, we have OA = OC (both are radii), AM = CN (since AB = CD, their halves are equal), and OM and ON are the perpendiculars from O. By the Pythagorean theorem, OM = ON. Hence, the perpendicular distances from the centre to the chords are equal, proving the statement.",

EO is common.\n2. ∠LEO = ∠MEO (because they are related to the equal angles ∠AEQ and ∠DEQ).\n3. ∠LOE = ∠MOE, determined by the angle sum property in right triangles.\nThus, by the ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) criterion, triangles OLE and OME are congruent, which implies OL = OM. Consequently, by Theorem 9.6 (chords equidistant from the centre are equal), AB = CD.",

Drop perpendiculars from the centre O onto the chords to get points L and M.\n3. Show that the triangles OLE and OME are congruent via ASA: one side (EO) is common, and the angles are equal due to the given condition and the right angles at L and M.\n4. From the congruency, deduce OL = OM (equal distances from the centre to the chords).\n5. Finally, invoke Theorem 9.6 to conclude that equal perpendicular distances imply equal chords, hence AB = CD.",
