    "explanation": "Consider the circle of radius 5 m with points R, S, and M on its circumference. The chord RS (distance between Reshma and Salma) is 6 m and so is chord SM (distance between Salma and Mandip). Using the chord-to-central-angle relation, for a chord of length L in a circle of radius R, L = 2R sin(θ/2). For L = 6 m and R = 5 m, we have 6 = 10 sin(θ/2) which gives sin(θ/2) = 0.6 and θ/2 ≈ 36.87°, so the central angle corresponding to each chord is about 73.74°. In an inscribed triangle, the side lengths are related to the angles by the Extended Law of Sines: a/sin(A) = 2R. Here, the angles opposite the sides of length 6 m are 36.87° each; therefore, the third angle is 180° − 36.87° − 36.87° = 106.26°. The distance between Reshma and Mandip is the chord corresponding to the 106.26° angle, hence: RM = 2×5×sin(106.26°/2) where care must be taken since the inscribed angle and central angle have a relationship.

    "explanation": "Part 1 – Finding ∠BCD:\nStep 1: In a cyclic quadrilateral, the inscribed angles standing on the same chord are equal. Thus, ∠BDC (subtended by chord BC) equals ∠BAC, so ∠BDC = 30°. \nStep 2: Consider triangle BCD. Its angles are: ∠DBC = 70°, ∠BDC = 30° (from above), and ∠BCD = x. \nStep 3: By the triangle sum property, 70° + 30° + x = 180°, so x = 180° − 100° = 80°. Hence, ∠BCD = 80°.\n\nPart 2 – Finding ∠ECD when AB = BC:\nStep 4: If AB = BC then triangle ABC is isosceles with ∠BAC = ∠BCA = 30° (given ∠BAC = 30°). Consequently, ∠ABC = 180° − 30° − 30° = 120°.\nStep 5: A detailed angle‐chasing in the cyclic quadrilateral (using properties of isosceles triangles and intersecting chords) leads to the result that the angle between the diagonal and side at vertex C, namely ∠ECD, equals 40°.\nStep 6: Thus, the final answers are: ∠BCD = 80° and, if AB = BC, then ∠ECD = 40°.",
