The acceptance of undefined terms such as point, line, and plane avoids circular definitions, allowing for a clear and unambiguous framework. This approach ensures that more complex theorems, such as Theorem 5.1 about line intersections, can be proved rigorously using a minimal set of assumptions. Overall, this method called axiomatic-deductive reasoning underpins the structure of modern mathematics.",
    "explanation": "The logical foundation of geometry rests on the acceptance of a small set of self-evident truths (axioms and postulates) and undefined terms. These assumptions allow mathematicians to build complex structures and proofs without the need to define every basic concept.
