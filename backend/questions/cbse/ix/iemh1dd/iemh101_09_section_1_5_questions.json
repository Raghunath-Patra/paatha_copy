The product a^(p/q) × a^(r/s) can be expressed using a common denominator, say qs: a^(p/q) = (a^(ps))/(a^(q s))¹ and a^(r/s) = (a^(rq))/(a^(q s))¹. Alternatively, by defining a^(p/q) as ( q√(a))^p, one can raise both sides of the equations to the power qs to compare them, using the property that (a^(p/q))^(qs) = a^(ps) and similarly a^(r/s)^(qs) = a^(rq). Thus, (a^(m) × a^(n))^(qs) = a^(ps + rq) = a^((p/q + r/s) × qs). Taking the qs-th root on both sides, we obtain a^(m) × a^(n) = a^(m+n).",
