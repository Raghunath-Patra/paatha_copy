    "explanation": "We use the formula for the volume of a cone: V = (1/3)πr²h, and π is taken as 22/7. (i) For r = 6 cm and h = 7 cm: V = (1/3)*(22/7)*6²*7 = (1/3)*(22/7)*36*7. The 7 cancels: = (1/3)*22*36 = 264 cm³. (ii) For r = 3.5 cm and h = 12 cm: V = (1/3)*(22/7)*(3.5)²*12. Now (3.5)² = 12.25, so V = (1/3)*(22/7)*12.25*12. Multiplying 12.25*12 gives 147. Therefore, V = (1/3)*(22*147/7). Since 147/7 = 21, we have V = (1/3)*22*21 = 154 cm³.",

    "correct_answer": "(i) Approximately 1.232 litres (1232 cm³), (ii) Approximately 0.314 litres (314.29 cm³)",
    "explanation": "For a cone, the height is needed. (i) Given r = 7 cm and slant height l = 25 cm, first find h using l² = r² + h²: h = √(25² – 7²) = √(625 – 49) = √576 = 24 cm. Then volume V = (1/3)*(22/7)*7²*24. Note 7² = 49, and 49/7 = 7 so V = (1/3)*22*7*24 = 1232 cm³ which converts to 1.232 litres (since 1000 cm³ = 1 litre). (ii) Given h = 12 cm and l = 13 cm, find r: r = √(13² – 12²) = √(169 – 144) = √25 = 5 cm. Then V = (1/3)*(22/7)*5²*12 = (1/3)*(22/7)*25*12. Compute 25*12 = 300, so V = (1/3)*(22*300/7) = (6600/21) ≈ 314.29 cm³, which is approximately 0.314 litres.",

Then V = (1/3)*(22/7)*3.0625*12. First, (22/7)*3.0625 = (22×3.0625)/7 = 67.375/7 = 9.625. Next, V = (1/3)*9.625*12 = (9.625×12)/3 = 115.5/3 = 38.5 m³.

    "explanation": "When the triangle is rotated about the side of length 5 cm, the distance from the axis (which becomes the radius) is 12 cm and the height is 5 cm.

From Question 7, the volume when rotated about the 12-cm side was (6600/21) cm³ (approximately 314.29 cm³). The ratio is (6600/21):(15840/21) = 6600:15840, which simplifies to 5:12.",

    "correct_answer": "Volume ≈ 86.63 m³; Curved surface area ≈ 99.57 m².",
    "explanation": "First, the volume of a cone is given by V = (1/3)πr²h. The diameter is 10.5 m, so the radius r = 10.5/2 = 5.25 m and the height h = 3 m. Thus, V = (1/3)*(22/7)*(5.25)²*3. Notice the factor 3 cancels the 1/3, so V = (22/7)*(5.25)². Since (5.25)² = 27.5625, then V = (22*27.5625)/7 ≈ 606.375/7 ≈ 86.63 m³. Next, the canvas covers only the curved surface area (CSA) of the cone: CSA = πrl, where l is the slant height calculated by l = √(r² + h²) = √(27.5625 + 9) = √36.5625 ≈ 6.05 m. Therefore, CSA = (22/7)*5.25*6.05 ≈ (22*31.72625)/7 ≈ 697/7 ≈ 99.57 m².",
