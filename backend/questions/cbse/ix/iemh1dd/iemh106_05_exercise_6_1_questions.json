    "correct_answer": "∠BOE = 30° and reflex ∠COE = 250°.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: When two lines intersect, vertical angles are equal. Since lines AB and CD intersect at O, the angle ∠AOC is vertically opposite to ∠BOD. Therefore, ∠AOC = ∠BOD = 40°.\nStep 2: The problem gives ∠AOC + ∠BOE = 70°. Substituting 40° for ∠AOC, we get:\n  40° + ∠BOE = 70° ⇒ ∠BOE = 70° − 40° = 30°.\nStep 3: To find the reflex ∠COE, first determine the smaller angle between rays OC and OE. In the diagram the rays usually occur in order. Observe that line AB and line CD form a pair of straight lines (each giving 180° at O). Using the fact that OB (a ray on line AB) and OC (a ray on line CD) form an angle of 180° − ∠AOC = 180° − 40° = 140° and that ∠BOE = 30° (the angle from OB to OE), the smaller angle between OC and OE is given by:\n  ∠(smaller COE) = 140° − 30° = 110°.\nStep 4: The reflex angle is the larger angle between the same rays, i.e.,\n  reflex ∠COE = 360° − 110° = 250°.\nThus, ∠BOE = 30° and the reflex angle ∠COE = 250°.",

    "type": "Numerical",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "c = 126°.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Since ray OP is perpendicular to line XY, and assuming that P, X, and Y are collinear (with XY being the line), the angle between OP and OX is 90°. Note that ∠POM = a and ∠XOM = b lie between OP and OX. Thus:\n  a + b = 90°.\nStep 2: Given the ratio a : b = 2 : 3, let a = 2k and b = 3k. Then:\n  2k + 3k = 90° ⇒ 5k = 90° ⇒ k = 18°.\nThus, a = 36° and b = 54°.\nStep 3: Since points M and N lie on the same line MN, the rays OM and ON form a straight line. Depending on the arrangement, the angle between ray OX (which lies along line XY) and ON is the external angle of the angle between OX and OM. In this configuration, the smaller angle between OX and OM is 54° (i.e., b = 54°). Because OM and ON are opposite directions along line MN, the angle between OX and ON is the supplement of 54°:\n  c = 180° − 54° = 126°.\nThus, the required value of c is 126°.",

    "correct_answer": "Since the angles around point O add up to 360° and are given as ∠BOC = x, ∠AOC = y, ∠BOD = w, and ∠AOD = z, the condition x + y = w + z implies 2(x + y) = 360°, so x + y = 180°.

Substitute into the above equation:\n  (x + y) + (x + y) = 360° ⇒ 2(x + y) = 360° ⇒ x + y = 180°.\nStep 3: The sum of the angles ∠BOC (which has measure x) and ∠AOC (which has measure y) is 180°. By the Linear Pair Axiom (or by the definition of collinearity), this means that the non‐common arms corresponding to these angles (rays OA and OB) form a straight line.\nStep 4: Therefore, A, O, and B are collinear, and AOB is a line.\nThus, the condition x + y = w + z leads to the conclusion that AOB is a straight line.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "By assigning measures relative to a fixed line, we can show that if OP lies along one direction and OQ is the opposite (since POQ is a straight line), with OR ⟂ PQ, then ∠POR = 90°. Let ∠POS = θ (with OS between OP and OR). Consequently, the angle between OS and OQ is (180° − (90° + θ)) = 90° − θ, so that ∠QOS = (90° − θ) + 90° = 180° − θ. Then, (∠QOS – ∠POS) = (180° − θ − θ) = 180° − 2θ, and half of this is 90° − θ, which equals ∠ROS (the angle between OR (at 90°) and OS (at θ)). Hence, ∠ROS = 1/2 (∠QOS – ∠POS).",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Since POQ is a line, the angle ∠POQ = 180°. Ray OR is perpendicular to PQ; assuming OP is along PQ, ∠POR = 90°.\nStep 2: Let the measure of ∠POS = θ, where OS lies between OP and OR. Then, the angle between OR and OS is ∠ROS = 90° − θ.\nStep 3: The ray OS forms with OQ (the ray opposite to OP along line PQ) an angle ∠QOS. Since OP and OQ are opposite rays, the angle between them is 180°. Knowing that ∠POS = θ and ∠POR = 90°, the measure of the smaller angle between OS and OQ is:\n  ∠QOS = 180° − (90° + θ) = 90° − θ + 90° = 180° − θ.\nStep 4: Now, compute ∠QOS − ∠POS:\n  (180° − θ) − θ = 180° − 2θ.\nTaking half of this difference gives:\n  ½(180° − 2θ) = 90° − θ,\nwhich is exactly ∠ROS.\nThus, it has been proven that ∠ROS = ½(∠QOS − ∠POS).",
