    "explanation": "To convert each fraction to decimal you divide the numerator by the denominator. For fractions like 36/100 and 4 1/8, the division terminates giving a finite number of digits. For fractions such as 1/11, 3/13, and 2/11, the division yields a repeating cycle of remainders which produces a repeating (recurring) decimal pattern. In 1/11, the remainder leads to the repetition of the block '09'. Similarly, 3/13 and 2/11 lead to repeating blocks '230769' and '18' respectively. For 329/400, the denominator factors completely into powers of 2 and 5, ensuring a terminating decimal.",

    "question_text": "You know that 1/7 = 0.̅142857. Can you predict what the decimal expansions of 2/7, 3/7, 4/7, 5/7, 6/7 are, without actually doing the long division? If so, how?",

    "explanation": "When performing the long division for 1/7, you notice that the remainders repeat in a cycle producing the repeating block 142857. Multiplying the numerator by 2, 3, etc., amounts to a cyclic permutation of the remainder sequence. Therefore, the decimal expansion for 2/7, 3/7, ... 6/7 are obtained by cyclically shifting the digits of 142857.

For (ii): For a number with non-repeating part '0.4' and repeating part '7', let x = 0.4777…. Multiplying by 10 gives 10x = 4.777…; subtracting the original x (which aligns the repeating parts) results in 9x = 4.3, so x = 4.3/9 = 43/90. For (iii): The notation 0.̅0̅0̅1̅ represents 0.000100010001… with the block '0001' repeating. Using the formula for repeating decimals, one finds that this is equal to 1/9999.",

    "correct_answer": "One possible answer is to take numbers of the form 5/7 + k·((9/11 − 5/7)/n) where k is chosen such that the decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring. For example, let x = (π - 3)/100 (an irrational number). Then the three numbers: 5/7 + x, 5/7 + 2x, and 5/7 + 3x are irrational and, if chosen properly, lie between 5/7 and 9/11.",
    "explanation": "Since the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational, one method to generate an irrational number in any interval is to add a small irrational number to the lower bound. Here, by choosing x = (π - 3)/100, we ensure that 5/7 + x, 5/7 + 2x, and 5/7 + 3x are all irrational. It is important to verify that these sums fall between 5/7 and 9/11, which they do if x is chosen sufficiently small.",
