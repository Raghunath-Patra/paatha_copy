    "correct_answer": "A detailed proof involves describing the experimental setup where a container is filled with water to the brim. When the sphere is fully submerged, the water that overflows into a trough is collected and measured. This displaced water volume is found to be equal to the volume calculated using V = (4/3)πr³ for various spheres of different radii. The consistency of these measurements confirms the formula experimentally. The steps include: (1) measuring the sphere's diameter to determine its radius; (2) computing the theoretical volume using (4/3)πr³; (3) submerging the sphere and measuring the overflow; and (4) comparing the two values to observe their near equality.",
    "explanation": "The experiment relies on the principle that the volume of the displaced water equals the volume of the submerged object. By repeatedly performing the experiment with spheres of varying sizes, and consistently finding that the measured displaced volume is approximately equal to the volume computed using (4/3)πr³, the formula is verified.
