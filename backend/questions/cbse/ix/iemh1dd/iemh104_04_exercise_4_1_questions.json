    "correct_answer": "x - 2y = 0 (or equivalently, x = 2y)",
    "explanation": "Let the cost of the notebook be represented by x and the cost of the pen by y. The statement 'the cost of a notebook is twice the cost of a pen' can be translated into the equation x = 2y. Rearranging this equation to the standard form ax + by + c = 0 gives x - 2y = 0, where a = 1, b = -2, and c = 0.",

    "explanation": "For each given equation, the goal is to rewrite it in the standard form ax + by + c = 0 by moving all terms to one side of the equation:\n\n(i) Starting with 2x + 3y = 9.3̅5̅, subtract 9.3̅5̅ from both sides to obtain 2x + 3y - 9.3̅5̅ = 0.\n\n(ii) The equation x – y/5 – 10 = 0 is already arranged in the required form with a = 1, b = -1/5, and c = -10.\n\n(iii) For -2x + 3y = 6, subtract 6 from both sides to get -2x + 3y - 6 = 0.\n\n(iv) For x = 3y, subtract 3y from both sides to obtain x - 3y = 0.\n\n(v) For 2x = -5y, add 5y to both sides to write 2x + 5y = 0.\n\n(vi) The equation 3x + 2 = 0 can be seen as 3x + 0y + 2 = 0.\n\n(vii) The equation y - 2 = 0 is rewritten as 0x + y - 2 = 0.\n\n(viii) For 5 = 2x, subtract 2x from both sides to yield -2x + 5 = 0.\n\nEach rearrangement follows the basic principle that adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of an equation does not change its solutions.",
