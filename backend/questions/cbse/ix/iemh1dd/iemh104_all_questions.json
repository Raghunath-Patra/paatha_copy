For every real number chosen for x, there exists a corresponding y computed by this formula, meaning there is a one-to-one correspondence between every real number x and a solution pair (x, y). Hence there are infinitely many solutions since the set of real numbers is infinite. A similar argument follows if a ≠ 0 and we solve for x in terms of y.",
    "explanation": "We start with the equation ax + by + c = 0. Assuming b ≠ 0, express y as y = (-ax - c)/b. Since x can be any real number, this produces a unique y for each x, leading to infinitely many solution pairs.

The value of m, the slope, determines the steepness and direction of the line. If m is positive, the line rises from left to right; if m is negative, it falls from left to right; if m is zero, the line is horizontal. Thus, m controls both the angle of inclination and the overall orientation of the line.",
    "explanation": "Since the equation y = mx yields y = 0 when x = 0, it implies that the line always goes through the origin. The slope m indicates the change in y for a unit change in x. A positive m causes an upward trend, a negative m causes a downward trend, and m = 0 results in a horizontal line.
