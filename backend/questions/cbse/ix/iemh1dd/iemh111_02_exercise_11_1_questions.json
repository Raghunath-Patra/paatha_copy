    "explanation": "Step 1: Use the curved surface area (CSA) formula: CSA = π × r × l. Here CSA = 308 cm², l = 14 cm and π = 22/7. \nStep 2: Solve for r: r = CSA / (π × l) = 308 / ((22/7) × 14). Note that (22/7) × 14 = 44, so r = 308/44 = 7 cm. \nStep 3: The total surface area (TSA) includes the CSA and the area of the base (which is a circle): TSA = πrl + πr². \nStep 4: Substitute the values: CSA = 308 cm² and base area = (22/7) × 7² = (22/7) × 49 = 154 cm². \nStep 5: Hence, TSA = 308 + 154 = 462 cm².",
