For a chord AB = r, using the chord–central angle relationship we have: r = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle subtended by the chord. \nStep 2: Simplify: 1 = 2 sin(θ/2) so sin(θ/2) = 1/2. \nStep 3: Thus, θ/2 = 30° and hence the central angle θ = 60°. \nStep 4: Now, by the inscribed angle theorem, an inscribed angle subtended by a chord equals half the measure of the corresponding central angle if the vertex lies on the same (minor) arc. Therefore, the angle subtended on the minor arc is 60°/2 = 30°. \nStep 5: For a point lying on the major arc, the intercepted arc is the reflex arc having measure 360° − 60° = 300°.

    "explanation": "Step 1: In the circle, consider the intersecting chords AC and BD with intersection point E. The measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle. \nStep 2: For ∠BEC (which measures 130°), the intercepted arcs are arc BC and arc ED. That is, 130° = ½ (arc BC + arc ED), so arc BC + arc ED = 260°. \nStep 3: Next, consider ∠ECD = 20°. This inscribed angle intercepts arc ED, so arc ED = 2 × 20° = 40°. \nStep 4: Substitute arc ED = 40° into the previous sum to get arc BC = 260° − 40° = 220°. \nStep 5: Now, the inscribed angle ∠BAC subtends arc BC. However, because an inscribed angle always subtends the arc that does not include the vertex, we choose the smaller (reflex) measure of arc BC.

Its angles are: ∠DBC = 70°, ∠BDC = 30° (from above), and ∠BCD = x. \nStep 3: By the triangle sum property, 70° + 30° + x = 180°, so x = 180° − 100° = 80°.
