Then segment AC + C C′ + C′B equals AB. But since both C and C′ are midpoints, AC = CB and AC′ = C′B.

    "explanation": "Step 1: The equation of the circle centered at A: x² + y² = 49. \nStep 2: The equation of the circle centered at B: (x - 7)² + y² = 49. \nStep 3: Subtract the two equations to find x: (x-7)² - x² = 0. Expand: (x² - 14x + 49) - x² = 0, so -14x + 49 = 0, giving x = 3.5. \nStep 4: Substitute x = 3.5 into x² + y² = 49: (3.5)² + y² = 49 → 12.25 + y² = 49, so y² = 36.75. \nStep 5: Thus, y = √36.75 ≈ 6.062 (using the positive value for one of the intersection points).",

    "correct_answer": "Extending DE indefinitely means that starting from segment DE, we can continue drawing the line in both directions without any bound. This reinforces the idea that while a segment has fixed finite length, a straight line (as an extended form) is infinite in extent and is abstracted as one-dimensional without width or area.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: According to Postulate 2, a terminated line (segment) can be extended indefinitely in both directions. \nStep 2: This means that the process of extension does not impose a limit on the line's length. \nStep 3: The segment DE of 10 units is only a part of the complete line, which as a conceptual entity extends infinitely. \nStep 4: The concept highlights the abstraction in geometry where a line, despite being drawn as a finite segment on paper, is understood as a one-dimensional object with no bounds.",
