    "correct_answer": "Firstly, since M is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC, we know that AM = MB and, by the circle theorem, CM is equal to these segments. With DM = CM (given), consider triangles ΔAMC and ΔBMD: they have CM common, AM = MB, and the angles at M are vertically equal; hence by the SAS criterion, ΔAMC ≅ ΔBMD. This congruence implies that ∠DBC is a right angle (as corresponding angles in congruent configurations), and further, by comparing parts, ΔDBC ≅ ΔACB. Finally, using the property of a right triangle that the length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse, we deduce that CM = ½ AB.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: In right triangle ABC (with right angle at C), the midpoint M of the hypotenuse AB has the property that AM = MB, and it is known that the median from the right angle to the hypotenuse is equal to half the hypotenuse.\nStep 2: With point D chosen such that DM = CM, consider triangles ΔAMC and ΔBMD. They share side CM, have AM = MB (since M is midpoint), and the included angles at M are equal (vertical angles). Therefore, by SAS, the triangles are congruent, yielding ΔAMC ≅ ΔBMD.\nStep 3: This congruence implies corresponding angles are equal; in particular, it can be shown that ∠DBC is a right angle.\nStep 4: Furthermore, by considering other corresponding parts, one can prove that ΔDBC ≅ ΔACB (often by a combination of congruence and the properties pertaining to the altitude in a right triangle).\nStep 5: Finally, by the well-known property of the median to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we conclude that CM = ½ AB.\nThis solution uses properties of right triangles, midpoints, and triangle congruence (SAS), as well as known theorems about medians in right triangles.",

(iii) Similarly, if AB < DE, choose point M on DE so that ME = AB and use analogous reasoning. Thus, in every case, triangle congruence is established.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Start with triangles ABC and DEF where ∠B = ∠E, ∠C = ∠F and BC = EF. \nStep 2: Consider three cases for the side AB compared to DE. \nCase (i): Directly AB = DE leads to ASA using SAS. \nCase (ii): If AB > DE, choose P on AB such that PB = DE. By SAS, ΔPBC ≅ ΔDEF. This forces the remaining segment AP to vanish (i.e. P coinciding with A), thus AB must equal DE. \nCase (iii): If AB < DE, reverse the roles and select an appropriate point on DE. \nTherefore, by exhaustively covering all possibilities, the ASA theorem is proven using the SAS axiom.",
