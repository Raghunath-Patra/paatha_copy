    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The criteria for triangle congruence include SSS, SAS, ASA, and AAS. For example, the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criterion states that if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent. Proof: Assume triangles ΔABC and ΔDEF have AB = DE, AC = DF, and ∠A = ∠D. By placing the triangles so that side AB coincides with DE, point C must overlay point F due to equal side lengths and the included equal angle. Hence, by the principle of superposition, the triangles are congruent.",
    "explanation": "To prove the SAS criterion, first align one of the congruent sides. The congruence of the included angle ensures the second side falls into place identically in both triangles. Any deviation would violate the equality of side lengths or angles, hence confirming congruence. This reasoning validates that corresponding parts of congruent triangles are equal.",

    "correct_answer": "Proof: Consider triangle ΔABC with sides AB, BC, and AC. Extend side AC to a point D such that C lies between A and D. By the congruence of triangles and the properties of exterior angles, ∠CBD is greater than ∠BA C. Using the properties of straight lines, one can deduce AB + BC > AC. A similar approach can be applied to the other two sides, thus proving the triangle inequality.",
    "explanation": "A common method starts by extending one side of the triangle. By analyzing the external angle and applying the triangle sum property, one concludes that the external segment must be shorter than the sum of the two sides creating it, hence establishing the inequality for all three combinations of sides.
