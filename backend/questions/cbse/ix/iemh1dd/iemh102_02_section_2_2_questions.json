By rearranging and combining like terms, h(x) remains a polynomial since each term is of the form (aᵢ+bᵢ)xⁱ (if one polynomial lacks a term, treat its coefficient as 0). The degree of h(x) will be the maximum of n and m, provided that the leading coefficients do not cancel each other. If cancellation occurs, the degree could be lower, but h(x) will still be a polynomial.",
    "explanation": "To prove the closure under addition, we note that adding corresponding coefficients of like powers yields new coefficients that are still constants. Thus, h(x) is composed entirely of terms with non-negative integer exponents. The highest power with a non-zero coefficient in h(x) determines its degree.
