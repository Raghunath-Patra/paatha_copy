Consider the alternate interior angles ∠1 (at point A) and ∠2 (at point B). Since l ∥ m, by the Corresponding Angles Postulate, the angle corresponding to ∠1 in line m is equal to ∠1. Because adjacent angles on a straight line sum to 180°, the corresponding angle is supplementary to ∠2. Therefore, ∠1 + angle corresponding to ∠1 = 180° and similarly, ∠2 plus that same angle = 180°. Hence, ∠1 = ∠2. This proves that the alternate interior angles are equal.",
