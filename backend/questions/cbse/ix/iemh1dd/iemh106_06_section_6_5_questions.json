Similarly, let CG be the bisector of ∠BCS, so that ∠BCG = ½∠BCS. Since BE is parallel to CG, the corresponding angles ∠ABE and ∠BCG are equal. Hence, ½∠ABQ = ½∠BCS, which implies that ∠ABQ = ∠BCS. Since ∠ABQ and ∠BCS are corresponding angles created by the transversal AD, the equality of these angles ensures that lines PQ and RS are parallel (by the Converse of the Corresponding Angles Postulate).",

If each line in a set is parallel to a given line, then every pair of lines in this set is parallel.
