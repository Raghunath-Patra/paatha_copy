    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Proof: In a square, by definition, all sides are equal and all angles are 90°. Let the square be ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at O. Since AB = BC = CD = DA and the angles at the vertices are right angles, triangles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are congruent by SAS. Thus, O is the midpoint of both diagonals (bisecting them). Also, using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle AOB, AC = √(AB² + BC²) = √(2 × AB²), showing both diagonals are equal. To prove they are perpendicular, consider triangles AOB and BOC; since both are right triangles, and all corresponding parts are congruent, the angle between AC and BD is 90°. Hence, the diagonals are equal, bisect each other, and are perpendicular.",
    "explanation": "The proof uses the following steps: 1. Recognize the properties of a square (equal sides and right angles). 2. Apply the congruency criteria (SAS) to the triangles formed by the diagonals. 3. Use the Pythagorean theorem to show the diagonals are equal. 4.
