    "explanation": "First, the volume of a cone is given by V = (1/3)πr²h. The diameter is 10.5 m, so the radius r = 10.5/2 = 5.25 m and the height h = 3 m. Thus, V = (1/3)*(22/7)*(5.25)²*3. Notice the factor 3 cancels the 1/3, so V = (22/7)*(5.25)². Since (5.25)² = 27.5625, then V = (22*27.5625)/7 ≈ 606.375/7 ≈ 86.63 m³. Next, the canvas covers only the curved surface area (CSA) of the cone: CSA = πrl, where l is the slant height calculated by l = √(r² + h²) = √(27.5625 + 9) = √36.5625 ≈ 6.05 m.
