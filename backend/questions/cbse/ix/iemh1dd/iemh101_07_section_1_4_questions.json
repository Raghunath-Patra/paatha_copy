(iii) However, when performing these operations between two irrational numbers, the result can be either rational or irrational.",
    "explanation": "For instance, adding or subtracting a rational number to an irrational such as 2 + √3 results in an irrational number because the irrational part doesn't cancel out.

    "explanation": "The construction relies on the fact that triangle OBD is right-angled. With OB = (x - 1)/2 and OD = (x + 1)/2, applying the Pythagoras theorem gives: BD² = OD² - OB² = x. Thus, BD = √x, which visually shows the square root of x along the perpendicular.",
