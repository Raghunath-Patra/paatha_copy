    "correct_answer": "(i) Using r = 7 cm: Volume = (4/3)π(7³) = (4/3)×(22/7)×343 = 30184/21 ≈ 1437.33 cm³. (ii) Using r = 0.63 m (or 63 cm): Volume = (4/3)π(63³) = (4/3)×(22/7)×(63³) ≈ 1.047 m³.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Use the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = (4/3)πr³, and substitute the given radius. (i) For r = 7 cm, compute r³ = 7³ = 343. Then, V = (4/3)×(22/7)×343. Notice that 343 ÷ 7 = 49, so the expression simplifies to V = (4/3)×22×49 = (4×22×49)/3 = 4312/3, which is approximately 1437.33 cm³. (ii) For r = 0.63 m, it is best to work in one unit. Either convert 0.63 m to 63 cm or work directly in m. Using meters: (0.63)³ ≈ 0.250047, then V = (4/3)×(22/7)×0.250047 ≈ 1.047 m³.",

Then, V = (4/3)×(22/7)×2744. Simplify by dividing 2744 by 7 to get 392, and then multiply: V = (4/3)×22×392 = (4×22×392)/3 = 34496/3 ≈ 11498.67 cm³. (ii) For diameter 21 cm, radius r = 10.5 cm.
