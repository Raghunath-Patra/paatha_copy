By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the angle subtended by chord AC at a point on the circle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same chord. The fact that ∠A + ∠C = 180° implies that the angles on the same chord add up to 180°. This condition is both necessary and sufficient for the quadrilateral to be cyclic. Conversely, if a quadrilateral is cyclic, the sum of the opposite angles is 180°. Thus, the given condition proves that the quadrilateral must be cyclic.",
