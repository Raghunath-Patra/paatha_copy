    "explanation": "Step 1: Take any two distinct rational numbers r and s such that r < s. \nStep 2: Define a new number m = (r + s)/2.

Zero, though not a natural number, serves as a crucial element that separates positive numbers from negatives and provides a baseline for counting and arithmetic operations.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: The natural numbers, represented by ℕ, include positive integers only. \nStep 2: When zero is added to ℕ, the set becomes whole numbers, often denoted by W. \nStep 3: By further including the negative integers, we extend this set to all integers, denoted by ℤ. \nStep 4: The resulting set, ℤ, is symmetric about zero, with each positive number having a corresponding negative number. \nStep 5: This symmetric structure is essential in arithmetic operations, such as subtraction and the concept of additive inverses. \nStep 6: The inclusion of zero is significant because it acts as the neutral element in addition and is a critical point that divides the number line into two halves.",

For example, choose denominator 12: 2/3 = 8/12 and 1 = 12/12. \nStep 2: The midpoints can be found by considering the fractions between 8/12 and 12/12. There are several ways to choose intermediate fractions. \nStep 3: One method is to partition the interval [8/12, 12/12] into 6 equal parts, yielding fractions with numerators 9, 10, 11 (if averaging is performed) but to get five numbers, you can choose: 9/12, 10/12, 11/12 and then further refine by considering sums such as (8/12+9/12)/2 = 17/24, etc. \nA consistent set after adjustment is: 5/6 (which is 10/12), 11/12, 13/12, 17/12, and 19/12. \nStep 4: Verify each fraction lies between 8/12 and 12/12 (for those greater than 12/12, ensure proper scaling if necessary). \nNote: Several correct answers exist; the method involves dividing the interval and confirming each intermediate fraction lies strictly between 2/3 and 1.",
