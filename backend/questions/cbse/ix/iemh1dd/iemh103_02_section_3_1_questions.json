    "explanation": "By mapping each student’s position to an ordered pair (e.g., (5,3)), students learn that just as a dot's position on paper can be fixed using distances from two perpendicular edges, positions in a classroom can be precisely described using grid coordinates.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Two independent pieces of information are essential because they provide unique reference points in two different dimensions. In the street plan example, knowing only the street number or the house number does not suffice to find a specific house; both must be known (e.g., Street 2 and House 5). Similarly, on a sheet of paper, stating that a dot is in the 'upper half' or 'near the left edge' is imprecise. By providing the exact distance from the left edge (5 cm) and the bottom edge (9 cm), the dot’s position is uniquely determined.",
    "explanation": "The explanation involves recognizing that a single measurement can only describe position in one dimension. In a plane, which is two-dimensional, one measurement is insufficient. By specifying coordinates (x, y), where x and y represent distances along mutually perpendicular directions, the location is completely fixed. These examples illustrate that two independent references remove any ambiguity about where a point is located in space.",

    "correct_answer": "To determine the position of a dot on a paper, we first choose two fixed, perpendicular lines (usually the left edge and the bottom edge of the paper). Measure the distance from the dot to the left edge; this is the x-coordinate. Next, measure the distance from the dot to the bottom edge; this is the y-coordinate. The dot’s position is then represented as the ordered pair (x, y). This method eliminates ambiguity since each measurement pertains to a different dimension, thus fully determining the dot's location.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Identify two perpendicular reference lines (left and bottom edges). Step 2: Measure the horizontal distance from the dot to the left edge to obtain x. Step 3: Measure the vertical distance from the dot to the bottom edge to obtain y. Step 4: Combine these measurements into an ordered pair (x, y). This process is fundamental in coordinate geometry, as it leverages the independence of the two measurements to uniquely specify any point on the plane.",

    "correct_answer": "The Cartesian coordinate system offers precise and clear methods to describe positions using ordered pairs, which is beneficial for everyday applications such as seating plans or navigation in neighborhoods. It simplifies the process of locating any point in a two-dimensional space. However, potential limitations include the assumption of a flat, two-dimensional space which might not accurately represent curved or irregular surfaces. Additionally, in real-world settings, uncertainties and measurement errors can affect the precision of coordinate-based descriptions.",
    "explanation": "Benefits: The system provides an unambiguous description of positions using two measured values, which is easily applicable in classroom layouts, maps, and computer graphics. Limitations: Real-world situations, such as geographic mapping, may involve curvature of the earth or obstacles, requiring more sophisticated models. Moreover, human error in measurement can lead to inaccuracies. Overall, while the Cartesian system is extremely useful in many contexts, its simplifying assumptions may not always suffice for complex, real-world problems.",
