Then joining the vertex (O) to the endpoint of this new segment yields the hypotenuse of a right triangle, whose length by the Pythagoras theorem is √(2² + 1²) = √5.

Alternatively, by defining a^(p/q) as ( q√(a))^p, one can raise both sides of the equations to the power qs to compare them, using the property that (a^(p/q))^(qs) = a^(ps) and similarly a^(r/s)^(qs) = a^(rq).
