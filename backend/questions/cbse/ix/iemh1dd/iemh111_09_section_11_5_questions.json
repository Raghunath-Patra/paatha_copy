The lateral surface area of the cylinder is 2πrh. The total surface area of the hemisphere (including its circular base) is 3πr², but since the circular base is in contact with the cylinder, we subtract it mentally and only add the curved surface of the hemisphere, which is 2πr². However, if we consider the cylinder, its top base is not visible and its bottom base (πr²) is visible. Thus, total surface area = Cylinder's lateral area + Cylinder's base area + Hemisphere's curved area = 2πrh + πr² + 2πr² = 2πrh + 3πr².",
