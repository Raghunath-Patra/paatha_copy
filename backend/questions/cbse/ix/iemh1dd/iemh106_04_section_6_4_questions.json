Similarly, since ray OD stands on line AB, we have ∠AOD + ∠BOD = 180°. Equating these two sums gives: ∠AOC + ∠AOD = ∠AOD + ∠BOD. By subtracting ∠AOD from both sides, we obtain ∠AOC = ∠BOD. Similarly, one can prove that ∠AOD = ∠BOC, thereby establishing that vertically opposite angles are equal.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The converse of the Linear Pair Axiom states that if the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then their non-common arms lie on a line. The reasoning behind this is based on geometric constructions and by testing various configurations of adjacent angles. As a counter-example, consider adjacent angles that sum to less than 180° (for example, 60° and 30°); in this case, the non-common arms will not form a straight line because they open up to form an angle less than a straight angle. Thus, the condition that they sum to 180° is both necessary and sufficient for the non-common arms to be collinear.",
    "explanation": "The reasoning involves constructing various examples. Only when the two adjacent angles sum exactly to 180° do the non-common arms become collinear, confirming the converse. In any other case, such as when the angles sum to 90° or 140°, the arms do not lie on the same line. This logical deduction confirms the validity of the converse when its condition is met, and the failure of the collinearity when the condition is not met serves as the counter-example.",
