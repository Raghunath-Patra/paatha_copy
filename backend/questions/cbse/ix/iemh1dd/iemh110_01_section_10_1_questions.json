    "explanation": "The base-height method is simple and efficient for right and certain isosceles triangles where the height is easily determined. Heron’s formula is universally applicable to any triangle provided the three sides are known, making it versatile.

    "correct_answer": "One common derivation begins by expressing the height of the triangle in terms of its sides using the Law of Cosines. Let a, b, c be the sides of the triangle and let the height corresponding to side c be h. The area A = ½ c h. Using the Law of Cosines, one can express one angle in terms of the sides. Then, using the sine of that angle, the height is obtained (h = b sin A). After substituting and simplifying, one introduces the semiperimeter s = (a+b+c)/2 and, through algebraic manipulations and use of identities, arrives at A = √[s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)].",

Taking the square root gives A = (ab)/4 × 2 = ½ ab, which is the standard area formula for a right triangle.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Write s = (a+b+c)/2 and note that s – a = (b+c–a)/2, s – b = (a+c–b)/2, and s – c = (a+b–c)/2. \nStep 2: Substitute these into Heron’s formula: A = √[(s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)]. \nStep 3: For a right triangle, use c² = a²+b² to simplify the expression. \nStep 4: Through algebraic manipulations, show that the product equals (a²b²)/16, so the area becomes (ab)/4 multiplied by 2, yielding ½ ab. \nThis demonstrates the equivalence of both formulas for right triangles.",
