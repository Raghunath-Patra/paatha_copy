Since there are only q possible remainders, if the remainder ever becomes 0, the process terminates, yielding a terminating decimal. If the remainder never becomes 0, by the Pigeonhole Principle, eventually a remainder must repeat. When a remainder repeats, the block of digits between occurrences of the same remainder will repeat indefinitely, thus resulting in a repeating (recurring) decimal expansion.",
