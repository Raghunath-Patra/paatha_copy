    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A point in the Cartesian plane is represented by an ordered pair (x, y), where the order signifies first the horizontal displacement (x-coordinate) and then the vertical displacement (y-coordinate). The uniqueness comes from the fact that the ordered pair specifies exactly one location. For example, (3, 4) means the point is 3 units from the y-axis and 4 units from the x-axis, while (4, 3) indicates 4 units from the y-axis and 3 units from the x-axis. Since the positions along the x- and y-axes are not interchangeable, (3, 4) and (4, 3) are different points.",
    "explanation": "To prove uniqueness, assume two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) represent the same location. Then by the definition of coordinates, x₁ must equal x₂ and y₁ must equal y₂. The ordered pair structure means that the sequence (x, y) matters. Therefore, (3, 4) ≠ (4, 3) because the first number represents the horizontal distance from the y-axis and the second represents the vertical distance from the x-axis. This demonstrates the importance of order in ensuring a unique representation.",

    "correct_answer": "To determine the coordinates of a point, drop perpendicular lines from the point to both the x-axis and the y-axis. The intersection of the perpendicular with the y-axis gives the horizontal distance (x-coordinate) and the intersection with the x-axis gives the vertical distance (y-coordinate). For example, if a point P is 5 units to the right of the y-axis and 3 units above the x-axis, then the coordinates of P are (5, 3). A diagram would show point P with a perpendicular dropping to the x-axis at (5, 0) and to the y-axis at (0, 3).",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Draw the point P in the Cartesian plane. \nStep 2: Draw a horizontal line from P to intersect the y-axis; the distance from this intersection to the origin is the x-coordinate (keeping sign in mind). \nStep 3: Draw a vertical line from P to intersect the x-axis; the distance from this intersection to the origin is the y-coordinate. \nStep 4: Combine these values as an ordered pair (x, y). \nThis method guarantees that every point is uniquely identified.",
