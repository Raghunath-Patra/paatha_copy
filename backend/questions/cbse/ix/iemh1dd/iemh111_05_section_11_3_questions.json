    "correct_answer": "One geometric proof considers a cylinder and an inscribed cone (with the same base and height). By slicing both shapes horizontally, note that at a distance x from the top, the area of the cone's slice is π(r(x))², where r(x) = (r/h)x, while the cylinder's slice has a constant area πr². By comparing these slices and summing over x (or by physically rearranging the slices), it becomes evident that the cone’s volume accumulates to exactly one-third of the cylinder’s volume, hence V_cone = (1/3)πr²h.",
    "explanation": "The proof involves showing that for every horizontal slice, the area in the cone is (x/h)² times the area of the corresponding slice in the cylinder. When integrated from the apex (x = 0) to the base (x = h), the resulting volume of the cone is one-third that of the cylinder. This can also be viewed through a dissection argument where the cone’s slices are rearranged, visually demonstrating the one-third factor.",
