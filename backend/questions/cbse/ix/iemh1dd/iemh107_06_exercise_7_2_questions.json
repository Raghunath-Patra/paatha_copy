    "correct_answer": "By constructing the angle bisectors of ∠B and ∠C meeting at O and joining A to O, we can show that triangles ABO and ACO are congruent by using the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) criterion. This congruence implies that OB = OC and that AO bisects ∠A.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: In triangle ABC, since AB = AC (given), the base angles ∠B and ∠C are equal by the isosceles triangle property. \nStep 2: The internal bisectors of ∠B and ∠C intersect at O. In triangles ABO and ACO, we have AB = AC (given), ∠ABO = ∠ACO (since O lies on the bisectors of the base angles) and AO is common to both triangles. \nStep 3: By the ASA rule, triangles ABO and ACO are congruent. \nStep 4: As a consequence, the corresponding sides OB and OC are equal and the segment AO, which is common, must split the angle at A into two equal parts, hence AO bisects ∠A. \nThis uses congruence of triangles to establish both the equality of OB and OC and the bisector property of AO.",

    "correct_answer": "Since AD is the perpendicular bisector of BC, D is the midpoint of BC and AD ⊥ BC.

    "correct_answer": "In an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC, the altitudes from the base vertices to the equal sides (namely BE to AC and CF to AB) are equal.
