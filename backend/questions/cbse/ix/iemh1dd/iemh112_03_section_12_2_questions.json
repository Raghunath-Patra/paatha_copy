    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the classes in a frequency distribution have varying widths, simply using the height directly proportional to frequency would misrepresent the data because wider classes would naturally have larger areas even if they did not have a greater frequency. To correct for this, the height of each rectangle is adjusted so that the area (which is base × height) accurately reflects the frequency. This is achieved by dividing the frequency by the class width to obtain the frequency density. Multiplying the class width by this adjusted height returns the frequency, ensuring consistency and accurate representation across classes.",
    "explanation": "The adjustment is based on the concept of frequency density. For a class with width w and frequency f, the frequency density is f/w. The height of the rectangle is set equal to this density. This ensures:\n1. For uniform widths, the height remains simply proportional to the frequency.\n2. For varying widths, the area (width × height = width × (f/w) = f) consistently represents the frequency, providing an accurate visual depiction of data distribution.",

Plot the frequency corresponding to each mid-point on a graph, where the x-axis represents the class marks and the y-axis represents the frequency.\n3.

Extend the graph by marking and connecting points for a class preceding the first class and succeeding the last class, assigning a frequency of zero for these points.
