    "correct_answer": "Proof: Let l and m be two parallel lines. Draw any point A on l and construct a perpendicular from A to m, letting the foot of the perpendicular be B. Now, pick any other point C on l and drop a perpendicular to m at D. Since l || m, the angles formed are congruent due to alternate interior angles and corresponding angles postulate. Using properties of congruent right triangles and the fact that parallel translation preserves distances, we can show that AB = CD. Thus, the distance, measured along the common perpendicular, remains constant.",
    "explanation": "Start by assuming any two arbitrary points on one of the lines. By constructing perpendiculars and using properties of parallel lines (alternate interior angles, corresponding arcs), you establish congruent right triangles. The congruency leads to the equality of the lengths of the perpendiculars, which is the distance between the lines. Each logical step uses standard Euclidean postulates and theorems on parallel lines.",

    "correct_answer": "To construct a perpendicular from a point P to a line l: (1) Place the compass at P and draw an arc that cuts line l at two points, Q and R. (2) From Q and R, with the same radius (greater than half the distance between Q and R), draw two arcs that intersect at a point S below or above l. (3) Draw line PS; it is perpendicular to l. This construction guarantees the shortest distance from P to l. For parallel lines, constructing such perpendiculars at different locations results in segments of equal length, thereby confirming that the distance between the lines is constant.",
    "explanation": "The steps describe a classic geometric construction using a compass and straightedge. The method uses arcs to determine equidistant points, ensuring a perpendicular line is drawn from a point to the line.

Since the slopes are equal, the lines are parallel. The distance between two lines in the form Ax + By + C = 0 is given by |C₂ - C₁| / √(A²+B²) (after normalising so that the coefficients of x and y are same). Here, multiply the first equation by 2 to get 6x - 8y + 16 = 0. Now, the distance is |(-10) - 16| / √(6²+(-8)²) = | -26 | / √(36+64) = 26 / 10 = 2.6.",
