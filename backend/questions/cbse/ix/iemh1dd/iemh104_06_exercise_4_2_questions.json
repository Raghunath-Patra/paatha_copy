    "correct_answer": "c) infinitely many solutions",
    "explanation": "The equation y = 3x + 5 represents a straight line in the xy-plane. For any value of x, there corresponds one unique value of y such that the equation is satisfied, which means there are infinitely many (x, y) pairs that satisfy the equation. Therefore, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions.",

    "explanation": "For each equation, choose suitable values for one variable and solve for the other:\n(i) For 2x + y = 7, you can let x = 0 (y = 7), x = 1 (y = 5), x = 2 (y = 3), and x = 3 (y = 1).\n(ii) For πx + y = 9, letting x = 0 gives y = 9; x = 1 gives y = 9 - π; x = 2 gives y = 9 - 2π; and x = 3 gives y = 9 - 3π.\n(iii) For x = 4y, choose values for y and get x = 4y.
