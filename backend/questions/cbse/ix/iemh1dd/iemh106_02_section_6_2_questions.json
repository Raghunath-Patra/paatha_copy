To prove their sum equals the angle formed by the two non-common arms, consider the following: Let ∠ABD and ∠DBC be adjacent angles sharing common arm BD and vertex B. The other arms are BA and BC. Since BA and BC form the overall angle ∠ABC, by definition, ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠DBC. A diagram would show point B with rays BA, BD, and BC, where BD splits ∠ABC into two smaller angles.",

Let the intersecting lines be AB and CD intersecting at point O, forming angles ∠AOD, ∠AOC, ∠BOC, and ∠BOD. By the vertical angles theorem, ∠AOD = ∠BOC and ∠AOC = ∠BOD. \nProof: \n1. Since line AB and CD intersect, the adjacent angles are supplementary (i.e., their measures add up to 180°). \n2. For instance, ∠AOD + ∠AOC = 180° and ∠AOC + ∠BOC = 180°. \n3.
