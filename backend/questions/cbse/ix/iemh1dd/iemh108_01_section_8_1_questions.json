    "correct_answer": "Proof: Let ABCD be a rhombus with all sides equal. Draw the diagonals AC and BD intersecting at O. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, by Theorem 8.6, the diagonals bisect each other: OA = OC and OB = OD. In triangles AOD and COD, we have: OA = OC (given), OD = OD (common), and AD = CD (sides of a rhombus are equal). Thus, by the SSS rule, ΔAOD ≅ ΔCOD. Therefore, ∠AOD = ∠COD. Since these two angles together form a straight line (sum equals 180°), each must be 90°. Hence, the diagonals are perpendicular.",
    "explanation": "The proof starts by noting that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other and each side is equal in length.

Given AD bisects ∠PAC, we get ∠DAC = ½(∠PAC) = ∠ACB. (ii) With ∠DAC = ∠BCA and CD ∥ AB, lines BC and AD are parallel (by alternate interior angles). Additionally, since BA ∥ CD by given, both pairs of opposite sides in quadrilateral ABCD are parallel, making it a parallelogram.",
    "explanation": "First, by using the exterior angle theorem and properties of an isosceles triangle, one can show that the bisector creates an angle equal to the base angle.
