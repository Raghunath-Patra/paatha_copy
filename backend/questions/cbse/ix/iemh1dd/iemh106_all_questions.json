    "explanation": "Construction and Reasoning:\n1. The line EF is perpendicular to CD, so the angle between EF and CD is 90°.\n2. At point E (on CD), ∠GED is given as 126°. Here, GED is the angle between the transversal GE and the line through E that lies along CD. Since EF ⟂ CD, the angle between GE and EF is the difference: 126° − 90° = 36°. Thus, ∠GEF = 36°.\n3. Now, since AB ∥ CD and GE is a transversal, the angle that GE makes with AB is equal to the angle it makes with CD. Thus, at the intersection of GE with AB (point G, by appropriate construction), the angle between GA (which lies along AB) and GE is 126°. Hence, ∠AGE = 126°.\n4. Finally, consider triangle GEF. The sum of the angles in triangle GEF is 180°. We have already found ∠GEF = 36° and by the construction from the parallel lines the angle at G (which, by alternate interior angles with the right angle at F, turns out to be 126°) is taken as ∠AGE. However, in triangle GEF the angle at G is actually the remaining angle between GF and GE. Thus, ∠FGE = 180° − (126° + 36°) = 18°.\nNote: The auxiliary construction involves extending GE to meet AB at G and using the fact that lines AB and CD are parallel.

Next, consider the transversal PR cutting the same parallel lines. At point R on CD, the angle ∠PRD is 127°.

Similarly, since ray OD stands on line AB, we have ∠AOD + ∠BOD = 180°. Equating these two sums gives: ∠AOC + ∠AOD = ∠AOD + ∠BOD. By subtracting ∠AOD from both sides, we obtain ∠AOC = ∠BOD.

    "correct_answer": "The converse of the Linear Pair Axiom states that if the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then their non-common arms lie on a line. The reasoning behind this is based on geometric constructions and by testing various configurations of adjacent angles. As a counter-example, consider adjacent angles that sum to less than 180° (for example, 60° and 30°); in this case, the non-common arms will not form a straight line because they open up to form an angle less than a straight angle. Thus, the condition that they sum to 180° is both necessary and sufficient for the non-common arms to be collinear.",
    "explanation": "The reasoning involves constructing various examples. Only when the two adjacent angles sum exactly to 180° do the non-common arms become collinear, confirming the converse. In any other case, such as when the angles sum to 90° or 140°, the arms do not lie on the same line. This logical deduction confirms the validity of the converse when its condition is met, and the failure of the collinearity when the condition is not met serves as the counter-example.",

Therefore, ∠AOC = ∠BOD = 40°.\nStep 2: The problem gives ∠AOC + ∠BOE = 70°.

In the diagram the rays usually occur in order. Observe that line AB and line CD form a pair of straight lines (each giving 180° at O). Using the fact that OB (a ray on line AB) and OC (a ray on line CD) form an angle of 180° − ∠AOC = 180° − 40° = 140° and that ∠BOE = 30° (the angle from OB to OE), the smaller angle between OC and OE is given by:\n  ∠(smaller COE) = 140° − 30° = 110°.\nStep 4: The reflex angle is the larger angle between the same rays, i.e.,\n  reflex ∠COE = 360° − 110° = 250°.\nThus, ∠BOE = 30° and the reflex angle ∠COE = 250°.",

Then, (∠QOS – ∠POS) = (180° − θ − θ) = 180° − 2θ, and half of this is 90° − θ, which equals ∠ROS (the angle between OR (at 90°) and OS (at θ)). Hence, ∠ROS = 1/2 (∠QOS – ∠POS).",
