    "correct_answer": "A linear equation in two variables has the general form ax + by + c = 0. This equation represents a line in the Cartesian plane provided that at least one of a or b is nonzero. The existence of solutions is guaranteed because for any x (or y) chosen, there exists a corresponding y (or x) value that satisfies the equation, leading to infinitely many solutions lying on a straight line.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Begin with the general equation ax + by + c = 0. Note that at least one of the coefficients, a or b, must be nonzero to avoid the trivial case.\nStep 2: If b ≠ 0, rewrite the equation as y = (-a/b)x - (c/b), showing that for every x, there exists a y computed by this formula, forming a straight line.\nStep 3: If b = 0 (and a ≠ 0), the equation reduces to x = -c/a, which is a vertical line. In this case, y can be any real number.\nStep 4: In both cases, the solution set is represented geometrically as all the points lying along a line in the Cartesian plane. This line is determined by its slope (if b ≠ 0) and its intercept, or is vertical if b = 0.\nThus, a linear equation in two variables always has infinitely many solutions, forming a line on the Cartesian plane.",
