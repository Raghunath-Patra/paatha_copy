    "correct_answer": "A point in the Cartesian plane is represented by an ordered pair (x, y), where the order signifies first the horizontal displacement (x-coordinate) and then the vertical displacement (y-coordinate). The uniqueness comes from the fact that the ordered pair specifies exactly one location. For example, (3, 4) means the point is 3 units from the y-axis and 4 units from the x-axis, while (4, 3) indicates 4 units from the y-axis and 3 units from the x-axis. Since the positions along the x- and y-axes are not interchangeable, (3, 4) and (4, 3) are different points.",
    "explanation": "To prove uniqueness, assume two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) represent the same location. Then by the definition of coordinates, x₁ must equal x₂ and y₁ must equal y₂. The ordered pair structure means that the sequence (x, y) matters. Therefore, (3, 4) ≠ (4, 3) because the first number represents the horizontal distance from the y-axis and the second represents the vertical distance from the x-axis.

A particular cross-street is made by two streets, one running in the North–South direction and another in the East–West direction. Each cross-street is referred to in the following manner: If the 2nd street running in the North–South direction and 5th in the East–West direction meet at some crossing, then we will call this cross-street (2, 5).

    "correct_answer": "The horizontal difference is |7 - 4| = 3 units and the vertical difference is |5 - 1| = 4 units. The Euclidean distance between the desks is √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5 units.",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Compute the differences: Horizontal: 7 - 4 = 3, Vertical: 5 - 1 = 4. Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem: distance = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5. Thus, the desks are 5 units apart.",
