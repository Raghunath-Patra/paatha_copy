    "question_text": "Look at the following activities and reason whether work is done in each case: Suma is swimming in a pond; a donkey is carrying a load on its back; a windmill is lifting water from a well; a green plant is performing photosynthesis; an engine is pulling a train; food grains are getting dried in the sun; and a sailboat is moving due to wind energy.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For Suma, work is done because her strokes apply force resulting in displacement of water. For the donkey, no work is done on the load in the strict scientific sense since the load is carried horizontally at constant velocity (although internal energy is expended). The windmill does work by lifting water (force applied upward causing displacement). In photosynthesis, no mechanical work is done. The engine does work on the train as it applies force causing displacement. Drying food grains in the sun does not involve mechanical work, and for the sailboat, work is done because the wind applies a force on the sail causing displacement.",
    "explanation": "In physics, work is defined as the product of force and displacement in the direction of the force. Each scenario is analyzed by checking if both conditions—a force acting and a corresponding displacement in that force’s direction—are met. For example, while muscular effort may be felt (as with the donkey or during swimming), only those activities where the force produces a displacement (as with the windmill, engine, or sailboat) are considered to have done work in the scientific sense.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the pendulum bob is drawn aside, work is done against gravity and the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy. Upon release, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the bob accelerates towards the lowest point. On the opposite side of the swing, the kinetic energy is reconverted into potential energy. This energy conversion continues, but gradually the mechanical energy is lost due to friction with the air and friction at the pivot, being transformed into heat. The bob comes to rest because the energy is eventually dissipated, not lost, thereby upholding the law of conservation of energy.",
    "explanation": "The pendulum provides a practical example of energy transformation. At the highest point, the energy is entirely gravitational potential energy. As the bob swings downward, potential energy decreases while kinetic energy increases (and vice versa as it rises). However, non-conservative forces like air resistance and pivot friction continually convert some of the mechanical energy into thermal energy, leading to a gradual loss in mechanical oscillations. Despite this, the total energy is conserved when accounting for all forms, including heat.",
