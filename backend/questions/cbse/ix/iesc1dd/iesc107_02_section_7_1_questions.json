    "correct_answer": "First, using the metre scale, measure the length L and width W of the court along its sides. Walk along one side to measure L, then along the adjacent side to measure W. The total distance covered is the sum L + W. Next, use the rope to represent the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points (the diagonal of the court) and use the Pythagoras theorem, calculating it as √(L² + W²), to determine the displacement.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The straight-line displacement is significantly lower than 1850 km because it represents the shortest distance between the two cities, calculated on a map, as opposed to the actual curved and winding roads taken. Factors include road detours, geographical obstacles, non-linear routes, and the necessity to follow existing infrastructures, all of which increase the distance measured by the odometer compared to the direct displacement.",
    "explanation": "Roads rarely follow a perfect straight line due to topographical and urban planning reasons. Hence, while an odometer records the total distance traveled along these twists and turns, the displacement obtained from a map shows the minimal direct distance possible, illustrating a key difference between path length and net change in position.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The reference point, or origin, is arbitrary and its selection can influence how we describe the position of an object. For example, describing the location of a school as '2 km north of the railway station' uses the station as the reference point. However, if one chooses the school as the origin, then the railway station's position would be described relative to the school, such as '2 km south.' The choice alters the coordinate values and can simplify or complicate the analysis depending on the problem's context.",
    "explanation": "By choosing different reference points, the same position can be visualized differently in coordinate systems. This decision is critical in physics problems to simplify calculations or match real-world interpretations.
