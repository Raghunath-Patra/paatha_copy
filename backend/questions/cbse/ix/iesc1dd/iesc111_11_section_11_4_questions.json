    "correct_answer": "The process begins when the microphone detects sound waves and converts them into electrical signals. These signals are then sent to the amplifier, which increases their strength. Finally, the amplified electrical signals are transmitted to the speaker, which converts them back into sound waves that are delivered to the user's ear.",
    "explanation": "A hearing aid comprises several components that work together: the microphone picks up sound and converts it into an electrical signal; the amplifier increases the amplitude of this electrical signal; and the speaker converts the amplified electrical signal back into sound. This process enables individuals with hearing loss to perceive sound more clearly.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "As people age, their sensitivity, particularly to higher frequencies, diminishes. Young children, under the age of five, can hear higher frequencies (up to about 25 kHz) compared to older adults. Similarly, some animals such as dogs and bats have extended hearing ranges that include ultrasonic or infrasonic sounds. This difference means that young children and certain animals may detect sounds that older adults cannot. For example, the detection of low-frequency infrasound preceding an earthquake might alert animals to danger before humans realize it.",
    "explanation": "Human hearing deteriorates with age, particularly for high-frequency sounds. Children generally have better high-frequency hearing compared to adults. Animals with broader or different auditory ranges can pick up sounds outside the human audible range, which can serve as early warning signals for natural events like earthquakes, potentially influencing their behavior and aiding in survival.",
