    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Naphthalene undergoes sublimation, meaning it changes directly from solid to gas without forming a liquid intermediate. (b) Perfume contains particles in the gaseous state that, due to their high kinetic energy and rapid diffusion, can be detected at several metres distance.",
    "explanation": "In (a), sublimation occurs when the particles of naphthalene gain enough energy to overcome intermolecular forces, moving directly into the gas phase. In (b), the volatile compounds in perfume evaporate and mix with air; their fast and random motion allows the scent to be carried over long distances.",

    "correct_answer": "Oxygen < Water < Sugar",
    "explanation": "Oxygen exists as a gas with weak intermolecular forces. Water, being a liquid, has moderately strong hydrogen bonds. Sugar, a crystalline solid, has a strong lattice with strong forces of attraction between its particles. This ordering reflects increasing strength of particle bonding.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) At 25°C, water is in the liquid state. (b) At 0°C, water exists in a state where both ice (solid) and liquid water can coexist at equilibrium. (c) At 100°C, water exists as a mixture of liquid and gas (steam) because the boiling process creates vapor bubbles within the liquid.",
    "explanation": "At room temperature (25°C), water remains liquid. At 0°C, under standard pressure, water reaches its melting/freezing point where both phases coexist. At 100°C, the boiling process initiates a phase change where liquid water coexists with water vapour.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(a) Water is a liquid at room temperature because it has a fixed volume but no fixed shape, it flows easily, and its particles are loosely arranged with significant intermolecular spaces allowing movement. (b) An iron almirah is a solid because it has a definite shape and volume, exhibits rigidity, and has particles that are tightly bound with negligible compressibility.",
    "explanation": "Water’s molecular structure leads to a liquid state: the particles are close enough to interact but move freely past each other, allowing for fluidity and adaptation to container shapes. In contrast, the strong metallic bonds in iron ensure that the particles maintain fixed positions, giving the material its rigid structure and characteristic solid properties.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ice at 273 K is more effective in cooling because, as it melts, it absorbs a significant amount of latent heat of fusion from the surroundings, which removes extra thermal energy that water at 273 K does not absorb.",
    "explanation": "Even though both ice and water might be at 273 K, the phase change from solid to liquid requires energy – the latent heat of fusion. This energy is drawn from the surroundings, thereby enhancing the cooling effect when ice melts, whereas water at the same temperature only absorbs heat to increase its temperature.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Steam produces more severe burns than boiling water because, in addition to its sensible heat, steam carries extra energy in the form of latent heat of vaporization that is released when it condenses on the skin.",
    "explanation": "When steam comes in contact with skin, it condenses into water—a process that releases the latent heat of vaporization. This additional heat energy increases the severity of the burn compared to boiling water at the same temperature, which only transfers its sensible heat.",

For making this model you will need a transparent jar, a big rubber balloon or piece of stretchable rubber sheet, a string, and a few chickpeas (or black gram/dry green peas). Explain the process of building the model and how it demonstrates the particle movement in different states of matter.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One possible model involves placing the seeds in a transparent jar. Then, attach a string to the center of a stretched rubber sheet (secured with tape) and cover the jar with the rubber sheet. By tugging the string slowly, the seeds will vibrate slightly to mimic the slight movements in a solid. Rapid tugging will cause the seeds to jump about more vigorously, simulating the freer movement of particles in a liquid or even a gas.",
    "explanation": "This model visually depicts the kinetic theory of matter. In a solid, the particles (seeds) only vibrate around fixed positions; in a liquid, they move past one another with greater freedom; and in a gas, they move rapidly and randomly. The experiment helps to bridge the gap between theoretical particle movement and observable phenomena, linking everyday observations (such as diffusion) to scientific principles.",
