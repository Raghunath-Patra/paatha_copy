    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sound is a form of energy that produces the sensation of hearing; it is produced by vibrating objects.",
    "explanation": "Sound is generated when an object vibrates, causing the particles in the surrounding medium (such as air) to oscillate. These oscillations propagate as mechanical waves which are detected by our ears.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a vibrating object (like a tuning fork) moves forward, it pushes air particles together, creating a region of high pressure (compression); when it moves back, it creates a region of low pressure (rarefaction). A diagram (similar to Fig. 11.4) would show consecutive regions of compressions and rarefactions along the direction of sound propagation.",
    "explanation": "A vibrating sound source displaces nearby air particles. As it moves forward, the particles are crowded together forming compressions. When it recoils, it leaves a gap causing rarefactions. These alternating regions illustrate how pressure variations form a longitudinal wave. The diagram should clearly label compressions (high pressure) and rarefactions (low pressure).",

    "question_text": "Why is a sound wave called a longitudinal wave?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sound waves are called longitudinal waves because the particles of the medium oscillate back and forth in the same direction as the wave propagates.",
    "explanation": "In a longitudinal wave, the particle displacement is parallel to the direction of wave propagation. In sound, the vibrations (or oscillations) of the medium's particles occur along the same direction as the movement of the wave, creating a series of compressions and rarefactions.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Because light travels at approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s while sound travels at around 340 m/s, the light reaches the observer almost instantly while the slower sound takes a few seconds to cover the same distance.",
    "explanation": "When lightning occurs, both light and sound are generated. However, due to the vast difference in their speeds, the lightning flash is seen almost immediately, whereas the sound of thunder, traveling much more slowly, reaches the observer with a perceptible delay.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "For 20 Hz, the wavelength λ = 344 m/s ÷ 20 Hz = 17.2 m; for 20 kHz, λ = 344 m/s ÷ 20000 Hz = 0.0172 m (approximately 1.72 cm).",
    "explanation": "Using the formula λ = v/ν, where v is the speed of sound and ν the frequency, we calculate the wavelength at the extremes of the human hearing range. A low-frequency sound (20 Hz) has a long wavelength (17.2 m), while a high-frequency sound (20 kHz) has a very short wavelength (0.0172 m).",

    "correct_answer": "Expressing the times as t_air = L/346 and t_aluminium = L/6420, the ratio t_air / t_aluminium = 6420/346 ≈ 18.56, meaning the sound in air takes approximately 18.6 times longer.",
    "explanation": "Given that the time taken for sound to travel a distance L is t = L/v, the ratio of times for air and aluminium is (L/346) / (L/6420) which simplifies to 6420/346 ≈ 18.56. This indicates that sound travels much faster in aluminium than in air.",

    "explanation": "Just like light, when sound waves hit a reflecting surface, they obey the law of reflection. The angle at which sound hits the surface (angle of incidence) equals the angle at which it bounces off (angle of reflection), assuming a smooth, large, reflecting surface.",

    "type": "Short Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "On a hotter day, the speed of sound increases, which may reduce the time delay between the original sound and its echo. If the delay becomes shorter than 0.1 s, a distinct echo might not be heard.",
    "explanation": "The propagation speed of sound increases with temperature. For distinct echoes to be heard, the time interval between the original sound and its reflection must be at least 0.1 seconds—the persistence time of sound in the brain. On hot days, even though the distance is unchanged, the sound returns faster, possibly making the echo indistinct.",

    "correct_answer": "The time taken for the stone to fall is t₁ = √(2*500/10) = 10 s, and the time for sound to travel back up is t₂ = 500/340 ≈ 1.47 s. Therefore, the total time is approximately 10 + 1.47 = 11.47 s.",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the free-fall time using s = ½gt², which gives t ≈ 10 s. Then, find the time for sound to travel upward by dividing the distance by the speed of sound, which is roughly 1.47 s. Adding both times gives the total elapsed time until the splash is heard.",

    "correct_answer": "First, convert 1.5 cm to meters (0.015 m). Then, using ν = v/λ, the frequency is 339 m/s ÷ 0.015 m = 22600 Hz. Since this frequency is above 20000 Hz, it is ultrasonic and not audible to most humans.",
    "explanation": "The formula ν = v/λ is used to determine the frequency. With the given speed and a converted wavelength of 0.015 m, the resulting frequency is approximately 22600 Hz. Human hearing typically ranges from 20 Hz to 20000 Hz, making this frequency inaudible.",

A defect, such as a crack, will cause the waves to reflect back earlier or in a different pattern than expected, which is then detected by sensors.",
    "explanation": "The technique involves directing ultrasonic waves into the metal. In areas where the material is uniform, the waves propagate normally. However, if there is a flaw, the change in density causes a portion of the waves to be reflected or scattered. The detectors capture these anomalies, thereby indicating the presence of a defect.",
