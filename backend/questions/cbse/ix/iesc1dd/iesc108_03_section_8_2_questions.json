    "correct_answer": "B. The coin’s inertia keeps it at rest as the card moves away.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Galileo observed that a marble rolls down an inclined plane and speeds up due to gravitational force, but when climbing up, it slows down. He deduced that in the absence of unbalanced forces, an object would maintain uniform motion (constant speed). In an ideal frictionless scenario, the marble would reach equal heights on the opposite side of a symmetrical inclined plane. However, in real conditions, frictional forces oppose the motion, eventually causing the marble to stop.",
    "explanation": "Galileo's inclined plane experiments illustrated that an object's motion will not change unless an external net force acts on it. This observation led to the understanding of inertia. The experiments also reveal how friction, though often neglected in theoretical discussions, plays a critical role in practical situations by dissipating energy and altering motion.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's First Law implies that a body in motion tends to stay in motion. During sudden braking, although the vehicle decelerates rapidly due to an external force, the passengers' bodies tend to continue at the original speed because of their inertia. Safety belts provide an additional force that restrains the passenger, slowing them down more evenly with the vehicle, and preventing injury. Similarly, in sharp turns, without a restraining force, a passenger's body would continue in a straight path, leading to displacement relative to the vehicle.",
    "explanation": "The law of inertia explains why occupants of a vehicle exhibit relative motion during abrupt maneuvers. Safety belts counteract this inertial tendency by exerting forces that match the deceleration or directional changes of the vehicle, thereby enhancing passenger safety.",
