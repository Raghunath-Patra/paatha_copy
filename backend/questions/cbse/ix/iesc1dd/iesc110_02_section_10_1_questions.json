    "correct_answer": "In everyday usage, 'work' often refers to any physical or mental effort (e.g., studying or cleaning) regardless of an object moving. In scientific terms, 'work' is only done when a force causes displacement in its own direction. For example, studying may be seen as hard work in daily life, while scientifically, no work is done since there is no physical displacement of a mass by an applied force.",
    "explanation": "Everyday language incorporates the notion of effort or energy use as work, whereas scientifically, the definition strictly requires both a force and a displacement in the direction of that force, making activities like reading not count as work.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Kamali engaging in study involves a lot of mental effort and energy expenditure; however, according to the scientific definition of work, no work is done because there is no significant displacement of an object in the direction of an applied force. In contrast, when climbing stairs, the body is moved upward against gravity, which means that a force (from the muscles) is causing a displacement. This satisfies the two conditions of work: a force is applied and there is displacement in the direction of that force, hence scientific work is performed.",
    "explanation": "This comparison hinges on the definition of work. In studying, while energy is used, the lack of physical displacement means that scientific work is zero. Climbing stairs results in actual displacement (vertical movement) which, combined with the force applied against gravity, meets the criteria for work.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Consider a spaceship in deep space moving at a constant velocity. Once it is set in motion by an initial force, it continues moving due to inertia after the net force becomes zero. Even though the spaceship is still moving (resulting in a displacement), since there is no longer an active force acting on it in the direction of this displacement (net force is zero), no additional work is done in its current state by that particular force. This illustrates that work is only done when a force is applied and causes displacement at that moment.",
    "explanation": "According to Newton’s first law, an object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Once in uniform motion (constant velocity), the net force is zero, so despite displacement occurring, no work is being done at that moment by the net force. This example highlights the distinction between displacement and work performed by an active force.",
