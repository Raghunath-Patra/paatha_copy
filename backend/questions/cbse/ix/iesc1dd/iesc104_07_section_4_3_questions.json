This principle affects the chemical reactivity, valence electron configuration, and periodic trends, as elements with similar outer electron configurations show similar chemical properties.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Bohr-Bury model simplifies the understanding of electron configurations by organizing electrons into discrete energy levels or shells. The model states that each shell can hold a maximum of 2n² electrons, which explains how electrons fill each shell in a step-wise manner, starting with n = 1. Furthermore, the outermost shell for atoms up to Argon (Ar) is restricted by the octet rule, which limits the number of electrons to 8. These principles combined provide a clear representation of how electrons are arranged in atoms, correlating to periodic trends and chemical reactivity observed in the first eighteen elements.",
    "explanation": "By using the 2n² formula and observing that electrons fill lower energy levels first, the Bohr-Bury model clarifies why elements show periodic behavior. The octet rule ensures that atoms tend toward a stable configuration with eight electrons in their valence shell, influencing their chemical properties and interactions.",

Materials required include cardboard or a foam board, circular templates or objects to trace circles, beads/stickers of two different colors (for inner electrons and valence electrons), and markers. The procedure involves: 1) Drawing concentric circles on the board to represent the K, L, M shells. 2) Labeling each circle with its corresponding maximum electron capacity using the 2n² rule. 3) Placing 1-2 beads on the first circle to represent electrons in the K-shell, 3-8 beads on the second for L-shell electrons, and ensuring that the outermost shell has no more than 8 beads according to the octet rule. 4) Discussing how filling proceeds from the inner to the outer shells and how this affects the chemical properties of the elements.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11, meaning it has 11 electrons. According to the electron filling order, the K-shell (n=1) is filled with 2 electrons and the L-shell (n=2) with 8 electrons, reaching their maximum capacities as per the 2n² rule. Only after these inner shells are completely filled does the filling of the M-shell (n=3) begin. Therefore, even though the M-shell can hold up to 18 electrons, sodium only places one electron there because the lower energy levels must be fully occupied first. This preserves the stability and minimizes the energy configuration of the atom.",
    "explanation": "The rule of filling inner shells before outer ones ensures that electrons occupy the lowest energy levels, resulting in a more stable atomic structure.

    "correct_answer": "The electron configuration pattern for elements H to Ar is determined by the filling of electron shells according to the 2n² rule and the octet rule. Elements are arranged in periods based on their electron configurations; each period corresponds to the filling of a particular electron shell. For example, elements in Group 1 (like Li and Na) each have one electron in their outermost shell, making them highly reactive and similar in chemical behavior. This pattern explains the vertical grouping in the periodic table, where elements with the same number of valence electrons exhibit similar chemical properties.",

This means that while inner shells follow the 2n² capacity, valence shells in these lighter elements adhere to the octet rule for stability.",
