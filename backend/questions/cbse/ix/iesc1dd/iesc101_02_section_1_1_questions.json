    "correct_answer": "Both experiments clearly show that matter is made up of discrete particles. Activity 1.1 reveals that when salt or sugar dissolves in water there is no significant change in volume, implying that the solute particles occupy the spaces between water molecules. Activity 1.2, through serial dilution, demonstrates that even a tiny amount of a substance (like potassium permanganate) contains such a vast number of tiny particles that they can impart color to a large quantity of water.",
    "explanation": "Activity 1.1 implies the existence of gaps or intermolecular spaces where solute particles can reside without altering the overall volume. Meanwhile, Activity 1.2 shows that the potency of a substance (its ability to color water) remains even after dilution, evidencing that each crystal consists of innumerable, extremely small particles. Together, these experiments robustly support the idea that matter is particulate in nature.",

    "correct_answer": "While Activity 1.1 is an effective introductory experiment that shows the unchanged water level after dissolution indicating particle packing into available spaces, it can be improved. Enhancements might include using precise volumetric instruments like burettes to measure any minute changes, incorporating a control experiment using a non-dissolving substance, and testing multiple solutes to generalize the findings.",
    "explanation": "The experimentâ€™s simplicity effectively aids conceptual understanding; however, improvements in measurement precision and experimental control would reduce errors and provide a more rigorous confirmation of the particulate nature of matter.
