    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Activity 2.4, two groups were given iron filings and sulphur powder. Group I mixed the substances physically by crushing, resulting in a heterogeneous mixture where the original properties of iron (magnetism) and sulphur (solubility in CS₂) were retained. In contrast, Group II heated the mixture, causing a chemical reaction that produced iron sulphide (FeS), a compound with a uniform composition and different properties (e.g., loss of magnetism and different reaction with acids). The experiment demonstrates that physical mixing does not change the inherent properties of components, while chemical reactions result in the formation of new substances with distinct characteristics.",
    "explanation": "This explanation emphasizes how physical mixtures retain the original properties of the elements because no new substances are formed, whereas chemical reactions combine elements into compounds that have new and uniform characteristics.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the iron and sulphur mixture is heated, a chemical reaction occurs resulting in the formation of iron sulphide (FeS), a compound. This compound exhibits properties that are wholly different from the original elements; for instance, the new substance is non-magnetic (even though iron is magnetic), does not dissolve in carbon disulphide (CS₂) like sulphur would, and reacts with acids to produce hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) gas, which smells unlike the hydrogen gas produced by iron reacting alone. These observations confirm that a new substance with a fixed composition has been formed, which is the key characteristic of a compound.",
    "explanation": "By analyzing the changes in physical properties such as texture, colour, magnetic response, and chemical reactivity (solubility and gas production), the experiment validates that a chemical reaction has taken place, leading to the formation of a compound instead of a mere mixture.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To differentiate between a homogeneous mixture and a compound, one can design an experiment based on the properties and methods of separation. First, take a known homogeneous mixture, such as a solution of salt in water, and a known compound such as water. Perform tests including boiling point determination, chemical reactivity, and physical separation methods. For the homogeneous mixture, physical methods like evaporation or crystallization should separate the salt from the water, and the physical properties (like boiling point) would vary based on concentration. For a compound, decomposition by applying energy or chemical reactions (e.g., electrolysis of water yielding hydrogen and oxygen) is required since the elements are chemically bonded. Observations such as uniformity in appearance, consistency in composition, and the need for chemical reactions to separate the components indicate that the substance is a compound.",
