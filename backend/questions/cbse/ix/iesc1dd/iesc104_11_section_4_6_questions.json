    "correct_answer": "Certain isotopes, such as those of cobalt, are used in cancer treatment due to their radioactive properties, which enable them to destroy cancer cells. Their chemical similarity ensures that they can be incorporated into biological systems in a manner similar to non-radioactive isotopes, thus targeting specific areas without altering normal chemical processes. This allows for precise treatment of cancerous tissues with minimal side effects.",
    "explanation": "Isotopes used in medical treatments are chosen for their ability to emit radiation that can damage or kill cancer cells. Because isotopes of the same element have nearly identical chemical behavior, they can substitute for their stable counterparts in biological molecules. This substitution facilitates targeted therapy, as the isotope is taken up in a similar fashion to the normal element, delivering therapeutic radiation directly to the tumor.",
