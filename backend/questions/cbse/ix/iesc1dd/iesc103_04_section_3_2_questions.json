    "correct_answer": "Relative atomic masses are determined using the laws of chemical combination. For example, in CO, experiments show that 3 g of carbon combine with 4 g of oxygen. Setting the atomic mass of carbon to a convenient value (like 12 in modern practice), oxygen's mass is scaled accordingly. This ratio, when normalized using a standard like 1/12 the mass of carbon-12, gives the relative atomic masses of the respective elements.",

Later, Berzelius suggested that these be derived from one or two letters of the element's name. Over time, names based on the discovery location or distinguishing features (like color) were replaced by standardized symbols. Today, IUPAC approves and regulates element names, symbols (with proper capitalization) and ensures consistency, including adopting symbols from Latin or Greek when necessary.",

    "correct_answer": "Relative atomic masses are determined using the laws governing chemical combination, particularly the law of constant proportions. By measuring the masses of elements that combine to form compounds (using reactions such as that of carbon with oxygen in CO), scientists derive ratios that reflect the relative masses of individual atoms. Initially, oxygen-based units were used because oxygen formed many compounds and resulted in near whole-number masses. However, to achieve wider acceptance and consistency, in 1961 carbon-12 was chosen as the standard, defining 1 u as 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. This provided a universal reference point for comparing atomic masses across all elements.",

    "correct_answer": "The analogy compares a fruit seller slicing a watermelon into equal parts to measure fruits in relative mass units with the method used to define atomic masses. Just as the seller uses 1/12 of the watermelon to create a standard unit for measuring other fruits, scientists use 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom as the standard atomic mass unit. This approach allows for all other atomic masses to be calculated as multiples or fractions of this stable, agreed-upon unit.",
