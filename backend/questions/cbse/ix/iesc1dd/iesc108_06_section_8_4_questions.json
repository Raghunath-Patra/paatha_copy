    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton's Second Law of Motion illustrates that force equals mass times acceleration (F = m × a). In high jump competitions, athletes fall onto cushioned beds or sand, which increases the time over which their momentum changes to zero, thereby decreasing the acceleration and reducing the impact force. Similarly, when a fielder catches a cricket ball, pulling the hands backward increases the duration of deceleration. By increasing Δt in the equation F = Δp/Δt, the force (Δp being the change in momentum) experienced by the athlete is reduced, thus minimizing injury risk.",
    "explanation": "Both examples highlight how increasing the time interval of momentum change reduces the required force. This is a direct consequence of the Second Law where force is inversely proportional to the time over which a given change in momentum occurs.",

    "correct_answer": "For m₁: m₁ = F/a₁ = 5 N/10 m/s² = 0.5 kg. For m₂: m₂ = F/a₂ = 5 N/20 m/s² = 0.25 kg. When tied together, the total mass m_total = 0.5 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg. The combined acceleration a = F/m_total = 5 N/0.75 kg ≈ 6.67 m/s². This demonstrates that as additional mass is added, the same force results in a lower acceleration, as predicted by F = m × a.",
    "explanation": "The answer involves calculating individual masses from the given force and acceleration, summing these masses, and then using Newton's Second Law on the combined mass. An increase in total mass, while the force remains constant, results in a reduction in acceleration.",
