Given that the speed of sound in air is about 346 m/s, the distance (d) is calculated using d = v × t. If t is measured in seconds, then no unit conversion is necessary. For example, for a delay of 3 seconds, d = 346 m/s × 3 s = 1038 m.",
    "explanation": "Lightning is seen almost instantly due to the high speed of light, while thunder, which travels slower (346 m/s), reaches the observer after a delay.
