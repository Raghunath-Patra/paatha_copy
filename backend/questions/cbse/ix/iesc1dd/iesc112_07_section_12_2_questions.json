    "correct_answer": "Animal husbandry plays a pivotal role in sustainable agriculture by optimizing the production of animal-based products while ensuring minimal environmental impact. Cross-breeding, for example, involves combining exotic breeds such as the Jersey, which have long lactation periods, with local breeds like the Sahiwal that are highly disease resistant. This practice produces offspring that not only have enhanced milk production but also greater overall hardiness, thereby reducing the reliance on antibiotics and chemical interventions. Such a strategy supports sustainable farming practices by promoting animal health, welfare, and efficient resource utilization.",
