    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experimental setup involves two identical pipes placed on a table near a wall. A sound source (like a clock or mobile phone in vibrating mode) is placed at the open end of one pipe, while the other pipe is used to receive the reflected sound. The experiment requires adjusting the pipes to align with the normal to the reflecting surface so that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. When aligned correctly, the sound is best heard through the receiving pipe. Lifting one of the pipes disrupts the alignment, demonstrating that the reflected wave must lie in the same plane as the incident wave and the normal. These observations confirm the law that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.",
    "explanation": "The experimental setup shows in a hands-on way how sound reflects following predictable geometric laws. The critical observation is that clear sound is received only when the setup maintains the correct plane and angle alignment, emphasizing the physical behavior of sound waves.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An echo is the reflection of sound that arrives at the listener some time after the direct sound. For an echo to be distinct, the time delay must be at least 0.1 s because the human brain retains the original sound for about 0.1 s. Therefore, if the echo arrives sooner, it overlaps with the original sound and is not distinctly heard. Using the speed of sound (e.g., 344 m/s at 22 ºC), this time delay translates into a minimum round-trip distance of about 34.4 m, hence a minimum one-way distance of 17.2 m. Temperature affects the speed of sound; as temperature increases, the speed increases, thereby altering the distances required for a distinct echo, meaning that at higher temperatures, the necessary minimum distance may become longer.",
    "explanation": "The explanation explores the interplay between sound wave propagation, human auditory perception, and environmental factors such as temperature. It emphasizes that both time and distance are critical parameters in the formation of a distinct echo.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Variations in ambient temperature affect the speed of sound; as temperature increases, sound travels faster. For example, if the speed of sound increases from 344 m/s at 22 ºC to 350 m/s at a higher temperature, the minimum total distance for a distinct echo (based on a 0.1 s delay) becomes 350 m/s × 0.1 s = 35 m, leading to a minimum one-way distance of 17.5 m (35 m/2). This shows that even small increases in temperature can require the reflecting surface to be slightly farther away for an echo to be distinctly heard.",
    "explanation": "Higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of air molecules, resulting in an increased speed of sound. This directly affects the distance calculations needed for echo formation, showing the importance of environmental factors on wave phenomena.",
