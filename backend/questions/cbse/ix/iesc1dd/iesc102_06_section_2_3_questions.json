    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The process of interconversion of water states involves melting (ice to water), evaporation (water to vapour), and condensation (vapour to water), as well as freezing (water to ice). During these transitions, the molecular structure of water (H₂O) remains unchanged, meaning that while the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) changes, the chemical composition does not. No new substances are formed, and the bonds between hydrogen and oxygen remain intact.",
    "explanation": "This process is purely a physical change because the energy input or removal only affects the molecular arrangement and not the actual chemical bonds that define water. The water molecules maintain the same chemical formula (H₂O) across all states.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Physical changes involve alterations in the state, form, or appearance of matter without changing its chemical identity, as seen in the melting of ice or evaporation of water that does not alter the H₂O molecules. In contrast, chemical changes involve reactions that lead to the formation of new chemical substances with different properties and compositions, such as the combustion of wax in a burning candle, where wax reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water vapor, and light. The burning of a candle illustrates both: the melting of the wax (physical change) and its combustion (chemical change).",
    "explanation": "By comparing these examples, we note that physical changes are usually reversible and do not involve new substances, whereas chemical changes are typically irreversible and lead to significant changes in composition. The processes involve distinct energy changes and bonding rearrangements.",
