    "correct_answer": "The demonstration shows that while the stone is being whirled, a centripetal force (provided by the tension in the thread) constantly pulls the stone toward the center of its circular path. When the thread is released, this force is no longer present; consequently, the stone flies off tangentially due to inertia.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Newton reasoned that just as an apple falls to the ground due to the gravitational pull of the Earth, the Moon must also be attracted towards the Earth. However, because the Moon has a significant horizontal velocity (inertia), it continually 'misses' the Earth and falls around it, resulting in an orbit. The inward gravitational force acting on the Moon serves as the centripetal force needed to keep it in its circular (or elliptical) path.",
    "explanation": "Newton's insight linked terrestrial gravity to celestial motions. He recognized that if a force acts to pull an object toward the Earth (as seen with a falling apple), then a similar force must be acting on the Moon. The Moon's inertial tendency to move in a straight line is constantly redirected by the Earth's gravitational pull towards the center, producing an orbit.",

A real-world example is the gravitational pull between the Earth and satellites: satellites in higher orbits experience a significantly weaker gravitational force than those in lower orbits.",
