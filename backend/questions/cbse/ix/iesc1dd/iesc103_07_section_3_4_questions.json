    "explanation": "Valency explains how atoms combine to form compounds by showing the number of electrons an atom can share, lose, or gain.

    "correct_answer": "The criss-cross method involves writing the symbols and valencies (or charges) of the constituent ions, then 'criss-crossing' the numbers to become the subscripts of the other ion. For example, to write the formula for carbon tetrachloride: carbon (valency 4) and chlorine (valency 1) are written. Criss-crossing the numbers gives CCl₄, where the 4 from carbon becomes the subscript for chlorine.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Valency is crucial because it determines how atoms bond by indicating the number of electrons an atom can share, lose, or gain in order to achieve a stable configuration. For simple ionic compounds like magnesium chloride (MgCl₂), the metal ion (Mg²⁺) bonds with two chloride ions (Cl⁻), balancing the charges. In compounds with polyatomic ions, such as calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) or ammonium sulphate ((NH₄)₂SO₄), the same principle applies but requires grouping of atoms (e.g., hydroxide or ammonium) into ion units. The use of brackets and correct subscripts becomes essential to accurately represent the number of polyatomic ions present.",
    "explanation": "Understanding valency provides the foundation for predicting the chemical formulas of compounds. It emphasizes that the overall charge of a compound must be zero, regardless of whether the bonding involves simple ions or more complex polyatomic ions. This concept is applied in everyday practices, such as predicting reactivity and formulating compounds in both industrial processes and laboratory experiments.",
