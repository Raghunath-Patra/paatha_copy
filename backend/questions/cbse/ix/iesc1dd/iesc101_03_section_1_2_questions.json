    "correct_answer": "Diffusion is the process by which particles intermingle as a result of their continuous random motion. In the experiments, a drop of ink spreads evenly in water rapidly, while honey diffuses much more slowly due to its higher viscosity and stronger intermolecular attractions.",

    "correct_answer": "In the experiment, the ink drop immediately spreads and colors the water uniformly, whereas the honey drop sinks and diffuses slowly. The difference is due to the lower viscosity and molecular size of the ink compared to the more viscous and larger molecules in honey.",
    "explanation": "Ink consists of smaller and less viscous molecules that move more freely in water, leading to a faster diffusion rate. On the other hand, the larger molecular structure and higher viscosity of honey hinder its movement, resulting in slower diffusion.",

    "correct_answer": "The experiment demonstrates that water molecules attract each other strongly, creating surface tension that resists being separated or 'cut' apart.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Continuous particle movement, which is quantified as kinetic energy, is fundamental to the process of diffusion. The experiments—whether the spreading aroma of an incense stick, the rapid dispersal of ink in water, or the faster color spread in hot water compared to cold water—demonstrate how increased kinetic energy accelerates the movement of particles. As particles move faster, they interact more frequently and spread more quickly throughout a medium, resulting in effective and uniform mixing.",
    "explanation": "The kinetic theory of matter explains that particles are always in motion. This continuous movement enables diffusion, with the rate directly linked to the kinetic energy of the particles. In the experiments, increased temperature (which raises kinetic energy) results in faster diffusion. This observation is critical in understanding many natural and industrial processes, from the mixing of substances in solutions to the behavior of gases in the atmosphere.",

Identify one real-world application for each state of matter based on your analysis.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiments demonstrate that the strength of intermolecular forces varies with the state of matter. The iron nail, which is difficult to break, shows that strong forces hold the particles in solids together. The human chain activity further illustrates that a tightly bound chain (locked arms) behaves like a solid, while loosely connected chains mimic the behavior of liquids (holding hands) and gases (finger-tip touch) where attractive forces are much weaker. A real-world application for solids is in construction materials such as steel beams, for liquids, the use of water in hydraulic systems, and for gases, the behavior of air in atmospheric processes and balloon inflation.",
    "explanation": "Stronger intermolecular forces in solids result in rigid structures with fixed particle positions, while liquids have moderate forces that allow flow, and gases have very weak forces enabling free movement. These differences account for many physical properties and practical applications, such as structural integrity in buildings (solids), fluid transport and machinery (liquids), and the compression and expansion in engines (gases).",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment is to prepare two identical transparent containers filled with the same amount of water. Add a drop of colored dye (like food coloring) along the side of each container. Place one container in a water bath at a higher temperature (e.g., 50°C) and keep the other at room temperature (approx. 25°C). The hypothesis is that the dye will diffuse faster in the warmer water due to increased kinetic energy of the water molecules. The procedure would include measuring the time it takes for the dye to evenly color the entire container. Expected observations include a quicker spread of the dye in the hot water compared to the cold water. The scientific explanation is based on kinetic molecular theory: higher temperatures provide particles with more energy, meaning they move faster and mix more rapidly, resulting in accelerated diffusion.",
    "explanation": "This experimental design allows clear comparisons between two controlled conditions, isolating temperature as the variable affecting diffusion. The use of color provides an immediate visual representation of the diffusion rate, and the measured time offers quantitative support for the hypothesis.",
