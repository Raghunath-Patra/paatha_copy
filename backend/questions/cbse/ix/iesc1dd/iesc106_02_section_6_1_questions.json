    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In plants, growth occurs primarily in specialized regions known as meristems, where cells are actively dividing. This leads to localized growth which then differentiates into various permanent tissues. In contrast, animals undergo a relatively uniform cell division throughout the body, resulting in an even, non-localized growth pattern. This difference influences their overall structure, with plants developing distinct zones for growth and support, while animals develop highly specialized organs throughout their bodies.",
    "explanation": "Plants fix their growth to localized meristematic tissues, allowing for continuous but region-specific expansion. Animals, due to their need for coordinated movement and metabolic activities across the entire body, distribute cell growth more uniformly. This adaptation reflects the evolutionary pressures exerted by their respective ways of life.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Plants are adapted to a stationary lifestyle, which is reflected in their tissue structures, especially the presence of supportive tissues composed of dead cells that allow them to maintain an upright form. They also possess specialized areas of cell division (meristems) that enable controlled, localized growth. Animals, on the other hand, have tissues predominantly made up of living cells that facilitate movement, rapid response to stimuli, and energy-intensive functions. Their uniform cell division supports the development of highly specialized and localized organs, which is essential for functions such as locomotion, feeding, and complex sensory processing. For example, the rigid supportive structures in plants are analogous to skeletal elements in animals, though the latter are living tissues.",
    "explanation": "The structural and functional differences between plant and animal tissues are direct responses to their ecological niches. Plants must withstand gravitational forces without movement, so they develop extensive supportive tissue. Animals, requiring flexibility and intricate organ systems for movement and survival, have evolved tissues that support these processes. The examples provided illustrate how physical structure is intricately linked to lifestyle.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Nutrient acquisition in plants and animals directly impacts their tissue composition and organization. Plants acquire nutrients primarily through photosynthesis and absorption from the soil, necessitating the development of specialized tissues such as supportive tissues for structural stability and meristematic tissues for localized growth. In contrast, animals often consume organic matter through ingestion, which requires tissues that facilitate digestion, rapid transport of nutrients, and high metabolic activity, leading to the development of complex, specialized organs such as the digestive tract, circulatory system, and muscle tissue. These differences illustrate how the mode of nutrient acquisition impacts not only the physical structures but also the functional organization of tissues within these organisms.",
    "explanation": "The contrasting nutrient acquisition strategies—photosynthesis and absorption in plants versus consumption in animals—have driven the evolution of distinct tissue types and organizational structures. Plants require tissues that offer mechanical support and localized growth to maximize light exposure, while animals develop highly specialized systems that support active metabolism and mobility.",
