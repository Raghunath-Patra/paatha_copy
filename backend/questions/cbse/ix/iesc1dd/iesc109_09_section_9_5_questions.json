    "correct_answer": "An object with a density lower than that of the fluid will float since it displaces sufficient fluid to generate a buoyant force greater than its weight. Conversely, if an object’s density is higher than that of the fluid, it will sink because the buoyant force is insufficient to overcome its weight.",
    "explanation": "The floating or sinking of an object is determined by comparing its density with that of the fluid. The principle is based on the fact that buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid, and an object will float when this force exceeds its weight.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Thrust is the force exerted perpendicular to a surface. Pressure is the thrust per unit area. For instance, a 5 kg wooden block exerts a thrust (weight) of approximately 49 N. When the block rests on a 20 cm × 10 cm face (0.02 m²), the pressure is 49 N divided by 0.02 m² (2450 Pa). However, when it rests on a 40 cm × 20 cm face (0.08 m²), the pressure is 49 N divided by 0.08 m² (612.5 Pa). This clearly demonstrates that for the same thrust, halving the area increases the pressure.",
    "explanation": "The example shows that pressure is inversely proportional to the area of contact. The same force distributed over a small area results in high pressure, while a larger area reduces the pressure.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The upward buoyant force, or upthrust, is the force exerted by a fluid on an immersed object, acting opposite to the force of gravity. In Activity 9.4, as an empty sealed bottle is pushed deeper into water, the displacement of water increases, and with it the buoyant force. The bottle rises when released because this upward force exceeds its weight. To keep the bottle submerged, an additional external downward force must be applied that counterbalances the net upthrust, ensuring that the sum of forces equals zero.",
    "explanation": "This explanation is based on the principle that the buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. For an object to remain submerged, the net force must be zero, which involves balancing the gravitational force with both the buoyant force and the externally applied force.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Understanding pressure is essential in various applications. For example, in civil engineering, building foundations are made wider to spread out the load and reduce pressure on the soil, thereby preventing structural damage. In the design of cutting tools, such as knives, a small contact area is preferred because it concentrates the applied force, resulting in higher pressure which allows for easier cutting. Both cases utilize the principle that pressure equals thrust divided by area.",
    "explanation": "These examples show how managing the distribution of force through control of the contact area can lead to safer and more effective designs. In foundations, reducing pressure minimizes soil compression; in cutting tools, increasing pressure enhances the tool’s effectiveness by ensuring the force is applied over a very small area.",
