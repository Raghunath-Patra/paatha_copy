    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Rutherford's experiment, a beam of fast-moving alpha particles (helium nuclei) was directed at a very thin sheet of gold foil, about 1000 atoms thick. The key steps involved firing these alpha particles at the foil and observing their deflection patterns. The majority of the particles passed straight through, which implied that the atom is mostly empty space. However, a few particles were deflected at small angles and an extremely small portion were deflected at very large angles or even rebounded, indicating that the positive charge and most of the mass were concentrated in a very small region. From these observations, Rutherford concluded that the atom contains a dense, positively charged nucleus at its center, with electrons orbiting around it.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Rutherford’s model, although groundbreaking, had a major drawback: it could not explain why electrons in a circular orbit around the nucleus do not radiate energy continuously despite undergoing acceleration. According to classical physics, accelerating charges emit electromagnetic radiation, so electrons should lose energy and spiral into the nucleus, leading to an unstable atom. Bohr resolved this by postulating that electrons move in fixed, discrete orbits (energy levels) where they do not emit energy while in these stable orbits. Electrons only emit or absorb energy when they transition between these quantized orbits. This assumption not only explained the stability of the atom but also accounted for the discrete emission spectra observed in experiments.",

    "correct_answer": "According to Bohr’s model, an atom consists of a small, dense nucleus containing nearly all its positive charge and mass, around which electrons orbit in fixed, circular paths known as energy levels or shells. These levels are quantized, meaning electrons can only occupy certain allowed orbits designated by quantum numbers (n = 1, 2, 3, ... or shells designated as K, L, M, etc.). While in these specific orbits, electrons do not emit energy. Energy is only emitted or absorbed when electrons jump from one energy level to another, resulting in the characteristic emission or absorption spectra of each element.",
