The closed system is vital because it prevents the escape of any gaseous reactants or products that could alter the total mass measurement.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Dalton's Atomic Theory posits that all matter is composed of small, indivisible particles called atoms, which combine in fixed, small whole number ratios to form compounds. This theory explains the Law of Conservation of Mass by stating that during a chemical reaction, atoms are neither created nor destroyed, only rearranged. It supports the Law of Constant Proportions by establishing that since atoms of a given element have identical mass and properties, compounds are formed with a constant ratio of these atoms, which results in definite proportions by mass.",
    "explanation": "Dalton’s theory provided the foundation for modern chemistry. Since atoms keep their identity through chemical reactions, the overall mass remains unchanged (Conservation of Mass). Moreover, the consistent combination ratios of atoms lead to compounds always having the same elemental composition (Definite Proportions), regardless of the reaction conditions or source of the compound.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Whole number ratios in Dalton's Atomic Theory indicate that atoms combine in fixed, small integer ratios to form compounds. This is significant because it explains why compounds have a specific and consistent composition, as seen in the Law of Constant Proportions. For example, water always has a mass ratio of 1:8 for hydrogen to oxygen because two hydrogen atoms combine with one oxygen atom in a fixed immutable ratio.",
    "explanation": "The whole number ratios ensure that the compounds are built from discrete units, making the mass and the types of atoms predictable and consistent. This provides a clear quantitative explanation for the observations in chemical reactions and supports the idea that matter is composed of indivisible atoms combining in specific proportions.",

    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment to test the Law of Constant Proportions involves analyzing a sample of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄·5H₂O). Steps include: 1) Weigh a precise sample of the compound. 2) Heat the sample to remove the five water molecules, and then weigh the anhydrous copper(II) sulfate. 3) Calculate the mass loss, which corresponds to the water. 4) Determine the ratio of copper, sulfur, oxygen, and water in the compound. Materials required are a balance, crucible, Bunsen burner, tongs, and a sample of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate. The expected outcome is that the ratios of the elements by mass remain constant, demonstrating that the compound always has the same proportions regardless of the sample size.",
    "explanation": "The experiment illustrates that the composition of copper(II) sulfate is fixed. Even when the sample is divided or used in different experiments, the mass ratios of copper, sulfur, oxygen, and water remain invariant, thus affirming the Law of Constant Proportions.",
