    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the tuning fork is struck against a rubber pad, it is set into rapid vibratory motion. These vibrations represent mechanical energy that is transferred into the surrounding air in the form of sound waves. The energy travels from the vibrating prongs to the air molecules, which then propagate the sound until they reach our ears. Additionally, these vibrations have enough energy to physically disturb nearby objects, such as pushing a suspended ball.",
    "explanation": "This answer explains how the initial mechanical energy (via striking) is converted into vibratory energy and then transferred to the surrounding medium. Understanding this process helps link the physical phenomenon to real-world sound production.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the vibrating tuning fork touches the water surface, the energy from its vibrations is transferred to the water molecules. This energy transfer creates small disturbances in the water, which then propagate as waves (ripples) outwards. This process of energy transmission from the vibrating object to the water illustrates the principle of wave formation due to mechanical disturbances.",
