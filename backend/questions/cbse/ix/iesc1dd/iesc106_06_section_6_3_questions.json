    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Blood functions as a connective tissue by serving as the medium that transports essential substances such as oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body. This is achieved through its components: red blood corpuscles (RBCs) which transport oxygen, white blood corpuscles (WBCs) which defend against pathogens, platelets which aid in blood clotting, and plasma, a fluid matrix that carries these cells along with dissolved proteins, salts, and hormones.",
    "explanation": "The role of blood as a connective tissue is pivotal because it links different parts of the body through circulation. The fluid nature of plasma allows rapid transport, while each cellular component plays a specialized role to maintain homeostasis and defense.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Skeletal (striated) muscle fibers are long, cylindrical, multinucleate, show alternate light and dark bands (striations), and are under voluntary control, primarily attached to bones to facilitate movement. Smooth muscles are spindle-shaped, uninucleate, lack striations, and function involuntarily in the walls of organs such as the intestines and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle cells are cylindrical, branched, uninucleate, show striations, and operate involuntarily to pump blood by rhythmic contractions of the heart.",
    "explanation": "The three muscle types differ significantly: skeletal muscles enable deliberate movements, smooth muscles regulate internal functions such as peristalsis and blood flow, and cardiac muscles maintain continuous heart function. Their structural differences, including cell shape and nucleus arrangement, closely relate to their specific functions and control mechanisms.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The structure of epithelial tissues is intricately related to their specific functions. For instance, the lung alveoli are lined by simple squamous epithelium, which is thin enough to facilitate rapid gas exchange. In contrast, the gastrointestinal tract is lined with tall columnar epithelium, often with microvilli, to increase surface area for absorption and secretion of digestive enzymes. The skin is composed of stratified squamous epithelium that provides multiple layers of protection against physical and chemical damage. This diversity in structure—ranging from a single thin layer to multiple dense layers—allows each epithelial tissue to effectively perform its role in protection, absorption, secretion, and filtration.",
    "explanation": "The epithelial tissue’s structure is adapted to its function: thin tissues allow rapid diffusion (as in the alveoli), while multiple layers provide robust protection (as in the skin). The gastrointestinal epithelium’s tall cells help in increasing the absorptive area, demonstrating a clear structure–function link.",
