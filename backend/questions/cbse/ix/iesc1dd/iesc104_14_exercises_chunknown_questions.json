    "correct_answer": "Rutherford’s model is unable to explain the stability of electron orbits. According to classical physics, electrons in circular orbits should radiate energy due to acceleration, causing them to spiral into the nucleus, which does not happen in reality.",

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with identical atomic numbers but different mass numbers (e.g., ¹²C and ¹⁴C). Isobars are atoms of different elements that have the same mass number but different atomic numbers (e.g., ⁴⁰Ar and ⁴⁰Ca). Isotopes have practical applications such as using uranium isotopes for nuclear fuel and cobalt isotopes for treating cancer.",
