    "correct_answer": "Molecular mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule and is used typically for covalent compounds. For example, water (H₂O) has a molecular mass of 18 u. On the other hand, formula unit mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in the simplest formula unit of an ionic compound, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), which has a formula unit mass of 58.5 u. While both calculations are performed in a similar manner, the term 'molecular mass' is reserved for discrete molecules, whereas 'formula unit mass' applies to compounds that do not exist as individual molecules but as a repeating ionic lattice.",

    "correct_answer": "The activity involves a hands-on laboratory simulation where students are provided with element cards that list atomic masses and various compound cards (both covalent and ionic compounds). Materials include printed atomic mass cards, compound formula cards, calculators, and worksheets. The instructor begins by explaining the concepts, and then divides the class into small groups. Each group selects a compound, identifies each element in turn, multiplies the atomic mass by the number of atoms indicated, and sums up these values to obtain the molecular or formula unit mass accordingly. For covalent compounds like H₂O, they calculate the molecular mass, while for ionic compounds like CaCl₂, they calculate the formula unit mass. Expected learning outcomes are that students will be able to distinguish between molecular mass and formula unit mass, perform calculations accurately, and demonstrate an understanding of ionic versus covalent compounds.",
