    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Plant cells have a cell wall made of cellulose, fixed and regular shape, large central vacuole, presence of chloroplasts and dictyosomes, and usually lack centrioles and have rare lysosomes, whereas animal cells lack a cell wall, have an irregular shape, possess small temporary vacuoles (if present), do not contain chloroplasts, have centrioles and commonly contain lysosomes.",
    "explanation": "Plant cells are characterized by additional structures such as the cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole that animal cells lack. The cell wall gives plant cells a fixed rectangular shape, while animal cells have an amorphous shape. These differences are aligned with the specialized functions each cell type carries out, such as photosynthesis in plants and diverse functions in animal tissues.",

    "question_text": "How is a prokaryotic cell different from a eukaryotic cell?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Prokaryotic cells are generally smaller (1–10 µm), lack a true nucleus (their genetic material is in a nucleoid region), have a single circular chromosome, and do not possess membrane-bound organelles, though they do have 70S ribosomes. In contrast, eukaryotic cells are larger (5–100 µm), contain a true nucleus enclosed by a membrane with multiple linear chromosomes, and have various membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. Ribosomes in the cytoplasm and rough ER are 80S (but 70S ribosomes are also found in mitochondria and chloroplasts).",
    "explanation": "This differentiation highlights key structural and functional distinctions. The absence of a nucleus and internal organelles in prokaryotes limits compartmentalization, whereas eukaryotic cells use compartmentalization to efficiently perform complex functions. Furthermore, the differences in ribosomal structure and chromosome organization are critical for their respective cellular processes and are a cornerstone of cell biology.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "If the plasma membrane ruptures, cell contents would leak out, the regulated transport of substances would be lost, and the cell would die.",
    "explanation": "The plasma membrane functions as a selectively permeable barrier that maintains the internal environment of the cell. Its rupture disrupts homeostasis, leading to uncontrolled leakage of ions and molecules, which quickly results in cell death.",

    "correct_answer": "Without the Golgi apparatus, the packaging, modification, and transport of proteins and lipids would be severely impaired. This would affect the formation of lysosomes and secretion processes, ultimately disrupting cellular function and likely causing the cell to die.",
    "explanation": "The Golgi apparatus plays a critical role in processing and sorting macromolecules necessary for cellular functions. Its absence disrupts the proper trafficking and maturation of essential proteins and lipids, compromising vital metabolic and secretory pathways.",

    "correct_answer": "Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of ATP through cellular respiration.",
    "explanation": "Mitochondria contain enzymes and a double membrane system that facilitate the process of oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for ATP production.

    "correct_answer": "An Amoeba obtains its food through endocytosis, specifically by extending pseudopods to surround and engulf food particles, forming food vacuoles in the process.",
    "explanation": "Endocytosis in Amoeba, often referred to as phagocytosis when ingesting larger particles, is a process where the cell membrane engulfs food material. The formed food vacuole then fuses with lysosomes for digestion. This mechanism is essential for nutrient uptake and survival in unicellular organisms.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Osmosis is the movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of higher water concentration to an area of lower water concentration.",
    "explanation": "Osmosis is a type of passive transport that does not require energy. It is driven by differences in solute concentration on either side of a membrane, resulting in net movement of water until equilibrium is reached. This process is vital for maintaining cell turgidity and fluid balance.",

    "question_text": "Carry out the following osmosis experiment: Take four peeled potato halves and scoos each one out to make potato cups. One of these potato cups should be made from a boiled potato. Put each potato cup in a trough containing water. Now, (a) Keep cup A empty; (b) Put one teaspoon sugar in cup B; (c) Put one teaspoon salt in cup C; (d) Put one teaspoon sugar in the boiled potato cup D. Keep these for two hours. Then observe the four potato cups and answer the following: (i) Explain why water gathers in the hollowed portion of cups B and C. (ii) Why is potato cup A necessary for this experiment? (iii) Explain why water does not gather in the hollowed-out portions of cups A and D.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "(i) Water gathers in cups B and C because the solutions in those cups are hypertonic relative to the potato cells; the high solute concentration causes water to move into the potato cells by osmosis, accumulating in the hollowed portion. (ii) Cup A serves as a control to show that in the absence of an osmotic gradient, there is no significant movement of water into the potato cells. (iii) In cup A, without any added solute, there is no osmotic gradient to drive water accumulation. In cup D, the boiled potato cells have lost the integrity of their selectively permeable membranes, so osmosis cannot occur effectively.",
    "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates osmotic principles. In a hypertonic solution (cups B and C), the external solute concentration is higher than that inside the cell, drawing water into the cells and causing the cavity to fill. The control (cup A) confirms that without a solute gradient, water movement is minimal. In the boiled potato (cup D), the destruction of cell membranes due to heat prevents osmosis, showing that the integrity of the cell membrane is crucial for selective transport.",
