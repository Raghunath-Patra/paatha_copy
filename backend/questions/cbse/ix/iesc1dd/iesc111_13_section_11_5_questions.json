    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An ultrasound scanner emits high-frequency ultrasonic waves that travel through the body and encounter tissues. At boundaries where there is a change in tissue density, some of the waves are reflected back. These reflected waves are captured by detectors, converted into electrical signals, and processed to build a visual representation of the organ. The image displays variations corresponding to different tissue types and structures.",
    "explanation": "The process begins with wave emission, followed by interaction with body tissues. Reflection occurs at interfaces with different densities. Electrical conversion and processing of the reflected signals then create a diagnostic image. This method allows non-invasive imaging of internal organs, aiding in detecting abnormalities.",

Limitations may include the potential for damage to very delicate parts, the need for specialized cleaning solutions, and the cost of ultrasonic equipment.",
    "explanation": "Ultrasonic cleaning offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and thoroughness due to cavitation. However, one must evaluate its suitability for different materials and components, considering that high-frequency vibrations might not be appropriate for fragile items.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ultrasound is used to break kidney stones by directing high-frequency waves at the stones, causing them to vibrate and fracture into smaller pieces. These small fragments can then be eliminated naturally through urine. The mechanism relies on the mechanical energy of the ultrasound waves generating stress within the stone material, leading to its disintegration.",
    "explanation": "The procedure utilizes focused ultrasonic energy to induce vibrations. The resultant stress surpasses the structural integrity of the stone, causing it to fragment. This non-invasive method is effective and minimizes injury to surrounding tissues, making it a preferred treatment in some cases.",
