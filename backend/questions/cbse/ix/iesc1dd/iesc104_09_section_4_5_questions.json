    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, directly determines its position in the periodic table. Each element has a unique atomic number, which means no two different elements can have the same number of protons. For instance, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, meaning it has one proton, while carbon has an atomic number of 6, meaning it has six protons. This uniqueness helps in organizing the periodic table; elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, which in turn correlates with recurring chemical properties.",
    "explanation": "The unique atomic number is fundamental to the identity of an element. It explains why hydrogen (Z = 1) is the simplest element, and why carbon (Z = 6) has different chemical characteristics. The periodic arrangement based on atomic numbers showcases recurring trends and helps predict chemical behavior.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. Isotopes are forms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers. For example, carbon has two stable isotopes: Carbon-12 and Carbon-13. Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, giving it a mass number of 12, while Carbon-13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons, resulting in a mass number of 13. The difference in mass number directly affects their physical properties and behavior in processes such as nuclear reactions and mass spectrometry.",
    "explanation": "While isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties (because they have the same number of protons and electrons), the difference in neutron number (and thus mass number) can influence their nuclear stability and reaction rates. This concept is crucial in fields like radiometric dating and nuclear medicine.",
