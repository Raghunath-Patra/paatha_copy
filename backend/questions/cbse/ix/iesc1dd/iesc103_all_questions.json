    "correct_answer": "Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. In compounds containing metals and non-metals, metal atoms typically lose electrons to form positively charged cations, while non-metal atoms gain electrons to form negatively charged anions. For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium becomes Na⁺ and chlorine becomes Cl⁻. Additionally, groups of atoms that behave as a unit and carry a net charge are known as polyatomic ions (e.g., sulfate SO₄²⁻). Monoatomic ions consist of single atoms (e.g., Na⁺ or Cl⁻), while polyatomic ions are aggregates of atoms bonded together that exhibit an overall charge.",

    "correct_answer": "Relative atomic masses are determined using the laws of chemical combination. For example, in CO, experiments show that 3 g of carbon combine with 4 g of oxygen. Setting the atomic mass of carbon to a convenient value (like 12 in modern practice), oxygen's mass is scaled accordingly.

By measuring the masses of elements that combine to form compounds (using reactions such as that of carbon with oxygen in CO), scientists derive ratios that reflect the relative masses of individual atoms. Initially, oxygen-based units were used because oxygen formed many compounds and resulted in near whole-number masses. However, to achieve wider acceptance and consistency, in 1961 carbon-12 was chosen as the standard, defining 1 u as 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

    "correct_answer": "To determine the molecular mass of a compound, follow these steps: (1) Identify each element in the compound along with the number of atoms present, (2) Obtain the atomic mass (in u) of each element, (3) Multiply the atomic mass of each element by the number of its atoms, and (4) Sum up these values to get the molecular mass. For water (H₂O), there are 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. Using the atomic masses (H = 1 u and O = 16 u), the molecular mass is calculated as (2 × 1) + (1 × 16) = 2 + 16 = 18 u.",

    "correct_answer": "Molecular mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule and is used typically for covalent compounds. For example, water (H₂O) has a molecular mass of 18 u. On the other hand, formula unit mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in the simplest formula unit of an ionic compound, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), which has a formula unit mass of 58.5 u. While both calculations are performed in a similar manner, the term 'molecular mass' is reserved for discrete molecules, whereas 'formula unit mass' applies to compounds that do not exist as individual molecules but as a repeating ionic lattice.",

    "correct_answer": "The activity involves a hands-on laboratory simulation where students are provided with element cards that list atomic masses and various compound cards (both covalent and ionic compounds). Materials include printed atomic mass cards, compound formula cards, calculators, and worksheets. The instructor begins by explaining the concepts, and then divides the class into small groups. Each group selects a compound, identifies each element in turn, multiplies the atomic mass by the number of atoms indicated, and sums up these values to obtain the molecular or formula unit mass accordingly. For covalent compounds like H₂O, they calculate the molecular mass, while for ionic compounds like CaCl₂, they calculate the formula unit mass. Expected learning outcomes are that students will be able to distinguish between molecular mass and formula unit mass, perform calculations accurately, and demonstrate an understanding of ionic versus covalent compounds.",
    "explanation": "This activity encourages collaborative problem solving, hands-on engagement, and reinforces the conceptual differences between molecular and formula unit mass in a structured, interactive environment.",
