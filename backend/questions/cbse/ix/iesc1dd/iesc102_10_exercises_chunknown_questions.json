    "correct_answer": "a) Evaporation, b) Sublimation, c) Filtration (or magnetic separation if applicable), d) Chromatography, e) Centrifugation, f) Separating funnel or Decantation, g) Filtration, h) Magnetic separation, i) Winnowing or Sieving, j) Decantation followed by Filtration or Centrifugation.",
    "explanation": "For each part a specific separation method is applied based on the physical properties of the mixture components. For example, sodium chloride can be recovered by evaporating water, and ammonium chloride sublimates on heating. Metallic particles can be separated by exploiting their magnetic property or simple filtration depending on the medium. Chromatography is ideal for separating pigments because it utilizes differences in solubility and migration.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Steps: 1. Take water (the solvent) in a pan and heat it. 2. Add sugar (a soluble solute) and tea leaves (which are partially soluble/insoluble) to the water. 3. Allow the sugar to dissolve completely, forming a solution with the water and sugar, while the tea components diffuse to impart colour and flavour. 4. Optionally add milk to form a colloidal solution. 5. Boil for desired time. 6. Filter the mixture using a strainer to separate the tea solution (filtrate) from the tea leaves (residue).",
    "explanation": "The process involves recognizing that water acts as the solvent in which sugar (solute) dissolves, forming a solution. Tea leaves do not entirely dissolve; they create an insoluble fraction that can be separated by filtration. This procedure maps real‐life applications of physical separation techniques.",

    "question_text": "Pragya tested the solubility of four salts at different temperatures. (a) What mass of potassium nitrate is needed to produce a saturated solution in 50 g of water at 313 K? (b) If a saturated solution of potassium chloride is prepared at 353 K and then cooled to room temperature, what would be observed? Explain. (c) Given the solubilities at 293 K: Potassium nitrate – 32 g, Sodium chloride – 36 g, Potassium chloride – 35 g, Ammonium chloride – 37 g, which salt has the highest solubility? (d) What is the effect of change in temperature on the solubility of a salt?",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "a) At 313 K, 62 g of KNO₃ dissolves in 100 g of water, so in 50 g water, (62/100)*50 = 31 g of KNO₃ is needed. b) As the solution cools, the solubility of KCl decreases, leading to crystallization of excess KCl. c) At 293 K, ammonium chloride (37 g) has the highest solubility compared to potassium nitrate (32 g), sodium chloride (36 g), and potassium chloride (35 g). d) Typically, the solubility of most solid salts increases with an increase in temperature; however, some salts like NaCl show minimal change.",
    "explanation": "This question applies solubility data to quantitatively determine the amount of solute needed for saturation and to qualitatively predict changes on cooling. Cooling a saturated solution often results in crystallization because of lower solubility at reduced temperatures. The comparison of solubilities at 293 K identifies the salt with the highest solubility based on the data provided.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "a) Saturated solution: A solution in which no more solute can dissolve at a given temperature; e.g., sugar in water when no further sugar dissolves. b) Pure substance: Matter with a fixed composition and distinct properties; e.g., water (H₂O) or gold (Au). c) Colloid: A heterogeneous mixture with intermediate particle size that scatters light (Tyndall effect) but appears uniform; e.g., milk or fog. d) Suspension: A heterogeneous mixture with large particles that settle on standing and can be separated by filtration; e.g., muddy water or chalk particles in water.",
    "explanation": "Each term is defined in terms of its composition and physical behavior. A saturated solution indicates the limit of solubility at a given temperature. Pure substances have a uniform and fixed composition. Colloids exhibit the Tyndall effect due to light scattering by particles, and suspensions are characterized by visible particles that settle over time.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A design could involve layering materials inside an earthen pot: first add a layer of coarse pebbles at the bottom to serve as the support and initial filter, followed by a layer of smaller pebbles. Next, add a layer of coarse sand and finish with a top layer of fine sand. Pour muddy water slowly onto the top layer; as it percolates through the layers, the larger particles will be trapped, and the filtered, cleaner water will collect at the bottom, which can be collected through a small opening or by using the pot's porous structure.",
    "explanation": "This design mimics natural filtration processes where sediment, sand, and rocks remove impurities from water.
