    "correct_answer": "The first 18 elements are arranged with electrons in various shells following the Bohr-Bury scheme. For example, hydrogen has one electron (valency 1) while helium has a complete first shell (valency 0). Lithium, with an electron configuration of 2, 1, is eager to lose one electron; whereas, neon, with a configuration of 2, 8, is chemically inert (valency 0). In elements like oxygen (2, 6) and fluorine (2, 7), the electrons are close to the complete octet, so they tend to gain electrons to achieve stability, resulting in valencies of 2 and 1 respectively. Thus, the electron distribution directly influences how readily an element reacts, with incomplete outer shells driving chemical interactions toward achieving a full octet.",
    "explanation": "The chemical reactivity is tied to the ability of an atom to achieve a more stable electron configuration. Atoms with incomplete outer shells (non-octets) react by losing, gaining, or sharing electrons to complete their octets, which is reflected in their valency.",

In covalent bonding, atoms share electrons. For example, two oxygen atoms each share two electrons to form O₂, achieving a full octet through shared electrons. Therefore, the type of bonding depends on the tendency of the elements to lose, gain, or share electrons in order to obey the octet rule.",

    "correct_answer": "The table shows that elements with very few electrons in their outermost shell (like hydrogen, lithium, or sodium) tend to lose electrons to reach a stable noble gas configuration, hence they have low valencies corresponding to the number of electrons lost. In contrast, elements with nearly full outer shells (like oxygen or fluorine) tend to gain electrons to complete the octet, resulting in relatively low valencies determined by 8 minus the number of outer electrons. Elements with intermediate numbers, such as boron or nitrogen, may share electrons through covalent bonding to complete their octets. The decision to lose, gain, or share electrons is strongly influenced by the energy cost of removing electrons versus the energy gained by forming a complete octet, which explains the observed trends in chemical reactivity and valency.",
    "explanation": "The electron configuration of an element is the deciding factor in its chemical behavior. Atoms will adopt the electron exchange mechanism (losing, gaining, or sharing) that requires the least energy while leading to a stable configuration.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The step-wise filling of electron shells means that electrons occupy the lowest available energy level first before moving to a higher level. This ensures that inner shells are completely filled before electrons populate the outer shells. This principle affects the chemical reactivity, valence electron configuration, and periodic trends, as elements with similar outer electron configurations show similar chemical properties.",
    "explanation": "This rule, inherent in atomic structure models, explains how electron occupancy leads to periodicity—that is, elements in the same group typically have similar chemical behavior due to having the same number of valence (outer shell) electrons.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The Bohr-Bury model simplifies the understanding of electron configurations by organizing electrons into discrete energy levels or shells. The model states that each shell can hold a maximum of 2n² electrons, which explains how electrons fill each shell in a step-wise manner, starting with n = 1. Furthermore, the outermost shell for atoms up to Argon (Ar) is restricted by the octet rule, which limits the number of electrons to 8. These principles combined provide a clear representation of how electrons are arranged in atoms, correlating to periodic trends and chemical reactivity observed in the first eighteen elements.",
    "explanation": "By using the 2n² formula and observing that electrons fill lower energy levels first, the Bohr-Bury model clarifies why elements show periodic behavior.

    "correct_answer": "Sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11, meaning it has 11 electrons. According to the electron filling order, the K-shell (n=1) is filled with 2 electrons and the L-shell (n=2) with 8 electrons, reaching their maximum capacities as per the 2n² rule. Only after these inner shells are completely filled does the filling of the M-shell (n=3) begin. Therefore, even though the M-shell can hold up to 18 electrons, sodium only places one electron there because the lower energy levels must be fully occupied first. This preserves the stability and minimizes the energy configuration of the atom.",

    "correct_answer": "The electron configuration pattern for elements H to Ar is determined by the filling of electron shells according to the 2n² rule and the octet rule. Elements are arranged in periods based on their electron configurations; each period corresponds to the filling of a particular electron shell. For example, elements in Group 1 (like Li and Na) each have one electron in their outermost shell, making them highly reactive and similar in chemical behavior. This pattern explains the vertical grouping in the periodic table, where elements with the same number of valence electrons exhibit similar chemical properties.",

However, the exact deflection angles and the fraction of α-particles deflected or rebounding would vary depending on the nuclear charge and mass of the metal, with heavier nuclei causing greater deflection due to stronger Coulombic repulsion.",
    "explanation": "The α-particle scattering experiment relies on the repulsive interaction between the positively charged nucleus and the α-particles. While gold was chosen for its thin foil properties and high atomic number, using another metal would still reveal a small, dense nucleus. Variations in deflection angles and counts occur because different metals have different nuclear charges and masses. For instance, a metal with a higher nuclear charge can cause more pronounced deflections of the α-particles.",

    "correct_answer": "The atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, directly determines its position in the periodic table. Each element has a unique atomic number, which means no two different elements can have the same number of protons. For instance, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, meaning it has one proton, while carbon has an atomic number of 6, meaning it has six protons. This uniqueness helps in organizing the periodic table; elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, which in turn correlates with recurring chemical properties.",
    "explanation": "The unique atomic number is fundamental to the identity of an element.

    "correct_answer": "The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. Isotopes are forms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers. For example, carbon has two stable isotopes: Carbon-12 and Carbon-13. Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, giving it a mass number of 12, while Carbon-13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons, resulting in a mass number of 13. The difference in mass number directly affects their physical properties and behavior in processes such as nuclear reactions and mass spectrometry.",

The majority of the particles passed straight through, which implied that the atom is mostly empty space. However, a few particles were deflected at small angles and an extremely small portion were deflected at very large angles or even rebounded, indicating that the positive charge and most of the mass were concentrated in a very small region.

According to classical physics, accelerating charges emit electromagnetic radiation, so electrons should lose energy and spiral into the nucleus, leading to an unstable atom. Bohr resolved this by postulating that electrons move in fixed, discrete orbits (energy levels) where they do not emit energy while in these stable orbits. Electrons only emit or absorb energy when they transition between these quantized orbits. This assumption not only explained the stability of the atom but also accounted for the discrete emission spectra observed in experiments.",
