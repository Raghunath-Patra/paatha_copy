    "correct_answer": "Canal rays are positively charged radiations discovered by E. Goldstein in a gas discharge tube, whose observation eventually led to identifying the proton.",
    "explanation": "Canal rays were observed in gas discharge experiments through narrow channels in the electrodes. Their positive charge indicated the existence of a subatomic particle carrying a positive charge, later named the proton. This discovery was fundamental in understanding that atoms contain charged particles that determine their properties and behavior.",

    "question_text": "If an atom contains one electron and one proton, will it carry any charge or not?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "No, the atom will not carry any net charge because the negative charge of the electron (-1) is exactly balanced by the positive charge of the proton (+1).",
    "explanation": "In an atom where there is one electron and one proton, the magnitude of the negative and positive charges are equal and opposite. As a result, the charges cancel each other out, rendering the atom electrically neutral. This principle underscores the basic concept of charge balance in atoms.",
