Initial kinetic energy = ½ × 1500 kg × (25/3 m/s)² and final kinetic energy = ½ × 1500 kg × (50/3 m/s)². Calculations yield initial KE ≈ 156250/3 J and final KE ≈ 625000/3 J.

The windmill does work by lifting water (force applied upward causing displacement). In photosynthesis, no mechanical work is done.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the pendulum bob is drawn aside, work is done against gravity and the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy. Upon release, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the bob accelerates towards the lowest point. On the opposite side of the swing, the kinetic energy is reconverted into potential energy. This energy conversion continues, but gradually the mechanical energy is lost due to friction with the air and friction at the pivot, being transformed into heat. The bob comes to rest because the energy is eventually dissipated, not lost, thereby upholding the law of conservation of energy.",
    "explanation": "The pendulum provides a practical example of energy transformation. At the highest point, the energy is entirely gravitational potential energy. As the bob swings downward, potential energy decreases while kinetic energy increases (and vice versa as it rises). However, non-conservative forces like air resistance and pivot friction continually convert some of the mechanical energy into thermal energy, leading to a gradual loss in mechanical oscillations. Despite this, the total energy is conserved when accounting for all forms, including heat.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Consider a spaceship in deep space moving at a constant velocity. Once it is set in motion by an initial force, it continues moving due to inertia after the net force becomes zero. Even though the spaceship is still moving (resulting in a displacement), since there is no longer an active force acting on it in the direction of this displacement (net force is zero), no additional work is done in its current state by that particular force. This illustrates that work is only done when a force is applied and causes displacement at that moment.",
    "explanation": "According to Newton’s first law, an object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Once in uniform motion (constant velocity), the net force is zero, so despite displacement occurring, no work is being done at that moment by the net force. This example highlights the distinction between displacement and work performed by an active force.",
