Conversely, when placed in a concentrated salt solution (a hypertonic solution), water exits the egg, leading it to shrink.",

    "correct_answer": "The plasma membrane is essential for maintaining cellular integrity and mediating vital activities such as gas exchange, nutrient uptake, and endocytosis.

This structure allows the membrane to facilitate the diffusion of gases, transport nutrients into the cell via active and passive mechanisms, and enable endocytosis where the cell engulfs external materials. The fluid nature of the lipid bilayer is crucial in adapting to changes in the environment and in communicating with adjacent cells.",

In contrast, eukaryotic cells are larger (5â€“100 Âµm), contain a true nucleus enclosed by a membrane with multiple linear chromosomes, and have various membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. Ribosomes in the cytoplasm and rough ER are 80S (but 70S ribosomes are also found in mitochondria and chloroplasts).",
    "explanation": "This differentiation highlights key structural and functional distinctions.

    "correct_answer": "(i) Water gathers in cups B and C because the solutions in those cups are hypertonic relative to the potato cells; the high solute concentration causes water to move into the potato cells by osmosis, accumulating in the hollowed portion. (ii) Cup A serves as a control to show that in the absence of an osmotic gradient, there is no significant movement of water into the potato cells. (iii) In cup A, without any added solute, there is no osmotic gradient to drive water accumulation. In cup D, the boiled potato cells have lost the integrity of their selectively permeable membranes, so osmosis cannot occur effectively.",
    "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates osmotic principles. In a hypertonic solution (cups B and C), the external solute concentration is higher than that inside the cell, drawing water into the cells and causing the cavity to fill.

Later, Leeuwenhoek improved the microscope and discovered free-living cells in pond water. Robert Brownâ€™s discovery of the nucleus in 1831 advanced the understanding of cell organization. Schleiden and Schwann formulated the cell theory in 1838-1839, proposing that all organisms are made up of cells, and Virchow later added that all cells arise from pre-existing cells in 1855. The invention of the electron microscope in the 1940s provided a much higher resolution view of the cell, revealing complex structures and organelles that were previously undetectable, thereby significantly advancing cellular biology.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "COâ‚‚ moves across the cell membrane by diffusion, which is the passive movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. In a similar manner, water moves by osmosisâ€”a specific type of diffusionâ€”across a selectively permeable membrane, moving from a region of high water concentration (or low solute concentration) to a region of low water concentration (or high solute concentration).",
    "explanation": "Diffusion is the process whereby molecules like COâ‚‚ naturally move down their concentration gradient without energy expenditure. Osmosis, being a type of diffusion, involves the movement of water through the plasma membrane. This process is controlled by the selective permeability of the membrane, which allows water and certain molecules to pass while restricting others.

    "correct_answer": "The plasma membrane is called a selectively permeable membrane because it permits the entry and exit of only certain substances while preventing others from crossing. This selectivity is due to its lipid bilayer structure interspersed with proteins that regulate transport.",
    "explanation": "The term 'selectively permeable' highlights the property of the plasma membrane that allows specific molecules (such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients) to pass through, often by passive mechanisms like diffusion or osmosis, or via active transport when energy is needed. This selective regulation enables the cell to maintain homeostasis, controlling internal conditions despite varying external environments.

    "explanation": "Each cell contains organelles that perform specific functions essential for the maintenance and survival of the organism.
