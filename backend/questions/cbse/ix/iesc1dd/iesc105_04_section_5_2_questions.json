    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Diffusion is the passive movement of molecules from areas of high concentration to low concentration, and osmosis is the specific diffusion of water. For example, oxygen diffuses into the cell and carbon dioxide diffuses out of it, while water moves into a cell in a hypotonic solution (leading to swelling) and out of a cell in a hypertonic solution (causing shrinkage).",
    "explanation": "These processes are essential for transporting gases and maintaining water balance within cells. In diffusion, no external energy is required since it is based solely on concentration gradients. Osmosis is especially critical in maintaining a balance of water and solutes to ensure proper cell function and homeostasis.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiment involves dissolving the eggshell with dilute hydrochloric acid to expose the semipermeable membrane of the egg. When the egg is placed in pure water (a hypotonic solution), water enters the egg by osmosis causing it to swell. Conversely, when placed in a concentrated salt solution (a hypertonic solution), water exits the egg, leading it to shrink.",
    "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates osmotic principles. In hypotonic conditions, the concentration of water outside the egg is higher, resulting in a net influx of water. In hypertonic conditions, the solute concentration outside the egg is higher, which draws water out of the egg. This simple experiment effectively illustrates how cells interact with their environment through osmosis.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The plasma membrane is essential for maintaining cellular integrity and mediating vital activities such as gas exchange, nutrient uptake, and endocytosis. It is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins that provide selective permeability and flexibility. This structure allows the membrane to facilitate the diffusion of gases, transport nutrients into the cell via active and passive mechanisms, and enable endocytosis where the cell engulfs external materials. The fluid nature of the lipid bilayer is crucial in adapting to changes in the environment and in communicating with adjacent cells.",
    "explanation": "The structure of the plasma membrane, with its mixture of lipids and proteins, is fundamental to its function. The lipids provide a flexible, semi-fluid matrix, while the proteins act as channels and receptors for selective transport. These combined features support essential processes such as cellular respiration (via gas exchange), nutrient delivery, and cellular defense and communication via endocytosis.",
