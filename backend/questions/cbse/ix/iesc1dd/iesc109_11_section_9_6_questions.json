    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In Activity 9.7, initially, when the stone is suspended in air, the spring balance shows the full weight of the stone, causing maximum elongation of the string. As the stone is gradually immersed in water, the water exerts an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the water displaced, causing the net force on the spring balance to be reduced. This results in a lower reading. Once the stone is fully immersed, the volume of water displaced becomes constant; hence, the buoyant force remains constant, and no further decrease in the spring balance reading is observed.",
    "explanation": "This observation confirms Archimedes’ Principle. The buoyant force depends solely on the displaced water's volume and density, which remain unchanged after complete immersion of the stone.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Archimedes’ Principle is critical in ship and submarine design. Ships float because their hulls are designed to displace a volume of water whose weight is equal to or greater than the ship’s weight, ensuring a buoyant force that keeps them afloat. Submarines, on the other hand, can adjust their buoyancy by regulating the amount of water in their ballast tanks. By taking in water, a submarine increases its weight relative to the displaced water, thus reducing buoyancy and allowing it to sink. Conversely, by expelling water, the submarine decreases its overall weight and increases buoyancy to rise to the surface.",
    "explanation": "These designs highlight the principle that buoyant force depends on the displaced water volume. Effective control of this force is essential for maritime navigation and underwater operations, ensuring stability and maneuverability of vessels in various water conditions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The buoyant force does not remain the same for an object submerged in different fluids. Although the object displaces the same volume of fluid, the buoyant force depends on the fluid’s density. In a denser fluid (e.g., saltwater) the weight of the displaced fluid is higher, producing a greater buoyant force compared to a less dense fluid (e.g., freshwater). Thus, for the same object, the buoyant force is greater in fluids with higher densities.",
    "explanation": "Archimedes’ Principle shows that buoyancy is a function of the volume displaced and the fluid's density. Hence, differing fluid densities directly impact the magnitude of the buoyant force, which is critical in applications ranging from marine engineering to fluid measurements.",
