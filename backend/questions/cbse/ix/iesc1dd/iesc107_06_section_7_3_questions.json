    "correct_answer": "One example of acceleration in the direction of motion is a car speeding up on a highway. Here, the car's engine provides a force in the direction of the car's movement, resulting in a positive acceleration that increases its speed. An example of acceleration against the direction of motion is a car braking on a straight road. In this case, the braking force acts opposite to the car's motion, causing a negative acceleration that decreases its speed.",
    "explanation": "In the speeding up scenario, the force and acceleration work to increase velocity, whereas in the braking scenario, the force opposes the motion, reducing velocity.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correct_answer": "During the first interval, the bicyclist experiences a positive acceleration calculated as a = (6 m/s - 0 m/s) / 30 s = 0.2 m/s², indicating an increase in speed. In the second interval, the acceleration is negative with a value of a = (4 m/s - 6 m/s) / 5 s = -0.4 m/s², which reflects deceleration (slowing down). The positive acceleration means the force is in the same direction as the velocity, while the negative acceleration means the force opposes the velocity.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A freely falling object near Earth's surface experiences a nearly constant acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s², due to the uniform gravitational field. This constant acceleration arises because the gravitational force acting on the object remains essentially unchanged over the short vertical distances involved in everyday activities. As a result, objects in free fall increase their velocity at a constant rate, which is observed in practical scenarios such as raindrops falling or a dropped ball accelerating downward.",
    "explanation": "Gravitational acceleration is nearly constant near Earth's surface because the variation of the gravitational field strength over small height differences is negligible. This uniform acceleration is a key concept in understanding the motion of objects under gravity and has numerous real-world applications, from understanding the fall of objects to planning safe drop zones in engineering projects.",
