    "correct_answer": "Solubility is the maximum amount of a solute that can be dissolved in a given quantity of solvent at a specific temperature to form a saturated solution. The experiment shows that when a solution is heated (temperature increased), more solute can dissolve, indicating that solubility generally increases with temperature for most solids.",
    "explanation": "Solubility depends on temperature; when a solution is saturated at a given temperature, it cannot dissolve more solute. However, if the temperature is raised, the increased kinetic energy allows more solute to interact with the solvent, hence increasing the solubility.",

    "correct_answer": "The Tyndall effect is the scattering of light by particles in a colloid, making the path of the light visible. This effect distinguishes colloidal solutions from true solutions because, in true solutions, the solute particles are too small to scatter light.",
    "explanation": "In colloids, the relatively larger particle size (compared to true solutions) scatters light effectively, making a beam of light visible when it passes through. True solutions, having molecular-sized particles, do not scatter light, so the light beam is not seen.",

    "correct_answer": "The mass by mass percentage concentration is calculated as: (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) × 100. Here, Mass of solution = 40 g + 320 g = 360 g. Therefore, concentration = (40/360) × 100 ≈ 11.1%.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where solute particles are at molecular dimensions (typically less than 1 nm) making them invisible to the naked eye; they are stable and do not scatter light. Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures with larger particles that are visible and tend to settle upon standing, and they scatter light significantly. Colloidal solutions, while appearing homogeneous, have particles that are intermediate in size between those in true solutions and suspensions; they do not settle easily due to Brownian motion and scatter light (exhibiting the Tyndall effect).",
    "explanation": "The key differences lie in particle size and behavior: true solutions have very small, uniformly distributed particles; suspensions have large, non-uniform particles that settle over time; and colloids have particles that are small enough to remain evenly distributed but large enough to scatter light, making the mixture appear turbid.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Firstly, take several identical beakers and measure an equal volume of water (for example, 50 mL) into each. Add incrementally measured amounts of salt to each beaker with continuous stirring until no more salt dissolves, indicating a saturated solution. Record the maximum mass of salt dissolved at room temperature. Next, heat separate beakers to different set temperatures (e.g., 30°C, 40°C, 50°C) and repeat the process. Record the maximum amount of salt dissolved at each temperature. The expected observation is that the solubility of salt increases with temperature (for most solids). Data can be tabulated showing temperature versus mass of salt dissolved, and solubility curves can be drawn.",
    "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates the effect of temperature on solubility. By systematically varying temperature and measuring the corresponding solubility, the relationship can be quantified.

    "correct_answer": "Colloidal solutions are significant in many everyday products ranging from food items like milk and mayonnaise to medical formulations like ointments and gels. Their stability and unique light-scattering properties make them valuable for delivering specific textures, flavors, and appearances. The Tyndall effect, which is the scattering of light by colloidal particles, is a diagnostic feature used to identify colloids. When a beam of light passes through a colloidal system, the light is scattered, making the beam visible. This is not seen in true solutions, hence the Tyndall effect is an important tool for distinguishing between colloidal and true solutions.",
    "explanation": "Practical applications of colloids extend into multiple fields. The Tyndall effect, observable in everyday situations (like the visibility of beams of light through fog), provides insight into the size of dispersed particles and the stability of the colloid. This understanding guides the formulation and quality control of products in industries such as food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.",
