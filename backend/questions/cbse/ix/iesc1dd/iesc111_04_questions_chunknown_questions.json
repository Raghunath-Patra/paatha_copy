    "correct_answer": "Amplitude determines loudness and frequency determines pitch.",
    "explanation": "Loudness, or the perceived volume of a sound, depends on the amplitude of the sound wave. A greater amplitude means a stronger vibration, which produces a louder sound. On the other hand, pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound wave â€“ how many compressions and rarefactions pass a fixed point per unit time. A higher frequency produces a higher pitch. This fundamental relationship between amplitude and loudness, and frequency and pitch, is demonstrated in the activities and diagrams provided in sections 11.1 and 11.2.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A guitar produces a higher pitch sound than a car horn.",
    "explanation": "The pitch of a sound is directly related to its frequency. In most cases, the vibration frequency of guitar strings is higher than that of a car horn. This means that the guitar generates more compressions and rarefactions per second, leading to a higher pitch. This concept was highlighted when discussing how different objects vibrate to produce sound at varying frequencies.",
