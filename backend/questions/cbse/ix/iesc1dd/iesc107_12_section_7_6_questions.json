    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a stone is tied to a thread and whirled in a circle, the tension in the thread provides the centripetal force necessary to keep the stone moving in a circular path at constant speed. Although the speed remains constant, the continuous change in the stone's direction implies the presence of an acceleration directed toward the center of the circle (centripetal acceleration). When the stone is released, the centripetal force is no longer acting on it. According to Newton's first law of motion (inertia), the stone continues moving in a straight line in the direction of its instantaneous velocity at the point of release, which is tangent to the circular path.",
    "explanation": "The explanation emphasizes that the centripetal force is crucial for maintaining the circular path. Once this force is removed, inertia takes over, causing the stone to travel in a straight line along the tangent.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A regular polygon track, such as a rectangle, hexagon, or octagon, involves discrete changes in the direction of motion at each vertex. As the number of sides increases, each individual turn becomes smaller, and in the limit when the number of sides approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. In a circular track, there are no sudden turns; instead, the direction changes continuously, and the velocity vector is always tangent to the circle at any given point. This seamless change in direction is maintained by a continuous centripetal force that keeps the object in a curved path.",
    "explanation": "This answer connects the geometric evolution of a polygonal path into a circular one with the physics of motion. It highlights that with more sides, the object's path approaches a circle and that the nature of velocity becomes continuously tangential, which requires a constant centripetal force.",

In the context of uniform circular motion, if the centripetal force is suddenly removed, the object will no longer be forced to change direction, so instead of continuing along the circular path, it will move in a straight line tangent to the circle at the point of release.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Both planetary orbits and an athlete running on a circular track involve motion where the direction of the velocity vector is constantly changing. In a circular orbit, a satellite moves with a constant speed and is kept on its curved path by the gravitational force acting as the centripetal force. Similarly, an athlete running on a circular track experiences a centripetal force (derived from friction or banking of the track) that continuously redirects the athlete’s velocity. The key difference is that for planetary orbits, the force is gravitational and the motion can be influenced by elliptical dynamics and varying speeds, whereas in uniform circular motion on a track the speed is maintained constant by design.",
    "explanation": "This answer contrasts real-world orbital mechanics with an idealized terrestrial example. It emphasizes that while both systems require a centripetal force to maintain the circular path, the nature of the force (gravitational versus friction or tension) and the constraints on speed can differ.",
