    "correct_answer": "Liquids have particles that are loosely bound compared to solids, which allows them to move past one another. This characteristic enables a liquid to take the shape of its container while its volume remains unchanged because the number of particles and the space they occupy stays constant.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Compressibility refers to the ability of a substance to decrease in volume when pressure is applied. Gases are highly compressible because their particles are spread far apart, allowing them to be pushed nearer to each other when force is applied. For example, a gas cylinder uses compression to store a large amount of gas in a limited space.",
    "explanation": "The considerable empty space between gas particles means that when pressure is applied, the particles can be forced closer together, unlike in solids and liquids where the particles are in close contact with little free space.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "In the syringe experiment, three syringes were used: one contained air, one contained water, and one contained pieces of chalk. When the pistons were pushed into each syringe, it was observed that the air-filled syringe's piston could be pushed in easily, demonstrating high compressibility of gases. In contrast, the water-filled syringe offered significant resistance, and the syringe with chalk pieces was almost impossible to compress. The experiment demonstrates that gases are highly compressible, liquids are nearly incompressible, and solids have negligible compressibility.",
    "explanation": "The experiment clearly shows the differences in particle packing among the states of matter. Gases have lots of empty space that can be compressed, whereas liquids and solids have particles that are arranged much more densely. This setup allows students to visualize the fundamental differences in behavior under pressure.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Diffusion is the process by which particles spread from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. In solids, diffusion is very slow because particles are fixed in place and can only vibrate within a set position. In liquids, particles can move more freely, resulting in a faster rate of diffusion compared to solids. Gases have particles that move in random, rapid motion over large spaces due to the large gaps between them, which leads to very rapid diffusion. A real-life example is the way the aroma of food quickly reaches different parts of a room when cooking, as the gas particles carrying the smell diffuse rapidly through the air.",
    "explanation": "The differences in the rate of diffusion among the states of matter are directly related to the arrangement and energy of the particles. In gases, the high kinetic energy and spacious arrangement allow for rapid and efficient mixing, while in solids and liquids, restricted movement slows down the process.",

    "correct_answer": "False. A rubber band is considered a solid because it has a definite shape, fixed volume, and rigidity under normal conditions, despite its ability to stretch elastically and return to its original form.",
    "explanation": "Rubber bands exhibit elastic behavior, which means they can temporarily change shape under applied stress but return to their original form once the stress is removed. This elasticity does not disqualify them from being classified as solids.",
