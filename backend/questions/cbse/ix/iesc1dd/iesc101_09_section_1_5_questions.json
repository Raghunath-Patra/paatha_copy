    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Latent heat of vaporization is the amount of heat energy required to convert a unit mass of a liquid into vapor without a change in temperature. During evaporation, the liquid absorbs this heat from its surroundings, which can lead to a cooling effect in the vicinity.",
    "explanation": "This concept explains why evaporation cools the surface from which the liquid evaporates â€“ energy is absorbed in the phase change, reducing the thermal energy of the surroundings.",

    "correct_answer": "High humidity means the air is saturated with water vapor, reducing the gradient needed for more water to evaporate. Conversely, low humidity allows for faster evaporation since the air can accept more vapor.",

    "correct_answer": "An experiment can be set up using three containers: a test tube (small surface area) and two open china dishes (large surface area) placed under different conditions (e.g., near a window, under a fan, and inside a cupboard). The independent variables include the surface area and wind velocity, while the controlled variables are the volume of water (e.g., 5 mL) and ambient temperature (recorded). Expected observations are that water in the container with the largest surface area and highest wind speed (under a fan) will evaporate the fastest, while the container in a sheltered environment (inside a cupboard) will show the slowest evaporation.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When acetone is applied on the skin, the acetone molecules require energy to transition into the vapor phase. These molecules absorb energy (latent heat of vaporization) from the skin, lowering its temperature. As the acetone evaporates, this energy absorption results in cooling of the skin surface. The process clearly demonstrates how the latent heat plays a critical role in reducing the temperature of the surrounding medium.",
    "explanation": "This response discusses the energy absorption during evaporation, highlighting the latent heat of vaporization and its direct effect on cooling. The example of acetone illustrates how a rapid phase change can extract heat from the body, thereby lowering skin temperature.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Temperature increases the kinetic energy of liquid particles, resulting in a higher probability that molecules at the surface will escape into the vapor phase, thus accelerating evaporation. In contrast, high humidity means that the air is already saturated with water vapor, which reduces the evaporation rate. For instance, on a hot and dry day, clothes dry quickly because the high temperature promotes evaporation and the low humidity allows for the rapid removal of water vapor from the surface. Conversely, in a humid environment or during a rainy day, evaporation is significantly slower.",
