    "options": [
      "Air",
      "Water",
      "Iron",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Iron",
    "explanation": "Sound travels faster in solids than in liquids and gases because the particles in a solid are packed much closer together, facilitating quicker transmission of vibrational energy. In iron, which is a solid, the interparticle spacing is minimal, so the compression and rarefaction processes occur more rapidly compared to water or air. This is a direct consequence of the physical properties of materials and the principles of mechanical wave propagation.",
