    "correct_answer": "First, calculate his weight: Weight = mass × g = 50 kg × 10 m/s² = 500 N. Total height = 45 steps × 0.15 m = 6.75 m. Work done = weight × height = 500 N × 6.75 m = 3375 J. Power = work/time = 3375 J / 9 s = 375 W.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When the time taken to perform a given work decreases, the power output increases, and vice versa, as power is inversely proportional to time (P = W/t). For example, if two identical cars travel the same distance, the one that completes the journey faster consumes energy at a higher rate, hence has a higher power rating. Similarly, a strong person climbing a rope faster will have a higher power output compared to someone who takes more time, even though the total energy expenditure (work) is the same.",
