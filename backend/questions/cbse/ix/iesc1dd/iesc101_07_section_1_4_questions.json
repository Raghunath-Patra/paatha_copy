    ],
    "correct_answer": "B) Energy required to change 1 kg of a solid into a liquid at its melting point. At the melting point, the supplied heat energy is used to overcome the attractive forces between particles without increasing temperature.",
    "explanation": "The latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat energy required to convert 1 kg of a solid into liquid at its melting point under atmospheric pressure. Despite continuous heating during the phase change, the temperature remains constant because the energy is absorbed as latent heat.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Melting ice involves the absorption of heat energy that increases the vibrational motion of its molecules. Once the ice reaches its melting point (0°C or 273 K), the energy absorbed is used to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules rather than raising the temperature. This energy is known as latent heat of fusion and facilitates the transition from a tightly arranged solid structure to a more loosely arranged liquid state.",
    "explanation": "In solids like ice, molecules are fixed in a crystal lattice and only vibrate in place. When heat is applied, these vibrations become more energetic. At the melting point, the energy provided is absorbed solely to overcome the intermolecular forces, causing the ice to change into liquid water without a temperature increase. The latent heat of fusion quantifies this energy required for the phase change.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Boiling water involves heating a liquid until it reaches its boiling point (373 K or 100°C at atmospheric pressure). At this point, the energy supplied is used to break the intermolecular forces (overcome cohesion) and transform the liquid into vapor, rather than causing a rise in temperature. This absorbed energy is termed the latent heat of vaporisation. The kinetic energy of the water molecules increases with temperature, and at boiling point, sufficient energy allows molecules from the entire liquid mass to escape into the gas phase.",
    "explanation": "During boiling, despite continuous heat input, the temperature remains constant because the energy goes into changing the state rather than increasing the temperature. The latent heat of vaporisation is the energy needed per kilogram to change the phase, which is critical in understanding boiling phenomena. The transition also signifies that molecules have achieved a kinetic energy level high enough to overcome the intermolecular attractions binding them in the liquid state.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Pressure and temperature are key parameters that determine the state of matter. Increasing temperature generally increases the kinetic energy of particles, leading to phase transitions like melting or boiling. Conversely, increasing pressure forces particles closer together, which can induce a phase change by promoting interactions among particles—such as the liquefaction of a gas. For example, in compressing a gas in a cylinder with a movable piston, reducing the volume increases the pressure, bringing the particles close enough for attractive forces to take over, potentially forming a liquid. In the case of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), under high pressure solid CO₂ sublimates directly to gas when the pressure is reduced to atmospheric levels, illustrating that pressure changes can manipulate phase change pathways.",
    "explanation": "This question examines the interplay between pressure and temperature. High pressure can induce condensation by reducing the space between gas molecules, while high temperature increases kinetic energy leading to less ordered states. The experimental setups such as a compressed gas in a piston-cylinder arrangement or sublimation setups for substances like CO₂ help visualize these principles in real-world applications. Such experiments demonstrate the phase diagram of substances that shows regions where a substance exists as a solid, liquid, or gas.",
