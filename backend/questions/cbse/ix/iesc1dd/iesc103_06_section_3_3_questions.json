    "correct_answer": "To determine the ratio by number of atoms in a compound, divide the given mass ratio of each element by its atomic mass and simplify the resulting fractions to the smallest whole numbers. In water (H₂O), the mass ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 1:8. Dividing by their atomic masses (1 for H and 16 for O) gives 1 for hydrogen and 8/16 = 0.5 for oxygen. Multiplying both by 2 yields a ratio of 2:1, meaning there are 2 hydrogen atoms for every 1 oxygen atom.",

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Atomicity is determined by the number of atoms in a molecule. In noble gases like argon (Ar) and helium (He), the atoms exist singly as monoatomic molecules. In contrast, non-metals such as oxygen (O₂) and hydrogen (H₂) form diatomic molecules. Some elements, like phosphorus, can form tetra-atomic molecules (P₄), and sulphur often appears as polyatomic molecules. The difference in atomicity arises from the nature of chemical bonds and the stability gained by having specific numbers of atoms per molecule.",
    "explanation": "The atomicity of an element depends on its electron structure and the energies involved in bond formation. Noble gases achieve stability with a full valence shell as single atoms, whereas other elements form bonds to achieve stability in groups, leading to different molecular forms which are reflected in their atomicity.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. In compounds containing metals and non-metals, metal atoms typically lose electrons to form positively charged cations, while non-metal atoms gain electrons to form negatively charged anions. For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium becomes Na⁺ and chlorine becomes Cl⁻. Additionally, groups of atoms that behave as a unit and carry a net charge are known as polyatomic ions (e.g., sulfate SO₄²⁻). Monoatomic ions consist of single atoms (e.g., Na⁺ or Cl⁻), while polyatomic ions are aggregates of atoms bonded together that exhibit an overall charge.",
    "explanation": "The formation of ions is driven by the tendency of atoms to reach a stable electron configuration. Metals, which have lower ionization energies, lose electrons easily to become cations, whereas non-metals, with higher electron affinities, gain electrons to become anions. In some cases, groups of atoms bond together and share or transfer electrons collectively, forming polyatomic ions.",
