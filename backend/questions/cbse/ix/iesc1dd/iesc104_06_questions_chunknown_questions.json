    "correct_answer": "Electron, Proton, Neutron",
    "explanation": "An atom is composed of three primary sub-atomic particles: electrons (e⁻), which carry a negative charge; protons (p⁺), which carry a positive charge; and neutrons, which are electrically neutral. These particles combine to form the basic structure of the atom and explain many of its physical and chemical properties.",

    "question_text": "A Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus. How many neutrons does it have?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "2 neutrons",
    "explanation": "The atomic mass of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. For Helium, which has an atomic mass of 4 u and contains 2 protons, the number of neutrons is calculated as follows: 4 u - 2 protons = 2 neutrons. This demonstrates the concept of the mass number in atomic structure.",
