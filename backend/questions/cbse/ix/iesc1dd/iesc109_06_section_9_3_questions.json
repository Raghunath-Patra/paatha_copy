    "correct_answer": "Mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object and is constant regardless of its location. Weight is the force exerted by gravity on that mass, which means it varies with the gravitational field strength.",
    "explanation": "The main difference is that mass is an intrinsic property, while weight depends on external factors like gravitational acceleration. For instance, an object’s mass remains unchanged on Earth or the Moon, but its weight decreases in a weaker gravitational field.",

    "correct_answer": "Mass is a measure of the amount of matter and hence a measure of inertia, which is the resistance to changes in motion. Gravitational force, however, acts on mass to give an object weight. For instance, an astronaut in orbit has the same mass (and therefore the same inertia) as on Earth, but experiences weightlessness because the gravitational pull is effectively balanced by the orbital motion.",
    "explanation": "This relationship shows that while mass (and thus inertia) remains constant regardless of location, the force due to gravity (weight) can vary significantly depending on the environment.

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Experiments such as those performed in a vacuum chamber demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate in the absence of air resistance, regardless of their masses. This shows that acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass, thereby highlighting that mass remains constant while weight (which is proportional to gravitational acceleration) can vary in different environments. Such experiments on Earth compared to those on the Moon further illustrate that weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field, though the mass remains unchanged.",
    "explanation": "By analyzing free-fall experiments, students can understand that weight is the product of mass and gravitational acceleration. Since the acceleration due to gravity differs on Earth and the Moon, weight measurements will vary even though the mass does not. This distinction clarifies the unique and constant nature of mass versus the variable nature of weight.",
