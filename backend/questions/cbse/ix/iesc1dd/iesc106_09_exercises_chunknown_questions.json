    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Simple tissues are composed of only one type of cell (such as parenchyma, collenchyma, or sclerenchyma) while complex tissues are made up of more than one type of cell working together, as in xylem and phloem.",
    "explanation": "The distinction lies in cellular uniformity. Simple tissues contain cells that are similar in structure and function, whereas complex tissues consist of multiple cell types that coordinate to perform conducting and supportive functions.",

    "correct_answer": "Parenchyma cells have thin, primary cell walls primarily made of cellulose; Collenchyma cells have unevenly thickened primary cell walls (rich in cellulose and pectin) especially at the corners; Sclerenchyma cells possess thick, lignified secondary cell walls.",
    "explanation": "The differences in cell wall composition and thickness confer different functions. Parenchyma is mainly for storage and photosynthesis, collenchyma provides flexible support in growing parts, and sclerenchyma lends rigidity and structural strength to mature tissues.",

    "type": "Long Answer",

    "correct_answer": "Striated (skeletal) muscles are long, cylindrical, unbranched, multinucleate with peripheral nuclei and present in limbs and body walls; Unstriated (smooth) muscles are spindle-shaped, uninucleate, non-striated and located in internal organs like the intestine and blood vessels; Cardiac muscles are cylindrical, branched, uninucleate with central nuclei, and are found in the walls of the heart.",
    "explanation": "The differences in muscle fibre structure directly relate to their function and location in the body. Skeletal muscles are adapted for voluntary movement, smooth muscles control involuntary movements within internal organs, and cardiac muscle is specialized for continuous, rhythmic contraction to pump blood.",

    "explanation": "Each tissue is identified based on its structure and function. For instance, skin protects the body, cork provides a protective outer layer in trees, bone supports structural integrity, kidney tubule lining functions in secretion/absorption, and vascular bundles facilitate transport in plants.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Cork acts as a protective tissue because its cells are dead, compactly arranged without intercellular spaces, and contain suberin in their walls, making them impermeable to water and gases.",
