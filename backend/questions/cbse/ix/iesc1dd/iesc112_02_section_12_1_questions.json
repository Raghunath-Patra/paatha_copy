    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Diversification in crop types ensures that a wide range of nutrients are available for consumption, helping to maintain balanced nutrition and mitigate risks associated with crop failure. Cereals provide energy, pulses contribute proteins, oil seeds supply essential fats, while vegetables, fruits, and spices provide vitamins and minerals. Fodder crops support livestock health, which in turn supports animal-based food production.",
    "explanation": "This diversity reduces dependence on a single crop type, thereby enhancing food security at both household and national levels. Ecologically, diversified farming can help maintain soil health and reduce pest outbreaks. Moreover, a balanced diet is crucial for overall human health, and the integration of multiple crop types in agriculture plays a key role in achieving that balance.",

    "correct_answer": "Fodder crops such as berseem, oats, and sudan grass serve as an essential food source for livestock, thereby supporting animal husbandry. Healthy livestock are necessary not only for direct consumption (meat, milk, eggs) but also for providing labor and generating secondary products such as manure, which can improve soil fertility.",
    "explanation": "Cultivating fodder crops ensures a continuous and reliable source of nutrition for animals, which is especially important during periods when natural grazing fields are not sufficient. This integration strengthens the overall agricultural ecosystem by linking crop production with animal rearing and sustainable farming practices.",
