    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The acceleration of the bus is approximately -1.11 m s⁻².",
    "explanation": "First, convert the speeds from km/h to m/s: 80 km/h = 80*(5/18) ≈ 22.22 m/s and 60 km/h = 60*(5/18) ≈ 16.67 m/s. The acceleration is calculated using the formula a = (v - u) / t, where u is the initial speed and v is the final speed. Substituting the values, we get a = (16.67 m/s - 22.22 m/s) / 5 s = -5.55 m/s / 5 s = -1.11 m/s². The negative sign indicates a reduction (deceleration) in speed.",

    "correct_answer": "The acceleration of the train is approximately 0.0185 m s⁻² (or 1/54 m s⁻²).",
    "explanation": "Begin by noting that the initial speed (u) is 0 m/s since the train starts from rest. Convert the final speed from km/h to m/s: 40 km/h = 40*(5/18) ≈ 11.11 m/s. Convert time from minutes to seconds: 10 minutes = 600 seconds. Using the formula a = (v - u) / t, we get a = (11.11 m/s - 0 m/s) / 600 s ≈ 0.0185 m/s².

As the number of sides increases, each individual turn becomes smaller, and in the limit when the number of sides approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. In a circular track, there are no sudden turns; instead, the direction changes continuously, and the velocity vector is always tangent to the circle at any given point. This seamless change in direction is maintained by a continuous centripetal force that keeps the object in a curved path.",

In a circular orbit, a satellite moves with a constant speed and is kept on its curved path by the gravitational force acting as the centripetal force. Similarly, an athlete running on a circular track experiences a centripetal force (derived from friction or banking of the track) that continuously redirects the athlete’s velocity. The key difference is that for planetary orbits, the force is gravitational and the motion can be influenced by elliptical dynamics and varying speeds, whereas in uniform circular motion on a track the speed is maintained constant by design.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To calculate the stopping distance, first use the equation v = u + at with the final velocity v = 0 to determine the car’s deceleration (a). Once a is known, use the equation s = ut + ½at², substituting the known initial velocity (u), the calculated acceleration (a), and the time taken to stop. Alternatively, after finding a, you can directly use the equation 2as = v² – u² (with v = 0) to find s = u²/(2|a|).",
    "explanation": "The process involves determining the deceleration first and then using one of the equations of motion that links velocity and displacement without time, ensuring all units are consistent. This approach is used, for example, as in Example 7.7.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "During the acceleration phase: a = 8/4 = 2 m/s², s1 = 0 × 4 + ½ × 2 × (4²) = 16 m. During the constant speed phase: s2 = 8 m/s × 10 s = 80 m. During the deceleration phase: using u=8, v=0, t=3 s, a = (0 - 8)/3 = -8/3 m/s², s3 = 8 × 3 + ½ × (-8/3) × (3²) = 24 - 12 = 12 m. Total distance s = 16 + 80 + 12 = 108 m.",
    "explanation": "The problem is solved by breaking the motion into three phases and using the appropriate equations of motion for each phase: (7.6) for the acceleration phase and the deceleration phase (adjusted for negative acceleration), and the simple relation distance = speed × time for the constant speed phase.",

    "explanation": "The distance covered during deceleration depends on the average velocity during that time interval. Since reducing the speed only partially (from 15 m/s to 5 m/s) results in a higher average velocity than reducing it fully to zero, the distance covered is indeed greater.",
