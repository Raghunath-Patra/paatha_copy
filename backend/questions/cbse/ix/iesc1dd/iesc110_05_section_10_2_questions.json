    "correct_answer": "The potential energy stored in the elevated mass is converted into kinetic energy as the mass falls, causing the trolley to move. The falling mass exerts a force via a pulley system, accelerating the trolley, which then transfers its kinetic energy when it collides with another object (like a wooden block).",
    "explanation": "This process demonstrates the conservation of energy: the potential energy (due to height) is converted into kinetic energy (motion) as the mass falls, and then transferred from the trolley to the block during the collision.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "First, convert the speeds to m/s: 30 km/h = 30×(5/18) m/s = 25/3 m/s; 60 km/h = 60×(5/18) m/s = 50/3 m/s. Initial kinetic energy = ½ × 1500 kg × (25/3 m/s)² and final kinetic energy = ½ × 1500 kg × (50/3 m/s)². Calculations yield initial KE ≈ 156250/3 J and final KE ≈ 625000/3 J. The work done (change in kinetic energy) is (625000/3 - 156250/3) J = 468750/3 J ≈ 156250 J.",
    "explanation": "This demonstrates that kinetic energy increases with the square of the velocity; doubling the speed from 30 km/h to 60 km/h increases the kinetic energy by a factor of about 4, assuming the mass remains the same. The calculation shows the quantitative change in energy needed to achieve this increase in speed.",

    "correct_answer": "Energy can be transferred from one object to another when work is done. For example, when a moving bullet pierces a target, its kinetic energy is transferred to the target, causing penetration. Similarly, a windmill converts the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy, and then into electrical energy. In the case of a falling object, gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy during the fall, which upon impact, can be transferred to another object as work.",
    "explanation": "This answer should include the concept of energy transfer, the transformation from one form of energy to another (e.g., potential to kinetic), and cite clear examples such as the motion of a bullet, the operation of windmills, and the energy conversion in a falling mass system.",
