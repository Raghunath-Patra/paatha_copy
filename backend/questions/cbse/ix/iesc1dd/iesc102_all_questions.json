    "correct_answer": "Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where solute particles are at molecular dimensions (typically less than 1 nm) making them invisible to the naked eye; they are stable and do not scatter light. Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures with larger particles that are visible and tend to settle upon standing, and they scatter light significantly. Colloidal solutions, while appearing homogeneous, have particles that are intermediate in size between those in true solutions and suspensions; they do not settle easily due to Brownian motion and scatter light (exhibiting the Tyndall effect).",
    "explanation": "The key differences lie in particle size and behavior: true solutions have very small, uniformly distributed particles; suspensions have large, non-uniform particles that settle over time; and colloids have particles that are small enough to remain evenly distributed but large enough to scatter light, making the mixture appear turbid.",

Record the maximum mass of salt dissolved at room temperature. Next, heat separate beakers to different set temperatures (e.g., 30°C, 40°C, 50°C) and repeat the process. Record the maximum amount of salt dissolved at each temperature. The expected observation is that the solubility of salt increases with temperature (for most solids). Data can be tabulated showing temperature versus mass of salt dissolved, and solubility curves can be drawn.",

    "correct_answer": "Colloidal solutions are significant in many everyday products ranging from food items like milk and mayonnaise to medical formulations like ointments and gels. Their stability and unique light-scattering properties make them valuable for delivering specific textures, flavors, and appearances. The Tyndall effect, which is the scattering of light by colloidal particles, is a diagnostic feature used to identify colloids. When a beam of light passes through a colloidal system, the light is scattered, making the beam visible. This is not seen in true solutions, hence the Tyndall effect is an important tool for distinguishing between colloidal and true solutions.",
    "explanation": "Practical applications of colloids extend into multiple fields. The Tyndall effect, observable in everyday situations (like the visibility of beams of light through fog), provides insight into the size of dispersed particles and the stability of the colloid.

    "correct_answer": "A design could involve layering materials inside an earthen pot: first add a layer of coarse pebbles at the bottom to serve as the support and initial filter, followed by a layer of smaller pebbles. Next, add a layer of coarse sand and finish with a top layer of fine sand. Pour muddy water slowly onto the top layer; as it percolates through the layers, the larger particles will be trapped, and the filtered, cleaner water will collect at the bottom, which can be collected through a small opening or by using the pot's porous structure.",
    "explanation": "This design mimics natural filtration processes where sediment, sand, and rocks remove impurities from water. The approach uses physical barriers of decreasing particle sizes to gradually filter out suspended particles. This system demonstrates the principles of filtration and is an example of applying scientific concepts to solve a real-world problem.",

Perform tests including boiling point determination, chemical reactivity, and physical separation methods. For the homogeneous mixture, physical methods like evaporation or crystallization should separate the salt from the water, and the physical properties (like boiling point) would vary based on concentration. For a compound, decomposition by applying energy or chemical reactions (e.g., electrolysis of water yielding hydrogen and oxygen) is required since the elements are chemically bonded.

    "question_text": "Classify the following as chemical or physical changes: cutting of trees, melting of butter in a pan, rusting of almirah, boiling of water to form steam, passing of electric current through water causing its decomposition into hydrogen and oxygen gases, dissolving common salt in water, making a fruit salad with raw fruits, burning of paper and wood.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Cutting of trees – Physical; Melting of butter in a pan – Physical; Rusting of almirah – Chemical; Boiling of water to form steam – Physical; Passing of electric current through water causing its breakdown into hydrogen and oxygen gases – Chemical; Dissolving common salt in water – Physical; Making a fruit salad with raw fruits – Physical (the fruits undergo physical changes when cut and mixed); Burning of paper and wood – Chemical.",
    "explanation": "In physical changes, the substance’s chemical identity remains unchanged. Cutting trees, melting butter, boiling water, dissolving salt, and mixing fruits result in changes in form, state, or physical properties without altering chemical composition. In contrast, rusting of almirah and burning of paper and wood involve chemical reactions that produce new substances with different chemical properties. The process of electrolysis (passing electric current) causes the water to decompose into hydrogen and oxygen, which is also a chemical change.",

    "question_text": "Segregate the things around you as pure substances or mixtures. (For example, pure substances include water, sugar, salt, iron, gold; mixtures include air, soil, milk, lemonade, steel, brass.)",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Pure substances are materials that contain only one kind of matter and have fixed properties (e.g., water, sugar, salt, iron, gold). Mixtures consist of two or more substances combined physically, such as air (a mix of gases), soil (a mix of organic matter and minerals), milk (an emulsion/colloidal system), lemonade (a solution with dissolved sugar and flavoring), steel (an alloy of iron and carbon, among other elements), and brass (an alloy of copper and zinc).",
    "explanation": "A pure substance has a uniform composition and fixed properties and cannot be separated into other materials by physical means. In contrast, mixtures contain a combination of two or more components whose individual properties remain intact and can be separated by physical methods. The provided examples illustrate that substances like water or gold show consistent behavior, whereas mixtures, such as air or soil, consist of multiple components that can be observed, separated, or identified individually.",

    "question_text": "Differentiate between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures with examples.",
    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A homogeneous mixture has a uniform composition throughout, where the individual components are not visually distinguishable (e.g., salt dissolved in water or sugar in water). In contrast, a heterogeneous mixture has non-uniform composition with visibly distinct parts (e.g., soil, salad, or a mixture of oil and water).",
    "explanation": "A homogeneous mixture, also known as a solution, exhibits uniform properties at the particle level, meaning that even under close scrutiny, such as using a microscope, the components are evenly distributed. Examples include copper sulphate solution prepared in activities A and B and everyday mixtures like lemonade. On the other hand, a heterogeneous mixture displays regions with different properties, as seen in mixtures like soil or a suspension of salt and iron filings. This differentiation is significant in experimental procedures where identification of mixture types helps in selecting proper separation techniques such as filtration (effective for suspensions) or evaporation (used to isolate solutes in solutions).",

    "question_text": "How are sol, solution and suspension different from each other?",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "They differ primarily in particle size, appearance, stability, filterability, and the Tyndall effect. In a solution, the solute particles are less than 1 nm in size, rendering the mixture homogeneous, stable, non-filterable, and without visible light scattering. A suspension contains large particles (typically >1000 nm) that are visible to the naked eye, causing the mixture to be heterogeneous, unstable (particles settle over time), and filterable. A colloidal solution (sol) has intermediate particle sizes (1–1000 nm); it appears homogeneous but is actually heterogeneous, stable over time, non-filterable by ordinary means, and exhibits the Tyndall effect (light scattering).",
    "explanation": "This differentiation is based on microscopic particle size and physical behavior of the mixture. In solutions, due to the very small size of particles, the light does not scatter, and the solute remains evenly dispersed. Suspensions contain larger particles that not only scatter light (often observed as a visible beam when light passes through) but also tend to settle if left undisturbed and can be filtered out. Colloids occupy a middle ground where the particles are small enough to avoid settling rapidly yet large enough to scatter light, as demonstrated by the Tyndall effect. These distinctions are crucial in applications ranging from chemical solution preparation to industrial processes such as centrifugation for colloid separation.",

    "question_text": "To make a saturated solution, 36 g of sodium chloride is dissolved in 100 g of water at 293 K. Find its concentration at this temperature.",
    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The concentration of the solution, in terms of mass percentage, is approximately 26.47%. This is calculated by dividing the mass of the solute (36 g) by the total mass of the solution (36 g + 100 g = 136 g), and multiplying by 100: (36/136) × 100 ≈ 26.47%.",
    "explanation": "The concentration of a solution is calculated using the formula: Mass percentage = (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) × 100. Here, the mass of the solute (NaCl) is 36 g and the solvent (water) is 100 g, making the total mass of the solution 136 g. This method of determining concentration is critical for preparing solutions with precise properties in laboratory settings. This calculation reinforces concepts of solubility and saturation, illustrating how temperature and the relative amounts of solute and solvent impact the concentration of a solution.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A pure substance consists of a single type of particle, has a uniform composition throughout, and possesses definite and characteristic properties.",
    "explanation": "A pure substance is composed of only one type of matter (element or compound) in which the composition is consistent and uniform no matter how small a sample is taken. For example, water (H₂O) or sodium chloride (NaCl) are pure substances because any sample from the substance would have the same chemical and physical properties. This concept is fundamental in distinguishing substances from mixtures, where a mixture contains two or more distinct substances. Understanding this distinction is crucial in various scientific investigations, such as separation methods and property analysis.",

    "correct_answer": "Homogeneous mixtures have a uniform composition where the individual components are not visibly distinguishable, and there are no distinct boundaries between them (e.g., salt dissolved in water). Heterogeneous mixtures exhibit non-uniform composition where the components are often visibly distinguishable, sometimes forming distinct layers or separate phases (e.g., sand and water).",
    "explanation": "Homogeneous mixtures, also called solutions, display uniform physical properties and consistent appearance throughout once the solute is completely dissolved. However, the concentration of the solute can vary (as seen with different shades of a copper sulphate solution), though the mixture remains uniform. On the other hand, in heterogeneous mixtures, the individual components can be identified by observing differences in color, texture, or phase separation. The distinction is important in practical applications such as chemical separation, quality control, and industrial formulations. The answer is based on experimental observations and the theoretical distinction provided in the chapter.",
