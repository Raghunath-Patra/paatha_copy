    "correct_answer": "Friction is a force that opposes the motion between two surfaces in contact. It can prevent motion, slow moving objects, or even bring a moving object to a stop.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An object moving with constant speed has balanced forces because the force propelling it is exactly counteracted by opposing forces (like friction and air resistance). For example, when a bicyclist pedals steadily, the push from the pedals and the frictional forces are equal, resulting in uniform motion.",
    "explanation": "This answer emphasizes that balanced forces yield no net acceleration, keeping the objectâ€™s speed constant as described by Newton's first law of motion.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Balanced forces occur when two or more forces acting on an object cancel each other out, resulting in no change in its state of motion. For instance, when a car is parked, gravity pulling it downward and the normal force from the ground pushing upward are balanced. Unbalanced forces, on the other hand, result in a net force which causes acceleration. For example, in the case of a rocket at launch, the powerful thrust force overcomes the gravitational force, causing the rocket to accelerate upward.",
    "explanation": "This explanation covers both balanced and unbalanced forces and links them to everyday examples to illustrate how forces interact to either keep an object stationary or cause changes in motion.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When an object is pushed on a rough surface, friction acts in the opposite direction of the push. If the applied force is small, friction balances this force, and the object remains stationary. As the applied force increases but still does not exceed the frictional force, the object remains in place due to balanced forces. Once the applied force surpasses the frictional force, an unbalanced net force acts on the object, causing it to overcome static friction and start moving. The object then accelerates according to the net force, in line with Newton's second law of motion.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "False. The statement is incorrect because, in a real-world scenario, frictional forces and other resistive forces (like air resistance) eventually bring the object to a halt.",
    "explanation": "While Newton's first law states that an object will maintain its state of uniform motion in the absence of a net force, in practice, resistive forces such as friction and air resistance act as unbalanced forces that decelerate the object, eventually stopping it.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "True. The statement is correct because balanced forces result in no net external force, which means according to Newton's first law, the object will either remain at rest or continue moving with a constant velocity.",
