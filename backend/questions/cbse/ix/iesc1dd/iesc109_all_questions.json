    "correct_answer": "Mass is the amount of matter contained in an object, measured in kilograms (kg), and it remains constant regardless of location. Weight is the force with which an object is attracted toward another body (such as the Earth) due to gravity, measured in newtons (N), and it varies with the local acceleration due to gravity.",
    "explanation": "Mass is a scalar quantity that represents the amount of matter or inertia an object possesses. It does not change with location. Weight, on the other hand, is a vector quantity calculated by the equation W = m × g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. While mass is constant, weight depends on g, which can vary from one celestial body to another. For example, on the Earth g is approximately 9.8 m/s², whereas on the Moon it is much lower, so objects weigh less there. This distinction is fundamental in understanding gravitational interactions in physics.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The weight on the Moon is 1/6th of that on Earth because the Moon has a lower mass and smaller radius than Earth, resulting in a lower gravitational acceleration (g). Since weight is directly proportional to the local value of g (W = m × g), an object experiences only about 1/6th the gravitational pull on the Moon compared to the Earth.",
    "explanation": "Gravitational force depends on both the mass of the celestial body and the square of its radius, as given by the equation g = (G × M) / R². The Moon's mass is much smaller than Earth's and its radius is also smaller, which significantly reduces g on the Moon. Therefore, an object’s weight, which is computed using W = m × g, comes out to be roughly 1/6th of its weight on Earth. This principle reflects the universal law of gravitation and is supported by experimental results and observations, such as those from lunar missions.",

The inward gravitational force acting on the Moon serves as the centripetal force needed to keep it in its circular (or elliptical) path.",
    "explanation": "Newton's insight linked terrestrial gravity to celestial motions. He recognized that if a force acts to pull an object toward the Earth (as seen with a falling apple), then a similar force must be acting on the Moon.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Understanding pressure is essential in various applications. For example, in civil engineering, building foundations are made wider to spread out the load and reduce pressure on the soil, thereby preventing structural damage. In the design of cutting tools, such as knives, a small contact area is preferred because it concentrates the applied force, resulting in higher pressure which allows for easier cutting. Both cases utilize the principle that pressure equals thrust divided by area.",
    "explanation": "These examples show how managing the distribution of force through control of the contact area can lead to safer and more effective designs. In foundations, reducing pressure minimizes soil compression; in cutting tools, increasing pressure enhances the tool’s effectiveness by ensuring the force is applied over a very small area.",

For two objects with the same indicated mass, the one with a larger volume (like a cotton bag) displaces more air and experiences a greater upward buoyant force.

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "It is difficult because the thin strap provides a very small area of contact with the shoulder, resulting in a high pressure (since Pressure = Force/Area) that causes discomfort or pain.",
    "explanation": "When a school bag is carried with a thin strap, the weight of the bag (the thrust) is distributed over a reduced area. According to the pressure equation (P = F/A), a decrease in the area (A) with the same force (F) leads to a significant increase in pressure. This high pressure on the shoulder leads to discomfort, making it hard to hold the bag.",

    "correct_answer": "Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid on an object immersed in it.",
    "explanation": "Buoyancy arises because fluids (liquids and gases) exert pressure in all directions. When an object is immersed, a pressure difference occurs between its lower and upper surfaces, resulting in a net upward force. This phenomenon is described by Archimedes’ principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "An object floats if the buoyant force (upthrust) provided by the water is equal to or greater than its weight, which typically occurs when its density is less than or equal to that of water. It sinks if its weight exceeds the buoyant force, normally because its density is higher than that of water.",
    "explanation": "According to Archimedes’ principle, the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the water displaced by it. If the object's density is lower than or equal to the density of water, the displaced water weighs as much or more than the object, causing it to float or remain suspended. However, if the object's density is greater than water, it does not displace enough water to counterbalance its weight, and it sinks. This principle explains the differing behavior of objects like cork (which floats) and an iron nail (which sinks), even if they have the same mass.",

Mathematically, F = G (M × m) / d².",
    "explanation": "This law, formulated by Isaac Newton, explains that the gravitational force between two objects depends on both their masses and the distance separating them. The formula F = G (M × m) / d² includes the universal gravitational constant (G), and it shows that as the distance (d) increases, the gravitational force decreases as the square of the distance.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "At a given location on Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is constant. Therefore, weight (W = m × g) is directly proportional to mass. This proportionality allows us to use weight as an indirect measure of mass. However, this method has limitations because gravitational acceleration varies from one celestial body to another. For instance, the Moon’s gravitational acceleration is much lower than the Earth’s, so the same object would weigh less on the Moon despite having the same mass.",
    "explanation": "Since g is constant on Earth, any change in weight directly reflects a change in mass.

When you form the ratio Wₘ / Wₑ, the gravitational constant G and the mass of the object m cancel out, leaving: (Mₘ / Mₑ) × (Rₑ² / Rₘ²) or equivalently (Mₘ / Mₑ) × (Rₑ / Rₘ)². Using the approximate values from the table provided (Mₑ = 5.98×10²⁴ kg, Mₘ = 7.36×10²² kg, Rₑ = 6.37×10⁶ m, and Rₘ = 1.74×10⁶ m), the ratio is calculated to be approximately 1/6. This demonstrates that an object weighs roughly one-sixth as much on the Moon as it does on Earth.",
