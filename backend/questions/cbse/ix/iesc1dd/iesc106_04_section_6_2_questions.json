    "correct_answer": "A. Apical meristem – This tissue is located at the tips of shoot and root and is responsible for increasing their length.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C. The bulb’s roots stop growing significantly – Removing the apical meristem halts the growth of roots from that region.",
    "explanation": "Cutting the root tips removes the apical meristem, which is the active site of cell division. Without it, cell production ceases and root elongation is arrested.",

    "correct_answer": "B. They regulate gas exchange through stomata – Guard cells control the opening and closing of stomatal pores, thereby managing the exchange of gases and transpiration.",

    "correct_answer": "Meristematic tissue is composed of actively dividing cells that are responsible for producing new cells in specific regions of the plant, leading to growth. It includes various types such as apical, lateral, and intercalary meristems, which are located at the tips, along the sides, or near nodes, respectively.",
    "explanation": "Meristematic tissues are undifferentiated cells that continuously produce new cells. These cells later differentiate into various specialized tissues (permanent tissues) as they mature, enabling both primary (length) and secondary (girth) growth in plants.",

    "correct_answer": "Differentiation is the process through which cells produced by the meristem become specialized to perform specific functions, forming permanent tissues with distinct shapes and roles.",
    "explanation": "Through differentiation, unspecialized meristematic cells acquire distinct structures and functions, such as those found in parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma.

    "correct_answer": "Parenchyma cells are thin-walled, loosely arranged, and are typically involved in storage, photosynthesis, or even tissue regeneration. Collenchyma cells have irregularly thickened walls and provide flexible mechanical support to growing regions of plants. Sclerenchyma cells are dead at maturity, have thick, lignified walls, and offer structural rigidity and strength.",
    "explanation": "Each tissue type is adapted to specific roles: Parenchyma allows for metabolic functions and storage; collenchyma offers support while still permitting growth and flexibility; sclerenchyma, due to lignification and cell death, provides hard support in regions where flexibility is less required.",

    "correct_answer": "The epidermis protects the plant from mechanical injury and water loss, and it also facilitates gas exchange through structures called stomata.",
    "explanation": "The epidermis forms a protective barrier against environmental stress, pathogens, and excessive water loss due to its waxy coating or cutin. The stomata, which are embedded within the epidermal layer, enable respiration and photosynthesis by regulating the entry of CO₂ and exit of oxygen, along with water vapor during transpiration.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The experiment involves placing two onion bulbs in separate jars of water and monitoring the growth of their roots over several days. In one jar, root tips are cut on Day 4. The onion with intact root tips shows continued root growth, whereas the one with cut tips displays markedly reduced elongation. This difference is attributed to the removal of the apical meristem.",
    "explanation": "Activity 6.1 demonstrates that the apical meristem, located at the root tip, is essential for cell division and subsequent root growth. By cutting off this meristematic tissue, the bulb in that jar loses its primary growing zone, which drastically reduces its ability to generate new cells required for elongation. This experiment effectively links the role of active meristematic tissue with plant growth.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Simple permanent tissues consist of one type of cell and include parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma, which primarily serve roles such as storage, support, and protection. Complex permanent tissues, like xylem and phloem, are made of different cell types coordinated to perform a common function. Xylem, composed of tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma, and fibres, is designed for the transport of water and minerals and provides structural support, while phloem, consisting of sieve tubes, companion cells, and other specialized cells, is responsible for the distribution of nutrients and organic compounds throughout the plant.",
    "explanation": "Simple tissues are uniform and perform basic functions, whereas complex tissues integrate multiple cell types to create efficient systems for transport. The tube-like structure of xylem cells (tracheids and vessels) facilitates the upward movement of water through transpiration pull, and the perforated sieve plates in phloem allow the flow of sugars and nutrients, highlighting the specialization required for effective plant physiology.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Secondary growth, which includes the formation of protective cork, replaces the epidermis in older stems through the activity of a secondary meristem. Cork cells are dead, have thick cell walls impregnated with suberin, and form a barrier against water loss, mechanical damage, and pathogen invasion. This protective layer is essential for the longevity and survival of mature plants, especially in harsh environments.",
    "explanation": "As plants age, the original epidermal layer is insufficient to protect against external stresses. The cork provides a robust, water-impermeable covering that minimizes water loss and shields internal tissues. This adaptation is crucial for terrestrial life, where fluctuations in environmental conditions demand enhanced protective mechanisms.",
