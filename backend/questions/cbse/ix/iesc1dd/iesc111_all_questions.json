    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz).",
    "explanation": "The audible range for human hearing extends from around 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This range represents the frequencies that the average human ear can detect under normal conditions. In this range, the lower frequency limit is associated with very slow vibrations and the upper limit with rapid vibrations. This concept is crucial when considering applications such as audio equipment design and noise regulation, and demonstrates the frequency-dependent nature of sound perception.",

    "explanation": "Infrasound comprises sound frequencies that are lower than the human hearing threshold (below 20 Hz), meaning these vibrations are too slow to be heard by most humans but can be detected by some animals. Ultrasound refers to frequencies above 20 kHz, which are too high-pitched for the average human ear to perceive but are commonly used by animals such as bats and in medical imaging.

    "explanation": "The curved design of concert hall ceilings is based on the principles of sound reflection. When a sound wave hits a curved surface, it is dispersed in many directions rather than being reflected back in a single direction. This ensures that the sound is distributed evenly throughout the hall, reducing dead spots and ensuring that the audience receives clear and balanced acoustics. The concept is similar to the law of reflection where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, but the curved structure modifies the angles so that sound is spread over a larger area.

For an echo to be distinct, the time delay must be at least 0.1 s because the human brain retains the original sound for about 0.1 s. Therefore, if the echo arrives sooner, it overlaps with the original sound and is not distinctly heard. Using the speed of sound (e.g., 344 m/s at 22 ºC), this time delay translates into a minimum round-trip distance of about 34.4 m, hence a minimum one-way distance of 17.2 m. Temperature affects the speed of sound; as temperature increases, the speed increases, thereby altering the distances required for a distinct echo, meaning that at higher temperatures, the necessary minimum distance may become longer.",

    "explanation": "Intensity quantifies the physical power of a sound wave, and its unit is W/m². It is an objective measure determined by the amplitude of the wave. In contrast, loudness is how we perceive that energy; it is influenced by the sensitivity of human hearing to different frequencies. For instance, two sounds with the same intensity but different frequency content may be perceived as having different loudness.

    "explanation": "Loudness, or the perceived volume of a sound, depends on the amplitude of the sound wave. A greater amplitude means a stronger vibration, which produces a louder sound. On the other hand, pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound wave – how many compressions and rarefactions pass a fixed point per unit time. A higher frequency produces a higher pitch.
