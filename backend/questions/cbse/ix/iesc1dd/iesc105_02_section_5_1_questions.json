    "correct_answer": "Leaf peel cells are typically flatter and may contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, while root tip cells are more cuboidal or rectangular and are actively dividing, often with a higher density of nuclei indicating growth.",

    "correct_answer": "First, use forceps to peel off a layer of the onion's epidermis carefully to avoid damage; then, place the peel immediately into a watch glass with water to prevent drying. Next, transfer a small piece of the peel onto a clean glass slide with a drop of water to aid in spreading it flat. Apply a drop of safranin solution to stain the cells for better contrast, and finally place a cover slip carefully to avoid air bubbles. Each step ensures that the specimen is preserved, spread evenly, and stained sufficiently to highlight cell structures for microscopic observation.",
    "explanation": "This procedure is designed to maintain the integrity of the specimen while allowing clear visualization of cells and internal structures. The water prevents desiccation and the stain highlights critical components such as the nucleus and cell wall.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Within a cell, division of labour occurs through the specialization of organelles; for example, the mitochondria produce energy, the nucleus stores genetic material, and the ribosomes synthesize proteins. Similarly, in multicellular organisms, different cells and tissues perform specialized functions—such as muscle cells contracting to enable movement and nerve cells transmitting signals—working cooperatively to keep the organism functioning efficiently. Both levels rely on specialization to optimize functionality.",
    "explanation": "In both individual cells and complex organisms, specialization allows for efficiency and increased complexity. The compartmentalization within cells ensures that vital processes occur simultaneously and in an organized manner, mirroring how different organs work together in a larger system.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Cell theory began with Robert Hooke’s observation in 1665, where he first described the cell structure in cork. Later, Leeuwenhoek improved the microscope and discovered free-living cells in pond water. Robert Brown’s discovery of the nucleus in 1831 advanced the understanding of cell organization. Schleiden and Schwann formulated the cell theory in 1838-1839, proposing that all organisms are made up of cells, and Virchow later added that all cells arise from pre-existing cells in 1855. The invention of the electron microscope in the 1940s provided a much higher resolution view of the cell, revealing complex structures and organelles that were previously undetectable, thereby significantly advancing cellular biology.",
