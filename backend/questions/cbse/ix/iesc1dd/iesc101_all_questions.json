    "correct_answer": "Air < Exhaust from chimneys < Cotton < Water < Honey < Chalk < Iron",
    "explanation": "Density, defined as mass per unit volume, depends on how tightly the particles are packed. Gases like air have particles that are far apart, giving them the lowest density. Exhaust, having additional particles from combustion, is denser than air. Cotton, a loosely packed solid, comes next, followed by water and then honey which are liquids with intermediate densities. Chalk, a porous solid, is denser than liquids and is surpassed by iron, which is highly compact and exhibits a very high density. This ordering is based on the microscopic arrangement and the typical mass per unit volume of each substance.",

    "correct_answer": "a) Gas particles have high kinetic energy and move randomly in all directions, ensuring that they occupy the entire available volume. \nb) The high-speed, random motion of gas particles causes them to collide with the walls of the container frequently, exerting a force per unit area (pressure). \nc) A wooden table maintains a definite shape and volume, has distinct boundaries, is rigid, and shows negligible compressibility, which are characteristic features of solids. \nd) Air, being a gas, has widely spaced particles with weak intermolecular forces, offering little resistance to movement, whereas the tightly packed particles in a solid like wood create strong interparticle attractions, making it difficult to move an object through it.",
    "explanation": "Each part of the question relates to the fundamental behavior of particles in different states of matter. Gas particles are characterized by high kinetic energy and weak intermolecular forces, resulting in complete filling of a volume and pressure exertion upon collision with container walls. In contrast, solids are rigid and maintain their shape because their particles are closely packed and strongly bonded, offering significant resistance to deformation or penetration.

    "explanation": "Water exhibits anomalous expansion upon freezing. The hydrogen bonds in H₂O force the molecules into an open hexagonal arrangement when solid, which increases the volume without a corresponding increase in mass.

    "correct_answer": "Melting ice involves the absorption of heat energy that increases the vibrational motion of its molecules. Once the ice reaches its melting point (0°C or 273 K), the energy absorbed is used to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules rather than raising the temperature. This energy is known as latent heat of fusion and facilitates the transition from a tightly arranged solid structure to a more loosely arranged liquid state.",
    "explanation": "In solids like ice, molecules are fixed in a crystal lattice and only vibrate in place. When heat is applied, these vibrations become more energetic. At the melting point, the energy provided is absorbed solely to overcome the intermolecular forces, causing the ice to change into liquid water without a temperature increase.

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Boiling water involves heating a liquid until it reaches its boiling point (373 K or 100°C at atmospheric pressure). At this point, the energy supplied is used to break the intermolecular forces (overcome cohesion) and transform the liquid into vapor, rather than causing a rise in temperature. This absorbed energy is termed the latent heat of vaporisation. The kinetic energy of the water molecules increases with temperature, and at boiling point, sufficient energy allows molecules from the entire liquid mass to escape into the gas phase.",
    "explanation": "During boiling, despite continuous heat input, the temperature remains constant because the energy goes into changing the state rather than increasing the temperature. The latent heat of vaporisation is the energy needed per kilogram to change the phase, which is critical in understanding boiling phenomena.

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Pressure and temperature are key parameters that determine the state of matter. Increasing temperature generally increases the kinetic energy of particles, leading to phase transitions like melting or boiling. Conversely, increasing pressure forces particles closer together, which can induce a phase change by promoting interactions among particles—such as the liquefaction of a gas. For example, in compressing a gas in a cylinder with a movable piston, reducing the volume increases the pressure, bringing the particles close enough for attractive forces to take over, potentially forming a liquid. In the case of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), under high pressure solid CO₂ sublimates directly to gas when the pressure is reduced to atmospheric levels, illustrating that pressure changes can manipulate phase change pathways.",
    "explanation": "This question examines the interplay between pressure and temperature. High pressure can induce condensation by reducing the space between gas molecules, while high temperature increases kinetic energy leading to less ordered states. The experimental setups such as a compressed gas in a piston-cylinder arrangement or sublimation setups for substances like CO₂ help visualize these principles in real-world applications.

For example, a gas cylinder uses compression to store a large amount of gas in a limited space.",

When the pistons were pushed into each syringe, it was observed that the air-filled syringe's piston could be pushed in easily, demonstrating high compressibility of gases. In contrast, the water-filled syringe offered significant resistance, and the syringe with chalk pieces was almost impossible to compress. The experiment demonstrates that gases are highly compressible, liquids are nearly incompressible, and solids have negligible compressibility.",

    "correct_answer": "Diffusion is the process by which particles spread from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. In solids, diffusion is very slow because particles are fixed in place and can only vibrate within a set position. In liquids, particles can move more freely, resulting in a faster rate of diffusion compared to solids. Gases have particles that move in random, rapid motion over large spaces due to the large gaps between them, which leads to very rapid diffusion. A real-life example is the way the aroma of food quickly reaches different parts of a room when cooking, as the gas particles carrying the smell diffuse rapidly through the air.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "On a hot dry day, high temperature increases the kinetic energy of water particles and low humidity enhances evaporation. The pronounced evaporation from the water-soaked pads in a desert cooler absorbs latent heat, resulting in a more effective cooling process.",
    "explanation": "In a desert cooler, water evaporates from the porous pads. On a hot day, the increased thermal energy provides water molecules the energy needed to transition into vapor. Low humidity in dry air ensures that evaporated molecules are quickly carried away, increasing the evaporation rate. This process absorbs energy (latent heat of vaporization, typically measured in kJ/kg) from the remaining water, thereby cooling the air. This is an example of evaporative cooling, a phenomenon where the phase change from liquid to gas uses heat energy from the environment.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "Water in an earthen pot cools due to the process of evaporative cooling. The porous nature of the earthen pot allows water to seep out onto its surface, which then evaporates. The evaporation process absorbs latent heat from the water remaining inside, thereby reducing its temperature.",
    "explanation": "The pores in an earthen (matka) pot facilitate the slow seepage of water to the outer surface, where it evaporates. During evaporation, water molecules transition from the liquid to the gaseous phase by absorbing heat energy from the water inside the pot. This latent heat of vaporization (measured in kJ/kg) is drawn from the water, causing the temperature of the remaining water to drop. This cooling mechanism is commonly observed in traditional evaporative coolers and is a practical application of heat and mass transfer principles.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When acetone, petrol, or perfume is applied to the palm, they evaporate quickly because they are volatile substances. The rapid evaporation process requires absorption of heat from the skin (latent heat of vaporization), which causes a cooling sensation on the palm.",
    "explanation": "Volatile liquids like acetone, petrol, and perfume have high vapor pressures and low boiling points, which enable them to evaporate rapidly at room temperature. During evaporation, molecules require energy to change from the liquid to the gas phase, and this energy is drawn from the immediate environment—in this case, the skin. As heat is absorbed from the palm to overcome the attractive forces among molecules, the skin cools down, demonstrating the principle of evaporative cooling.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "A saucer has a larger surface area compared to a cup, which increases the rate of evaporation. Faster evaporation from the liquid’s surface removes heat more quickly, cooling the hot beverage faster and making it easier to sip.",
    "explanation": "Evaporation is a surface phenomenon and depends on the exposed area. When you pour a hot liquid into a saucer, the increased surface area allows more molecules to escape as vapor, accelerating the cooling process. This efficient heat loss, due to latent heat of vaporization being absorbed from the liquid, results in quicker cooling compared to a cup that offers a smaller surface area. This concept is a practical demonstration of how geometry and thermodynamics interact to affect heat transfer.",

    "correct_answer": "We should wear light-coloured, cotton clothes during summer. Cotton clothes are breathable, absorb sweat efficiently, and their light colour helps reflect solar radiation, which promotes evaporation of perspiration and thus enhances cooling.",
    "explanation": "Cotton is a natural fibre that is both breathable and moisture-absorbent. In hot weather, the body perspires to cool itself. Cotton absorbs this sweat and allows it to evaporate more readily, facilitating evaporative cooling. Additionally, light-coloured fabrics reflect more sunlight compared to dark colours, reducing the overall heat gain from solar radiation. This combination of properties makes cotton ideal for summer wear, linking material science with thermodynamic principles.",
