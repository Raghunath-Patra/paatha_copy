      "A) Every action produces an equal and opposite reaction.",

      "D) A force is only exerted in one direction."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A) Every action produces an equal and opposite reaction. This is the fundamental statement of Newton's Third Law.",
    "explanation": "Newton’s Third Law states that when one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first. This means forces always come in pairs acting on two separate objects.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B) The forces between the balances are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.",
    "explanation": "The equal readings indicate that the force applied by one balance on the other (action) is matched exactly by the force exerted back (reaction). This directly demonstrates Newton's Third Law of Motion.",

    "correct_answer": "B) The third law of motion generating equal and opposite forces between the bullet and the gun.",
    "explanation": "When the bullet is fired, it is accelerated forward by the force from the gun. Simultaneously, the gun experiences an equal and opposite force (recoil). The difference in accelerations is due to the mass difference; however, the forces are equal as per Newton's Third Law.",

    "type": "MCQ",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": [
      "A) Because less force is applied from that cart.",
      "B) Because the greater mass results in a smaller acceleration for the same force.",

      "D) Because the force acts only on the cart with one child."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B) Because the greater mass results in a smaller acceleration for the same force.",
    "explanation": "According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), for the same force, a larger mass yields a smaller acceleration. Even though the reaction forces are equal, the cart with two children has more mass, which results in a lower acceleration (and less displacement) compared to the cart with one child.",

    "type": "Short Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "The different accelerations arise because acceleration is inversely proportional to mass (F=ma). Although the forces on the bullet and the gun are equal, the bullet has a much smaller mass than the gun, resulting in a higher acceleration, while the gun experiences a lower acceleration due to its larger mass.",
    "explanation": "Newton's Second Law explains that for a fixed force, acceleration decreases as mass increases. This is why, in the gun scenario, the bullet shoots out at high speed and the gun recoils slowly.",

    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "When a person starts walking, they push backward against the ground with their feet, and the ground pushes forward with an equal and opposite force. Similarly, when a gun is fired, the bullet is propelled forward and the gun recoils backward with an equal force. The difference in acceleration in both scenarios is because of the differences in mass. In the walking example, the interaction is between a human and the Earth; the Earth's mass is so large that its acceleration is imperceptible. In the gun example, the bullet, having a very small mass compared to the gun, accelerates rapidly while the gun's much larger mass results in a relatively small recoil acceleration.",
    "explanation": "Both examples illustrate Newton's Third Law, yet the observed effects (different accelerations) are due to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), which shows that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. This combined understanding is crucial to analyzing real-world interactions.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment is to use two skateboards on a smooth, level surface. Two participants stand on separate skateboards facing each other. They hold a heavy medicine ball. When one participant throws the ball to the other, both skateboards roll in opposite directions. In this setup, the thrower exerts a force on the ball, and the ball exerts an equal and opposite force on the thrower, causing a backward motion. Similarly, when the ball is caught, the receiving person experiences a reverse reaction. The observed motion of both skateboards in opposite directions demonstrates Newton’s Third Law, as equal and opposite forces are acting on the two individuals.",
    "explanation": "This experiment uses everyday objects to clearly show that forces come in action-reaction pairs, and that these forces, though equal in magnitude, can produce different accelerations if the masses differ. It reinforces the notion that the forces act on different bodies and explains the observed motions.",
