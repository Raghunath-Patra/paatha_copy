    "correct_answer": "B. The natural tendency of an object to resist any change in its state of motion or rest.",

    "correct_answer": "B. The box filled with books has more inertia because it has a greater mass.",

    "correct_answer": "According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied and inversely proportional to its mass, as given by the equation F = m*a.",

    "correct_answer": "The small cart and the train experience the same force; however, due to their vastly different masses, the cart accelerates more than the train. According to Newton's Second Law (F = m*a), the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass. Thus, with the train's much greater mass and higher inertia, its acceleration is negligible compared to that of the small cart.",
    "explanation": "This example demonstrates how inertia, represented quantitatively by mass, affects the response of objects to applied forces. The train’s high inertia due to its large mass means that the same force results in a minor acceleration, reinforcing the concept that the larger the mass, the slower the change in motion.",

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "One experimental setup involves using two objects of identical shape and size but different masses, such as two boxes—one empty and one filled with books. Place each box on a low-friction surface. Apply a constant force using a spring mechanism or a pulley system, and measure the resulting acceleration with a motion sensor. By comparing the accelerations, you can determine that the box with the greater mass (and higher inertia) accelerates less than the lighter box. This difference in acceleration, together with the applied force, allows you to quantitatively relate mass and inertia based on Newton’s Second Law.",
    "explanation": "The experiment leverages the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration to compare inertia. It applies scientific methods to measure acceleration using sensors and makes use of Newton’s Second Law to explain why objects with larger masses produce smaller accelerations when the same force is applied.",
