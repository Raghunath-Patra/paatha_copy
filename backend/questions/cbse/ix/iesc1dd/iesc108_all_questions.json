    "correct_answer": "The different accelerations arise because acceleration is inversely proportional to mass (F=ma). Although the forces on the bullet and the gun are equal, the bullet has a much smaller mass than the gun, resulting in a higher acceleration, while the gun experiences a lower acceleration due to its larger mass.",

    "correct_answer": "When a person starts walking, they push backward against the ground with their feet, and the ground pushes forward with an equal and opposite force. Similarly, when a gun is fired, the bullet is propelled forward and the gun recoils backward with an equal force. The difference in acceleration in both scenarios is because of the differences in mass. In the walking example, the interaction is between a human and the Earth; the Earth's mass is so large that its acceleration is imperceptible. In the gun example, the bullet, having a very small mass compared to the gun, accelerates rapidly while the gun's much larger mass results in a relatively small recoil acceleration.",
    "explanation": "Both examples illustrate Newton's Third Law, yet the observed effects (different accelerations) are due to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), which shows that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. This combined understanding is crucial to analyzing real-world interactions.",

    "correct_answer": "One possible experiment is to use two skateboards on a smooth, level surface. Two participants stand on separate skateboards facing each other. They hold a heavy medicine ball. When one participant throws the ball to the other, both skateboards roll in opposite directions. In this setup, the thrower exerts a force on the ball, and the ball exerts an equal and opposite force on the thrower, causing a backward motion. Similarly, when the ball is caught, the receiving person experiences a reverse reaction. The observed motion of both skateboards in opposite directions demonstrates Newton’s Third Law, as equal and opposite forces are acting on the two individuals.",
    "explanation": "This experiment uses everyday objects to clearly show that forces come in action-reaction pairs, and that these forces, though equal in magnitude, can produce different accelerations if the masses differ.

    "correct_answer": "Newton's First Law implies that a body in motion tends to stay in motion. During sudden braking, although the vehicle decelerates rapidly due to an external force, the passengers' bodies tend to continue at the original speed because of their inertia. Safety belts provide an additional force that restrains the passenger, slowing them down more evenly with the vehicle, and preventing injury. Similarly, in sharp turns, without a restraining force, a passenger's body would continue in a straight path, leading to displacement relative to the vehicle.",

    "correct_answer": "The logic is incorrect because action and reaction forces act on different objects. The force you exert on the truck is countered by other forces on the truck (such as friction). Thus, the truck does not move because the net external force acting on it is balanced.",
    "explanation": "Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. However, these forces act on different bodies and therefore do not cancel each other on the same object. In the case of the truck, the force you apply acts on the truck, while the reaction force acts on you. The truck remains stationary because its frictional force and other constraints balance the applied force.",
