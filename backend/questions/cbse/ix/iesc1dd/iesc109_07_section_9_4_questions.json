    "correct_answer": "An object's weight is different on the Moon compared to the Earth because the acceleration due to gravity is different. The Moon has a smaller mass and a smaller radius, which leads to a lower gravitational acceleration. As a result, the weight W = m × g on the Moon is about 1/6th of the weight on the Earth.",
    "explanation": "The mass of an object remains constant regardless of location; however, the gravitational force acting on it changes with the gravitational acceleration (g). Since the Moon’s gravitational field is weaker than the Earth’s, the same object weighs less on the Moon.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "At a given location on Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is constant. Therefore, weight (W = m × g) is directly proportional to mass. This proportionality allows us to use weight as an indirect measure of mass. However, this method has limitations because gravitational acceleration varies from one celestial body to another. For instance, the Moon’s gravitational acceleration is much lower than the Earth’s, so the same object would weigh less on the Moon despite having the same mass.",
    "explanation": "Since g is constant on Earth, any change in weight directly reflects a change in mass. This relationship breaks down when comparing weights in different gravitational fields as the value of g is not the same, leading to potential errors if weight is used as a direct measure of mass across different environments.",

    "type": "Long Answer",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "options": null,
    "correct_answer": "To derive the ratio, first note the formulas: For Earth, Wₑ = G × Mₑ × m / Rₑ² and for the Moon, Wₘ = G × Mₘ × m / Rₘ². When you form the ratio Wₘ / Wₑ, the gravitational constant G and the mass of the object m cancel out, leaving: (Mₘ / Mₑ) × (Rₑ² / Rₘ²) or equivalently (Mₘ / Mₑ) × (Rₑ / Rₘ)². Using the approximate values from the table provided (Mₑ = 5.98×10²⁴ kg, Mₘ = 7.36×10²² kg, Rₑ = 6.37×10⁶ m, and Rₘ = 1.74×10⁶ m), the ratio is calculated to be approximately 1/6. This demonstrates that an object weighs roughly one-sixth as much on the Moon as it does on Earth.",
    "explanation": "The derivation uses the universal law of gravitation and shows how the differences in mass and radius of the Earth and Moon affect the gravitational force – and thus the weight – experienced by an object. The ratio emphasizes that while mass remains constant, weight depends on the gravitational parameters of the celestial body.",
